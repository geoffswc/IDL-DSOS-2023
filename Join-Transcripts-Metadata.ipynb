       "\"Hungerford on nicotine metabolism in understanding the problem is human biology medicine if he is in clear I think that the research of many of the speaker's has a pointed out that's the pharmacology biggest thing is highly dependent on the dose of it being the router administration's or rate of inflation how long is it in a good amount,I like the example I was not in my section so the interesting findings on 010 injury, but dr. su casa and I'm soon where they found that if they gave a sustained infusion nicotine in rats with no injury they could protect the neurons from them and that detective effect at the same time in the same animal if they gave a rapid using anything they found quite the opposite that your cells became more injured more damage has a notch, the pharmacodynamic issues involved they could have meant a very remarkable population, and I think we all need to keep that in mind when you ever study were being done from how the nicotine one have to consider very carefully plan the aspects of dosing wouter dosing rate of those things and I would also encourage what off have a level commitment in my local foods that there were more sense of the extraordinary complex, what are the best you the metabolism of nicotine for setting it is important that we know how they can metabolize where metabolize and how fast is another life, we have made some progress I think in the past but that's the past three years work by, dr. Mora has shown very nicely that nicotine is three prime hydroxyl codename nor nicotine has been shown also by the same group the day and time, dr. corbeau has shown in very nice study that may contain code name and Iraq to codeine undergo some sort of a conjugation reaction and that whereas a few years ago it could only account for 60% of making a happy life now if one can congregate examine and white one can account for 85 or 90% of mixing the egg white and wearing, recovery of high percentage of nicotine addiction the urine offer is that I think by far the best Prospect we have of quantitating human exposure both from actress about disease and also environmental essay, we also now that we can measure your driving the cab lights and answer the question that was posed said guys what are individual differences makes me sound like are their genetic influences are their effects of Liberty is on gender we we now have the tools if we didn't have to answer and, girls I have been in some explanation of observations that were made in the past, I'm going to put the dr. Haley is she pointed out that the way we can do a say which has been very widely used to quantitative approaches man be measured not in the pre-code game but but all the congregation over and have a certain amount of activity with a document which I think is very important when you want to go back and try to look at the second see you finding with REI, the environment that I can, dr. Hoffman we viewed it some detail the issue of tobacco specific nature of aiming which of course is in a great concern with respect to Tobacco cotton Avenger, he prevented the very interesting possibility that we can now quantitative initiative closer to receive compound by looking at hemoglobin out which appeared to be markedly elevated computers, perhaps the sudden data can be used for example in the u.s. to persuade manufacturers Republican backed up to lower the nitrate concentration and the Nitro pay and compensation from the backhoe as hasn't been attenuated and I think two or three, dr. Hoffman has also introduced us to a concept of chemo prevention of evacuate cancer which is a very promising so interesting timing for example showing that one can protect against cancer, they force of Medical Training exposure in humans have also continued to be an area of considerable research, they're having several posters in that area in this conference, it hasn't shown by dr. Fisher and comments and colleagues that is that these tobacco is arriving at your paintings seem not to be formed in a paralysis from tobacco but rather they are preformed as part of the exact of curing process, whether I took angry and Douglas Lee remains are enormously important question in assessing the long-term risk than nicotine treatment or any kind of nickname closes had to show that trigger an appointment here that that there is no evidence of nitrification of nicotine which is a tertiary aiming into one of the organic juice, because the equations the Intruder are going to happen however can t beat Euro undergo metastasis reaction much more easily I think a very interesting question about finding that this isn't a paralyzing inhuman is whether this which may be present only small percent less than 1% but if it's nicest ladies could be an important source of Representatives voted I think this is a very important issue, the seismic in metabolism and poster and just what is it that you can get confirmed other words 98 metabolizing lung possibly to a great extent but also translate that the pathway to release and the responses to a junction seem to be quite different one another and the quantitative and qualitative, one of them is certainly learning their movement in human remains a very important when intimate, finally I was just like there's a few comments about the possible role of making metabolites as pharmacologically active agent this was mentioned by a number of everything we've heard effect relation back home you know blood pressure we've seen some data about coping and prostaglandin synthesis and speculation about code name for having able fact and while there's not a lot of data in that regard too far I think it remains to do, important question to evaluate the work of dr. Kathleen Ali was not here before chelated decided to have an abstract I think it's quite important that dealing with the issue that nicotine metabolism generate reactive intermediates like nicotine Megamind which could buy macromolecules and could therefore have on our blogs of art project, thanks, it also found that monoamine oxidase be can metabolize make him am I am I am further to other compounds like to bathe because hiring which have been shown previously that they have funded by taxes even doctors Casino has shown that it may have effects giving back and making him having self and this raises its and an area which I think is very much, which is the issue of local and work in the community, we thought mostly so far about liver metabolism and be toxic A Team Action but it is possible since there are people who can bind other enzyme very cell maybe even bring them that there could be a certain amount of linking metabolism and hard organs and wouldn't be quantitatively a lot of encounters a small generation of reactive intermediates in the brain program for politics have lights at that stage the sales totally for won't be returned could have, quite interesting from another country ability so in summary I think our contributors in the area making metabolism and made important and very relative contributions in understanding the biology mixing and elect to thank all our interviews, from 17 10 July 2010 there were seven sessions I've been diving fixable the cabinet in ten minutes each so the benefits of already taken very dealing 20 minutes but strictly speaking about him sit down immediately and left the next time get off after that, at the moment that gravel Papa and I told him to tell me what to do I'll do it so I'm doing the fact that I'm here and another kind of capacity on the sort of an observer first writing tobacco Research Foundation we just like a poor and remote cousin to the German camp but it's very great pleasure and Reporting back to my colleague at the tremendous success of this making and encourage encourage, AJ our time in our system to put up for a conference with this site and and I had to protect some of you two mixed up, if not for the fact that I always have from reading reading laughter politics and reading about anything convert from one thing connecting with that no pharmacology what it was to me was an exercise in the toxicology of take it they're not the kind of Toxicology that dr. Hoffman but not about but like real toxicology the Taxidermy live with more than one Toxic effect and and an assist residents heard that that the people what, taken to the poison sets and sometimes that perfect and and it makes me think that some of the animal experimentation with nicotine they'd rather more more grated to the shaman practices and South America saying anyone got there from smoking a cigarette cigar part two and back when will that as a direct consequence of that leave, Act of taking the nicotine whether it happened about 250 years of using a dog would not only probably probably haven't been able to get good introduction something else will probably come the tractor I was up now that be more Doctor Who Am I might continue from there from the very interesting accounting Gator served three years ago and the Gold Coast and but, Buddy's hand down some mechanism and and his account of those other changes in insulin so close to producing that doesn't have a job and other other things, remember that that that people people work on the transmitter for years ago and they understanding anything anywhere they say nothing's happening is making which anything about any transmitted up you which is which is a system of that 25 years old and of course the number of transmit those guys are and normal for every five years and danger they did to us, Target for dictatorship, have to do with smoking them not my problem right by the front door oh good because I don't know whether something about nicotine on BET she'll perform totalitarian in diabetes mellitus from turkey again not varying related that if I can get to a relationship now, and I must say that his introduction with a clear effect addition I'd ever heard of defense's this is a beautiful unfortunate identity Construction, and one of the effects of nicotine are very positive and sometimes a writer that name his group had three posters on this on the question on the aspects related to it the role of epithelium in the reactivity to maintain as important as a church and as it's clear that one leads to hook into into newly discovered physiological maintenance with the role of empathy, helium in pulmonary disease and they are actively and in responses to various strategies including receiving emphasis in the last five years and perhaps perhaps after I put back to cook connection with the next one from from Professor how many groups for the Mid-South Regional nerve no confidence in Hideaway where they were talking about about from Los Angeles, a math problem site until that is also, from a piece you enter the grappler is a pinky ourselves which are which took with in the last few years we've realized were vitally important or control tower investment function and enormous overlooked in in relation to nicotine, probably a lot of things that attracted me about is in certain intervals of the genes Prime the bleeding and what other thing that is nervous and for those aspirin which will help him away forever Bond reducing reducing, cerebral vascular approaches to sort of thing from the foods that first car in reverse order they're all desirable medication but it appears there's a variety of different fish that nicotine has the same time it does tomorrow, I encourage the formation of flightless and and we heard more about them at that sort of thing in the last session I think particularly from dropping the pain of it but I never seem to me to be a lot of contradictions and they were families of the victims like of the organizers question to ask, they can have a lot more and and that was really the basis of the of the visitors can climb I know that I think we've made in our drop to one another by the wrong, they only had to drop the top ten and of the already had one remember it's already created that by talking about the different results depending on the brightness protective action of nicotine that, trying to drive a drive with a very special spectrum of activity and but again the bottom line is we need to know a great deal more about I think I made it in 10 minutes, I wonder what we could really is to it country's worsening the so good half of would add something to it but I think what I'd like to do is just to review a couple things and makes an overall comments about how II see 90s and things better first of all Becca Holt paper would be beginning trying to understand, how are you coping mechanisms - people with one of the things that we had a lot of good research on structural receptors and things like that it's like two groups and Diesel and petrol stifling pretty far apart we need to really continue that trying to look at a variety of molecular approach zero condition I really enjoyed that paper Wonderlocke you did great excellent job explaining to me some things are real, exactly use paper very interesting to me those who are high in many ways that are really thin pointed out the role most fanciful and brain and - welcome very mind and I think I can come and go right on appreciate all these systems so much dr. Dave paper with very interesting from the 20th, view of using model and showing the media content and affecting both full-time and the transplant approach that's going to be the future is probably as some degree with important thing we can see that someday we're going to be cells, dr. Clark's one constant in London together for the purpose of just trying to say we getting an idea about wearing it if you might be working in terms of projection systems I think is the question is effect on dopamine systems I have any question do we really have to Innovation to make it to my professor and I don't think we really have them but what I didn't impression, and I'm pretty sure that what happened in the brain is that all the furniture stuff you would call me because when a person has a and most of the negative perceptions Christmas that's all began to feel is that this money thing in Arrangement certainly hello but this might be very much wife's job the purple one on the temperature is a really special one thing's missing was really, in terms of the posters from Paris were looking at the same time two things you don't need to turn over those people which was very interesting paper has some different Lincoln to do internally, a couple questions on current legal profession and that's what another thing you might consider for the next meeting for the organizers really haven't discussed the development of any kind of course I think we were really begun to understand how, my client and how it might impact or be safe or how we might use encryption to protect again were beginning to really use some good methods I think a team of Surgeons are getting way more sophisticated as we bring in the rest of Science and Neuroscience and become way more sophisticated now being using techniques, I'd like to just make a couple of comments of what I how I think we can we can do things will be better one of the things is I was so impressed with the cigarette reinforcement day this morning I haven't had a cigarette near but I figured I'd try them see if I can get reinforced because I get some pleasure at it and it may be anything from it I just make that point I think what dr. ran mentioned is that we're dealing with pretty much the most, in terms of reinforcement behavior and wonder what is really happening at the dopamine system is this just a an incidental effect on the system will demonstrate toward the stress activate the system which what's really going on here you know I think what we'll try pulling everything together with one trip every drug work on building so I just wonder what what that really means and I say this because I had to sit long time zone which I something called me up and said you know, I said that more fully the nicotine acts and morphine receptive than ever and he said yes make them only walks and the recent publication that they said that I showed the neck and Roman block nicotine like naloxone blocks morning so obviously morphine isn't too keen on Sam and so I just caution of the mid terms of how we look at this and I want that what the role of Life quality that all might help us explain some of the data, open happening and it might be a much better drugs he visited them becoming president in terms of comparing nanak and drug testing, another thing which I I noticed about people using tag inside each other but an incident that happened to me was in fragments of I walk nicotine's affecting discrimination with helping other part I really think and I could replicate data to what it is went back to measure nicotine levels and I woke me and so I wonder I think maybe one wiser somebody somewhere to do a study looking at trying to make the team level to see if the Lord what they want to do with other Witnesses, it was going to be in front of a line you might potentially intervene nobody that hates working in felonies working by the relationship of the updates of New Millennium but what they found was competing with that will deliver an increasing level of antibody greater potentiation, and the last point I'd like to make concerns you know one of the things that we do in Pharmacology and especially seeing as we inject drugs but lat like what humans don't they'll are injected by an experimental eject himself as a very interesting paper bond between them which who looked at substance tough electrostimulation what you get you had two groups of rats one with yourself to demonstrate self-employed and one that we've been stimulated, investigators then promise but when we looked at you I see blue carpet and included in other words if you inject an animal that you ought to be affecting quite different than the animal self administration of drugs so what I would like to see long-term lesson study them with all these technique in which you have animal self administer a drug to see what the difference is really on and making use of some some other technique, confused by people who work with getting induced Howard Epps you wish you can create custom initiation drugs by external stimuli density but now and I do the same thing, but basically at this point I think we're really moving right nicely and the right in the direction of really trying to figure out what having maintained and I think and how they getting is interacting with receptive and it's important to be here and I think Alex dr. Otis auction, on behavioral effects of nicotine in any boobs I felt the will not contest that I am doing that in the shadow of my chairman for visibility and I must confess that I am like neither and biological behavior is no new neuropharmacology is a professional psychologist and especially not a general cycle facilities because I put the icing to refer to this session, but I am attempting apologies so if the boat is being slowly into the situation by the sometimes enigmatic wisdom I want to stay of the program committee so I'm here and I've tried our being not familiar with this field and doing that like being a bit option Journey with a very high level in the stratosphere and looking down on you and what has happened here I see it right you know I think right way, they can only get from an impression now about so, when I try to do them, I can refer to the brilliant introduction which was called like a refugee from the metagame to the beginning but if I ask is if we ask one what will we do with experiments with behavioral experiment in animals I think because can only be present models and they have to be amped to answer some questions that have been dealt with in the morning papers to in this presentation, now what these questions I want to repeat why do people smoke quality after 8:00 why does not know everybody and by will be smoking those different extent why are the different smoking habits even kind of taking in the better World -, in India really psychological type of dependency what about nicotine tolerance what is the role of neurotransmitter systems for the tour of the receptors we return to the words of my medical report of rosenkranz yet it just before and what is influenced by the nicotine use are there synergistics are I am Hunter dualistic the architects involved only a little, coming out of the spectral questions I think and even bothers have to answer and the question I put to myself I posted myself listening to it as I told you as a Layman was how far are these questions are answered how far they are going to can they be answered by the methods by the methodological approaches we have just now and how part in how far have they been haunted by the brilliant presentation really hits, head in the morning, what is the basic already pointed out the main thing that there is a gap in between, the missing link between the animal experiments on that we know about we not we don't know about men Behavior there, but the presentation this morning show different approach is dr. Barbara and dr. Pollack Corrigan's going else in your family they try to the ain't that the question of the dopamine dopamine dopamine are Netflix history and the situation the role of the methyl methyl limbic system, but was the results complete demonstrate and explain into conduction of nicotine dependence in men I beg you pardon all of the officers if I had a Layman ask questions and not summarize the things is as I told you the Brilliance doesn't take the deal it's not and criticism Kathy it's only you know to show you Google for instance what what is not so clear to me at least that, because I'm not lecturing on the the level I should be but what if it clear that they have a heater working on liberating secreting behavior in rhesus monkeys monkeys have them has demonstrated behind it have two results you showed us I think you should also less than hiring a variant perhaps being dependent on factors of environment of the move either like men more perhaps than, and small laboratory animals and it showed us us decided the problems of the time our schedules of these experiments being behind his results I think what dr. Collins demonstrating demonstrating the interaction of Convoy receptors and nicotine receptors brought some of the open questions I think to the point, I think with regard to the genetic differences in the role of receptors the interaction of Rights for instance with hot voice but we had some poster for instance of Covenant is Co-operators from Baltimore and Zurich about the behavioral interactions of nicotine and caffeine quiz to the must be the might be because of hope that they are still more about, my impression yeah our insight and understanding of these, inventions of receptors and interactions of different dragon is priced as now and he is not a person be commenting in spite of what to say so in spite of the very interesting posters we saw outside Britain's the poster being done in this figure showing the interaction that I already told with Cohen and Co-operators is nicotine and coughing the, post of dealing with protected covid receptor reset the actions and alterations of went and Jana and Co-operators from Jerusalem about the quality night the chapters and related behaviors are very early exposure to nicotine that means the question is evolved deposit equations induction of receptors, and the other, paper the other poster of the also like roof is now Incorporated influence of new neighbors because nicotine exposure and development of nicotine receptor once more the exact impression of deduction of receptors one of the three is the Rosa County has referred to being open being open also indication of down-regulation of interaction and one way of the mingle in the looking at different, complex in regulation of receptors of nicotine and all these problems being connectivity, what, in respect of the Great Barrier abilities of metabolism and behavioral reactions to practice even from one string to the other in inbred animals and the interdisciplinary into individual descriptions in higher Dimensions only quite restricted Lee defined experimental models can be successful like Billy so for instance the poster of risk coast of Chile show, the differences in the responses of Roman high and low avoidance red Swensons in Behavior so I think everybody has to be aware of these differences when dealing with different strengths too wet environment millions of his head with the individual differences I think new methodological especially molecular biological approaches a non-functional receptors and the regulation interaction down, regulation as they mentioned already under nicotine affects my promise the way to fill up to get you no understanding between, animals and men's behavior and after now I think at least it's my inspiration all attempts to explain the human behavior on tobacco smoking but by experimental results when animals are more than fragmentary and so I think in three years we will have great success in listening listening I hope to two new results than quite a lot of work to be done but I think thank you, how about the behavioral changes which were produced by smoking doses of drugs and what I want to do is bring to pick up on three different themes and which seemed to have come out of the presentations firstly it seems to me those things smoking doses of nicotine to have really rather subtle effect in, it might be predicted by the use of rather Hefty doses in animals the changes that people require sophisticated testing we saw a number of different examples of that and I may have missed them I may have been doing during one on in high marches to three slides and miss them but it seemed to me that he had at least within the session where and the posters there were at least eight different types of performance which route, proved from Reaction Time recognition tag tracking tasks the attentional task to achieve a serum and a pair of posters critical flicker Fusion be short-term memory task memory search and then we separate and memory Pros really quite a wide spectrum from really quite simple psychomotor test for really quite complicated cognitive functions so and I think some of the major advances we're from the Queensland have been the, evidence of a he has been proved in addition to that we had the interesting notion who might be possible to relate some of these effects to collection for the right to have Capital account and as reflected in the EEG and and fudgy driving so at least we're getting some sort of clues about the mechanisms of action that are being produced by the changes in cognitive, a function which are being produced by the drug now it seems our citizens changes around the circle and in our hands we are getting by descent to 10% Improvement but I know some of you out there this evening with by The Writing Center 10% Improvement and welcomes of smartness drive to help you along the last out the next 10 or 15 minutes, the other thing that I mentioned alluded to it but it wasn't directly heartedly the other presentations but differ also seem to be moved Improvement now these are not really romantic you for a changes like to like John went out and has got last night because I really wanted something to go in and work in Magic on those don't mean system and I said due to be doing community is very disappointing, nevertheless it does seem to have some sort of effect of happiness and I showed its roots scales where it was an improvement it people that all content in more friendly the really quite gentle subject changes in addition to that we have also got ever done this is that producer common effect really psychological we're just demonstrating what Focus we played no role in Easy is so how could we look at these and ready to take, the point B transpose rho mean when we talk about pleasure really we are really quite happy with rather subtle sort of Pleasures really a small amount of carbon for smaller increase in affability friendliness is something that we're seeking when if we can combine that with a 10% improvement in our cognitive function really we're onto something and I think the way that maybe we should look at this one is we can say that smokers work on, usually born as deficient and they smoking to a normal life level and that one View and I know one of them not happy about it the other one that I can hold also and I changed my mind before breakfast weather which one I go for it I can also believe that there is an enhancement effect and I think we've had some evidence that evening it doesn't seem to matter whether you're a heavy smoker occasional smoker or nonsmoker you can get this effect you can get them whether, are abstinent or they are non abstinent and he said to me important aspect which would in K indicated an absolute enhancement model would also cover the data and then I suppose covering as the Americans say covering my ass I can actually say that you can have both of those you can have some sort of model which says the smoking is servicing serving some sort of function for you and you will be the pleasure you're getting at is controlling our psychological State calm yourself, and making yourself a better Market protocol and in conclusion I want to thank the participants who make it an interesting Symposium for me and have a code to receive the people in the next three years thank you very much, formation across the core Tech and then it's a case where the person Air Force going through when today our Focus area and to the motor cortex and very much the same sort of movement through from primary visual area across the cortex motor cortex is involved in a lot of the cognitive tests with the described this morning and I'll be describing insulator on the next slide please, slide is just showing the very brain systems which we believe a traffic control in the cortex and in particular very important pathway is the cholinergic pathway set ascending from the new casaya\""
