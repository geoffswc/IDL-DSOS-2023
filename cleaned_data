ets causes million cases asthma say that right know anybody really said that i m martha persky epa report say ets clauses twenty six thousand new cases childhood asthma base claim risk factor elsewhere report say evidence insufficient inconclusive say ets actually cause asthma kids science advisory board panel also said evidence insufficient say ets causes asthma i m confused evidence insufficient say ets risk factor induction asthma therefore causes twenty six thousand cases evidence insufficient ready believe i ve heard one moth times eye keep trying tell call risk factor say know know sufficient claim sufficient evidence say causes cancer better causes asthma studies mechanistic studies present report suggests factors present ets add risk developing asthma know one studies examined martinez martinez risk completely disappeared mother years formal education therefore seems strange ets really causing asthma would cause it also children whose mothers years formal

jfhb0039,"Las Vegas focus group discusses a new smokeless cigarette. They question whether or not the taste, ash, and quality is the same as a normal cigarette.",tobacco; cigarette; taste; smokeless; ash,Las Vegas cigarette focus group,00:19:13,always implant barbara creative crushed consider well cigarette butt impact lungs say others terms cancer well think recognize cigarette smoking carries level risk have impact mean risk can t say okay right think say cigarette going see things constructed everything going come back think going want ask question take look chance see materials yeah know cigarette that s another one common questions people ask kind confusing thing think couple signals get used smoke eclipses happens designed last six seven minutes length standard king size cigarette start get done eclipse notice start getting less smoke smoked taste weaker signals clips done it ll go want relight point extracted flavor cigarette put like regular cigarette know happen paul let one up taking couple puffs walk away okay well cigarettes also come different strengths different sizes eclipse come four styles may going become day eclipse eclipse miles non mental well mental still going start selling terms terms tar nicotine questions that s good one think maybe good idea show what s slow okay yeah yeah yeah put yeah later way works live eclipse taken couple pops lay walk away it ll probably go within minute came back could relight finish smoking however towards end walk away probably going cool go finish want relight point flavor would gone really depends smoke making looking know whether newer used okay know fact anytime start fire lighting something produces ash resin where s residence going terms tobacco the what s actually way working heating rather burning light tip happens tip gets high creates heat going said makes full flavored smoke come tobacco rather burning okay that s great analogy that s outstanding cooking rather burning yes cigarette smoke end ripped apart would see going find going see smoke one let s guess going see inside barbara thinks gonna see ashes tobacco burn okay think going see ashes ashes bennett going guess tobacco question tar nicotine let s let s talk moment full flavor brands anywhere milligrams char white cigarettes less anywhere milligrams ultra light cigarettes even less usually mg eclipse three milligrams tar eclipse miles one milligram tar many may familiar methods use measure tar used cigarettes burned too go melinda mentioned glycerin included tar clips primarily heats rather burns tobacco virtually tar burning tobacco dissipation noticed like filter like fabric around correct right absolutely yep question that s asked tip cigarette noticed heat barrier question heat barrier heat barrier made something called spun glass burn add anything smoke already insulates high purity carbon tip makes lot less likely start fire stops burning back problem talk getting around filter like stuff nylon said glass well therefore helped us fund spun glass burning adding anything smoke another cigarettes anywhere think think great hanson personal come tip well see little piece right maybe got one come think that s little bit yeah doctors say far comparing cigarettes product consumer would better person yeah think that s excellent question let s let s let s talk back cigarettes think acknowledge smoking carries some risks question mean without risk can t say think say primarily heats rather burns tobacco think common sense would tell carries worse risk cigarettes may fact carry less scientists looking cigarettes smoking years rj reynolds would welcome independent studies cigarette perhaps time able measure potential reduction reduction risk comes this think surgeon general would say cigarette well surgeon general say much new brand cigarette comes least nothing favorably can t speak surgeon general s going say think they re going say may probably think they re like rest talk nickname second mary ask question back full flavored cigarettes comparing two eclipse full flavor brands anywhere point eight one point seven milligrams nicotine like cigarettes less between x course alter light cigarettes even less usually point point five eclipse zero point two milligrams nicotine mild style milligrams nicotine okay people smoke cigarettes oiled edification suspect nicotine that s part hard quit smoking think nicotine go withdrawal what still oral satisfaction nicotine body used marry think terms nicotine satisfaction that s something every smoker going determine tell people across country smoke cigarette many people adopted cigarette testing we ve done adopt cigarette believe satisfying smoke anymore usual brand think we ve situations may switched one brand another that s cigarette satisfying going go back usual brand think that s something person going make mind market anywhere right present know want know what s going law liked enough people like opportunity listen saying smoke product decide try get like question question cost back cost manufacture will charging price marble benson hedges i m cigarettes like find store like migraines can t smoke irritates mean really bothers would escape eclipse would better think that s really difficult question answer really predict it would better eclipse know smoke quite different mostly water glycerin whether would okay situation think could predict would morrow try going may still controversy surgeon general they re trying stop kids smoking introducing cigarette may stop smoke may problem think cigarettes going kill the everybody think there s people going claim that s problem think right people go look reasons try let s hope enforce age restriction laws feel kids can t get hands cigarettes question there s little nicotine whereas that s nicotine that s coming drapery fabric whatever actually us ours o tar nicotine time eclipse stay inside rather come that s good question answer talking earlier clips primarily eats rather burns there s virtually tar burning tobacco early flue cured tobacco domestically produced tobacco much cigarettes finding market really melinda said there s nothing added tobacco like terry meant paper kevin answered question somebody else earlier asked know standard sick couple extra overlaps attach tip filter cigarettes attaching filter couple extra layers said going come of regular light menthol said right depending market survey trust ryan example cigarettes smokers prefer full bodied full flavor cigarettes clips light smokers eclipse miles true mental smokers cigarette leave smell breath smoking like that s good lost boyfriend know nonsmoker know want go someplace high smoke cigarette first thing smoking told guys get smoke show keep fourth regular maybe road make longer right they re going come standard king size car take home yes heat barrier question heat barrier heat end end made material called spun glass purpose keep charcoal tip getting hot burning back paper heat barrier burn add anything smoke cigarette smoke thank you questions question lighted okay lucille smoking clips length usual cigarettes six seven minutes started getting less smoke smoked taste sweeter weaker eclipse goes means eclipse done want relight point flavors taken literally clips took couple drags walked away went came back could light point finish smoking questions what s carbon tip like charcoal used barbecue carbon tip eclipse made high purity carbon heat source cigarette anything bets worse cigarette scam eclipse uses standard tobacco blend there s nothing tobacco another cigarettes yes carbon tip make like carbon monoxide other cigarette eclipse milligrams carbon monoxide actually less leading lights cigarette questions yes eclipse going cost conventional regular cigarettes know cost us manufacture eclipse different charging price would pay full price brand like marble newport carlton winston another question question yes eclipse safer think understand smoking cigarettes carries risk safer asking without risk can t say consider fact eclipse primarily heats rather burns tobacco think common sense would tell worst case looking risk different cigarette may fact less risk scientists studying cigarettes years rj reynolds would welcome independent objective studies cigarette perhaps time able measure much risk may reduce time couple quick drags something put really can t put light happen light get going lasts minutes walk away it ll keep going might cool go back pick take extra puff get going one thing eclipse that s different can t smash light later what s that s interesting katene amount nicotine cigarette regular cigarette good question going talk tar nicotine maybe it d good idea show what s smoke nice coaching mostly water glycerin sense like vapor smoke blow see kevin s got lot smoke coming disappears really quickly like breath cold morning something like nobody ever said burn tobacco order smell good really simply heats allows extract flavor reason burn tea leaves make know heat water extract flavor similar actually hollowed out cylinder think s inside would say never backhoe come get chance smoke cut one open take look what s inside properties regular cigarette mean far as taking body yes there s nothing tobacco cigarette tobacco cigarette rob put test right sometime take regular cigarette blowing smoke handkerchief lead leads big stain stun handkerchief what s going happen thing love asked question like demonstration later illustrates i ll go ahead answer eclipse stain fantastic question greg would say level nicotine level nicotine great comparing clips cigarettes full cigarettes nicotine levels ranging point eight milligrams mg light cigarettes less anywhere point six point mg ultra low tar cigarettes point point five eclipse zero point milligrams nicotine mi style milligrams nicotine mean smoke people smoked cigarette tell they re smoking anymore think issue raising gaynor one satisfaction think we ve switched tried different brands cigarettes sometimes cigarette satisfied smoke one one find wanting smoke that s cigarette tell people smoked switch tell surprisingly satisfying cigarette given level tar nicotine target date available consumer know exactly yet right middle talking lot consumers like lot smokers like letting try eclipse cases try cigarette two waiting see reaction waiting give us cue ready think ready still talk smokers like confirm far good though results encouraging much long been working melinda developed idea years serious rj reynolds working many many years reason reynolds working product

tests whatever know federal government regulate cigarettes asking question tests done independent tests cigarette answer absolutely yes time cigarette launched tests may try one going let try minute okay like said okay oh saying pick smoke flavors i ll know pick take couple puffs get smoke finished cigarette going remain whole like question question question question would ask bus would rather house empty does dover empty casing that s part heat barrier piece food grade aluminum foil that s laminated conventional cigarette paper wraps around cigarette that s keep tobacco igniting cigarette

congress conferred upon can t believe congress courts would happy court challenge obviously seeking invalidate law know many congressmen including senator ford kentucky indicated think congress given dr kessler authority they re talking taking action well appears tobacco become top priority david kessler that light responsibilities he s got officially food drugs well there s lot speculation saw article paper day speculated perhaps reason dr kessler tried take tobacco guise smoking criticism directed agency s failure give quick approval life saving drugs life saving medical devices agency come tremendous amount attack failure address issues like food ingredients hear people food company takes long get new food ingredient approved fda fda tremendous amount attack dr kessler particular clear failings clearly law responsibilities speculated reason gone tobacco talk you smoking try divert attention real problems i m beth partington miller brewing company milwaukee question several federal agencies jurisdiction tobacco products david kessler s motivation trying get fda involved point could set precedent products contain alcohol caffeine well think pretty clear david kessler agenda motive made clear articles come recently recent assertion jurisdiction made clear preoccupation smoking cigarettes last two years perhaps even far back became commissioner food drug administration think quite clear wants exercise jurisdiction order control cigarettes manufacturing sale cigarettes marketing cigarettes united tate s think also realizes would difficult thing beginning might succeeded getting administration support effort he s cloak effort saying really he s interested keeping cigarettes away kids know also interested keeping cigarettes away kids recently announced enhanced program try restrict access cigarettes you fact matter would kessler ever succeed getting jurisdiction cigarettes would power ability go much simply promulgating regulations youth access fact would power declare cigarettes unsafe ban entirely market really believe opinion ultimate purpose objective prohibit smoking and fighting effort vigorously let federal government fda come illegally seized power never conferred upon congress make decisions affect ability adults country determine whether want smoke million adult smokers country enjoy lawful product david kessler determine continue use product question underage smoking issue philip morris support national legislation addresses youth smoking issue actually already federal legislation addressing youth access issue important point legislation sponsored former congressman mike sign required states begin address issue youth smoking congress made decision democratically controlled congress time republican president democratically controlled congress passed law president bush signed said state issue states need establish licensing schemes retailers state s need undertake programs enforce laws make sure existing laws making illegal sell cigarettes kids unfortunately congress assign responsibility developing model regulations department health human services regulations never even come three years later exhibiting true commitment issue worked even waiting regulations come federal government worked hard last years minimum age purchase every state united states we ve worked licensing part recent program we ve announced new commitment limiting smoking furtherance existing commitment said going sample cigarettes anymore going send cigarettes mail going work retailers educate public minimum age purchases going help train retail employees going sanction certain retailers comply law going work state legislators congress told us get legislation on books states impact that s real meaningful program think we ve put forward lot people joining us try make happen make happen real quickly thank thank steve want go back finish answer second part question best dr kessler successful achieving jurisdiction cigarettes could seek assert jurisdiction caffeine alcohol think answer probably could that s think americans whether like smoking concerned he s cigarette considered dr kessler delivery device nicotine coffee delivery advice device caffeine beer delivery advice alcohol milk delivery device cholesterol slippery slope give dr kessler authority go cigarettes there s reason jurisdictionally logically could not embark upon attack upon product happen suit particular like think serious problem industry many industries american public generally think last election showed one thing certainly showed american people interested heaven unelected bureaucrat washington telling live lives although cigarette advertising directed towards adult market must unavoidable appeal youth philip morris standards minimize youth appeal given marketing program absolutely standards let get minute first let say studies done subject advertising entice kids smoke pretty clear fact they re clear advertising makes people we ll start smoking fact interesting i ve seen interviews television reports newspapers interviews kids say advertising that s smoke peer pressure fact parents smoke lot different things advertising makes people smoking lot studies actually cited surgeon general surgeon general s reports congress said strict guidelines number years place cigarette advertising example currently play cigarette billboards within feet schools example strict guidelines publications place cigarette advertising publication small percentage youth readership advertise publications real serious things we ve number years following alex s question think timing recent press releases led people believe action access program really done response congressman waxman indeed started quite bit sooner absolutely last year institute medicine issued report federal government subject youth smoking institute medicine made number recommendations things could done address issue came last year took look report lot things recommended report incorporated action access program we ve long standing commitment we ve leader industry things keep cigarettes hands kids institute medicine report came took look said things decided take steps going going matter happens food drug administration happens congress committed issue shoe restrictions put company regards sponsorship events affect one event marketing group direct marketing group effect events sponsor consumers events that s good question regulations proposed would dramatic effect impact ability sponsor events like ability people participate vents events continue participate events might disappear altogether think important remember lot reasons believe proposals go effect first filed lawsuit think successful prevent fda asserting jurisdiction us also seen great opposition consumers people involved events expressed proposal community going communicated congress fda think likely proposals actually take effect certainly would dramatic impact okay heat facing philip morris also heat tobacco industry facing affirmative steps taking attract employees philip morris steps taking retain employees currently let try second part first trying whole lot things aggressively work make position known public going thing employees know personal experience know everybody room gets questions they re friends serious potential problem want get word public want get word employees going aggressively heard jeff he s committed issues issues going aggressively know human resources department everybody else who s involved

He believes that nicotine shouldn't be compared to caffeine and that smoking is safe.,tobacco; cigarette; health; nicotine;,INTERVIEW DR. ROBINSON TAPE,00:31:06,dropped off let let start dr robinson article particularly interested effects nicotine called role nicotine tobacco use argue people smoke kind paradox stimulates relaxes tell mean that article written get common sense perspective exactly title role nicotine tobacco use think common sense tells effects nicotine tobacco smoke fundamentally different addictive drugs heroin cocaine course surgeon general stated common sense approach opposed chemical analysis yeah think trained scientist see fundamental differences effects nicotine cigarettes smoking caffeine instance coffee drinking compared addicting drugs known time precise point made surgeon general s report role nicotine tobacco use much closer role caffeine coffee drinking predict drugs think still fundamentally true that s common sense approach opposed chemical analysis nicotine chemical analysis caffeine sort thing well go science also key focused article key distinction nicotine caffeine addicting drugs intoxicating effects addicting drugs definition addiction always included concept intoxication debilitation disruption ability think clearly perform simple tasks that s issued fortune that s true throughout history course apply nicotine surgeon general s report requirement dropped nicotine act people i m gonna quit chemically reacts differently think different people effects think certain beneficial effects cigarette smoking surgeon general instance would say people smoke addicted nicotine fact think asked someone aside enjoyment say obtained smoking think get people report specific effects one report helps relax helps calm helps cope life s everyday stresses strain secondly reported helps concentrate helps keep alert that s paradox asked previously smokers reported for time recently evidence effects demonstrated scientific studies laboratory laboratory laboratories effects physically happens person uses nicotine cigarettes pharmacology nicotine mild know exactly respond happens physically well person takes puff happens nicotine enters body happens brain happens nervous system that s that s well understood point see happens understand happen cigarette smoking nicotine mild pharmacology associated interact receptors brain extent interaction known extent very people report mild relaxation stress reduction coping ability concentrate better maintain alertness particularly boring psychologists called learn tasks simple task that s that s effects noticed behavioral kinds effects i m curious tell us physical effects act nicotine introduced body terms brain whether brain whether body wants there s little doubt think either smoking opponents us would agree smoking pleasurable activity certain amount pleasure associated certainly mentioned present kind addicting drug that describing mi pharmacology qualified discuss length specific receptor interactions know whether body craves nicotine well would like time time think john dr robinson describing mild pharmacology describes behavioral aspects nicotine absorbed pack throughout body produces behavioral effects described think physical manifestation nicotine unlike caffeine drink coffee people drink coffee caffeine report increase alertness that s physical manifestation caffeine present drink decaffeinated coffee going report alert guess would add psychologist behavioral person total behavioral effect area expertise necessarily specific mechanisms underlying behaviors written several articles questioning surgeon general s report explain wrong article without report well formulate common sense perspective report basically ie physiologic behavioral effects nicotine cigarette smoking much closer caffeine coffee drinking addicting drug known known stated quite clearly surgeon general s report behavioral effects nicotine much closer caffeine heroin cocaine the surgeongeneral saying surgeon general got right got wrong yes i m much comfortable approach comfortable idea nicotine addictive think think that s exactly wrote article put common sense perspective claim kind standpoint think addictive think classically accepted definition word addiction key focus article intoxication debilitation there s always fundamental part definition addicting drug think obviously nicotine produce intoxication there s debilitation disruption ability think clearly perform simple tasks fundamental concepts and drug exhibited cigarette smoking nicotine surgeon general reviewed thousands articles concluded addictive saying articles wrong i m saying i m saying conclusion reached serious disagreement reason stated intoxication debilitation affect anybody s ability think clearly decide whether continue taking continue smoking side there s whether there s there s disruption person s ability think clearly lose voluntary control whether continue taking continue smoking think people problem stopping think look literature million people government s numbers smoking without plus percent without help without intervention ask simply say willpower i m saying say quite clearly article think fundamentally cigarette smoking accurately classified habit saying people may report difficulty giving smoking like habit like well like behavior pleasure give may difficulty change fundamentally changing behavior difficult task ask anyone who s tried stay diet without much success think that s true extent better okay good detractors say agenda bias work tobacco companies fact work tobacco company think way influences views conduct sound science sciences scrutinized extremely carefully go publish article simply work agenda one speak best science published opinions refereed journals people become detractors that s science put let s discuss many studies funded tobacco companies support view idea many many study possible possible none would idea say would say know number studies funded funded industry versus funded government agencies specifically preface surgeon general s report stated quite clearly one purposes report support smoke free society year would imply funding study university would affect study funded and agree funded people actually work surgeon general agree surgeon general s conclusion either really course many people many people many people quit many people can t many many people find people find difficult quit like habit like people unwilling stop drinking coffee unlike addiction like habit fundamental difference dr robinson s already talked issue intoxication intoxication smoking that s effect among many effects mean necessarily euphoria either still craving continual supply nicotine could might crave crack cocaine concept intoxication key focus article because cuz key focus definition sideshow question whether body literally craves nicotine think look much smoking cessation work example give supplements nicotine gum nicotine chewing gum nicotine patches people effort get quit smoking find one thing that nicotine patches gun seem affect someone s desire smoke cigarette impact they re craving words cigarette think that s true conclude smoking complex behavioral process involving people different say may involve different things different people nicotine plays role for people think associated mi pharmacology we ve talked taste feel look jed roses work duke university see that s important component whether people enjoy cigarette smoke they ve achieved sociological behavioral aspects totally apart chemistry combined package think accurately defined habit well let ask behavioral scientist studies we ve looked show much people want quit smoking say want quit smoking can t quit saying people lying whether want quit enough know think they re lying know difficulty differentiating can t quit quit obviously smokers made feel like second class citizens easy answer yes wish could can t think they re sort fudging question whether really well think think know ask like like banana split calories fat would help slim answer obviously yes but underneath taste like banana split feel like banana split make feel good like eat banana split think that s they re saying maybe maybe they re saying want quit still want attendant benefits smoking mi pharmacology relaxed straight seishin stress reduction ability concentrate kinds things behavioral standpoint people want quit lot difficulty said figures i ve seen people report simple willpower plus percent successfully quit mean people difficult time habit enjoyable habit pleasure try stop something enjoy yes going miss yes they ll tendency want maybe difficult change fundamental habit behavior that s well ingrained life behaviorally speaking physically speaking that s opinion yes talking somebody recently backhoe industry person apparently said relating effects tobacco whether there s area functions person asked question would rather pilot who stoked heroin cocaine one smoked cigarette question probably answered rather quickly well people posed question article well talked jack henning field know field studies looked studies said pilot never smoked cigarette smoked flew missed runway think that think studies ever done would say talking effects smoking cigarette smoke nicotine smokers gave give someone naive person excess amount nicotine person someone smoker experienced nicotine give easy give much interfere performance because given toxic amount first time person smokes sometimes debilitating right think debilitating sometimes get certainly negative negative feelings probably learned much much really speaks common sense approach know posed question would plane would rather someone shooting illicit drug someone cup coffee smoking cigarette think common sense tells us would rather plane somebody smoking cigarette cup coffee rather someone drinking alcohol drugs abuse clear distinction surgeon general maintained latest report would comfortable plane pie taking first cigarette well think pilot s going let s let s try looking the people understanding physical psychological effects standpoint would want plane think that s one let john well think obvious things talking smokers smokers smoking cigarette pilot smoking cigarette first one walker first time smoker experience smoking problem flying airplane think we done surgeon general blurring distinction result runs risk trivializing difference hardcore drugs think that s mistake always held common sense view people smoke cigarettes pleasing sensory experience mild pharmacology there s reason die that s that s that s fact people find enjoyable derive benefits report reduces stress increases ability concentrate especially monotonous tasks like flying airplane know ever cockpit airplane used courier would sit cockpit that s monotonous task flying airplane pilots drink coffee they re flying recently smoke cigarettes think pilots know that s benefit derive coffee smoking cigarettes okay let get onto back article interesting one say nicotine stimulatory calming effects rjr first discovered know jr s discovered that s literature years that s so called nicotine paradox first person i m familiar dr gilbert reference article points instances nicotine seems that s paradox we ve discussed seems able lift concentration ability remain attentive keep alert yet people even interestingly people different circumstances report nicotine has stress reduction calming effect we ve demonstrated said laboratory laboratories old camel add say get lift camel say know talk energizing effect camel cigarette let finish talking research i m think i m talking scientifically measured think referred camel sort like would say get lift cup coffee consider thing i m looking scientifically definable constructs known long time lift factor said dr gilbert published article believe think references articles so paradox discussed new discovery particularly whether believe nicotine addictive state specific effects body correct way well say smoker satisfaction mild pharmacology benefits see behaviorally speaking ability reduce stress improve concentration kind short term memory scientifically measurable things stimulate call yes question trying get rj reynolds believes stimulate akan kong pharmacological effect cigarettes regulated fda think falls category drink coffee coffee natural substance people like use smoking falls category historically regulated way substances think dr rose hi agree i m problem the there s specific said effects there s mild pharmacology different people report different results people report sometimes helps calm sometimes helps concentrate think mild effects know there s anything got robinson studies surprised see smokers absorb naked team know number we ve seen numbers people called chippers smoke quite infrequent that s interest researchers time think that s good point glad gradual mentioned belief the smoking obtain nicotine think naive naive point view well one things stalkers would acknowledge correct acknowledge article role play role people yes talk lot sales literature smoker satisfaction right anything sales literature i ve seen maybe could answer question locus has action big party write enjoyment yes want bring customers right well think business providing product people choose use choose send choose provide product they re demanding there s demand cigarettes demand people derive benefits using products think dr robinson s describe benefits part demand is nicotine believe man pleasure enjoyment derived smoking know try sell cigarettes vegetable manhattan material that s done past people interested cigarettes nicotine cigarettes negatives nicotine one prime factors providing call smokers satisfaction think dr robinson has clearly pointed nicotine mild pharmacology associated smoking tobacco something that s people find enjoyable unlike drinking coffee majority coffee drinkers drink coffee caffeine know there s there s derive pleasure enjoyment also pick benefits drive terms alertness what clear drug providing think clear focusing clear distinction smoking coffee drinking illicit drugs really common sense nicotine list drug clear drug legal smoking legal adult activity like coffee drinking used society long time customers smoke smoke certain benefits smoke drug correct let s let s follow logic feeling smoked certain benefits coffee provide certain benefits heroin provide certain benefits couple certainly drink coffee would think people drink coffee drink drug would think way think mean i m chemist i m i m even behavioral scientist think probably properties caffeine somewhat like drug question orange smokers fact smoking drug think i ve repeated times people smoking pleasing sensory experience mild pharmacology associate smokers evidence we ve reported shows people absorb nicotine know everyone looking mild pharmacology know coffee drinkers lot coffee drinkers choose decaffeinated coffee complex behavior think dr robinson is quite familiar simple answer nicotine drug smokers imbibing nicotine think simple answer clear distinct differences using substances like smoking coffee drinking illicit drugs that s real common sense approach feel strongly well fda defines drug

would good law anymore well if simply law odd indeed constitutional analysis get us place ban cigarette advertising would constitutional seems answer yes go four part test central hudson get rather directly first question courts ask product lawful answer yes advertising advertisement false misleading adding answer course product lawful many us think advertisements somewhat misleading hard say advertisement nothing picture two three attractive people pass ftc s test false misleading would want prong advertisement protected question becomes first asserted add interest ban advertising interest ban advertising cigarettes kill people ban advertising save people s lives surely interest interest saving lives substantial one court required requires interest directly advanced band proponents would undoubtedly say first ban advertising get people stop smoking cigarettes think anybody really believes people smoke cigarettes they ve started see advertisements television radio wherever else see billboards stay stop can t stop choose stop real purpose one that s defensible view prevent people starting smoke particularly stopping people children starting smoke seems provides first amendment basis directly advancing interest saving lives course last part test band must restrictive necessary one would start proposition years congress increasingly ratcheting level warning first packages and since congress mandated warning labels advertisement course ftc quite mild question what s matter seems entirely proper congress make judgment worked warnings completely getting they ve getting variety different things congress congress seems within power decide course question would asked absolute ban restrictive necessary course answer must congress conclude least restrictive means least restrictive means works congress reasonably concludes think could measures work but ought sustain band well efforts made areas pornography restrict availability forbidden advertisement material children blocking two hours day television selling certain places displaying pornography publicly things like difficulty course can t isolate cigarette advertising way children read books magazines newspapers go ballparks watched baseball games big cigarettes advertisements way block children block everyone going effective few media exclusively adults probably advertise cigarettes anyway last thing suppose could envision really ratchet warning labels labels instance suppose said packet advertisement smoking kills instead manufacturer required place skull crossbone would less restrictive protective first amendment sure got something like manufacturers would come say that s even worse making say something believe requiring to spend money that s worse total ban think court would right saying end gone analysis say opponents band saying let s go abolish cigarettes really want save people s lives that s do well suppose many proponents saying know perfectly well chance world congress would we ve lived prohibition living war drugs us start war cigarettes would insanity first order everybody knows defense really defense anything realistic option need police state concerned violations first amendment i d much concerned violations constitutional rights ban cigarette smoking anything else advertisements ought least think constitutional analysis well first thing look cigarette advertisement see virtually informational quality tell anybody anything unlike ads virginia pharmacy case prescription prices prescription drug information lawyer advertising cases mr souder advertised the could represent people kinds shield cases many cases clear useful information available course course court purport pass utility information read first amendment cases see quite clearly court imparting test otherwise describing analysis makes clear psychologically legally importance information factor court takes account benefit impart information importantly benefit listener second thing worth talking asking cigarette advertising goes today companies say spending billions dollars every year prevent people switching brands respectfully suggest that s awfully difficult believe simply make sense smart business people surely smart business people would spend kind money prevent people switching brands send ban advertising would brand switching significant amount they d save billions dollars seem like better way seems pretty obvious they re preventing people switching brands care new cigarette manufacturers coming market preventing marketplace closed really concerned replacing people died cigarette smoking every year there s one source new victims that s young people country i m sure heard ninety percent people start smoking they re start much earlier they re illegal smoke states shirley children age induced seduced images glamour advertisements portray get early i m sure someday access strategy memos advertising agencies cigarette companies would prove everybody recognizes market children market advertising targeted reason that s new people coming children able make mind intelligently way risks benefits smoking adults presumably finally course there s special risk addiction people unable stop smoking well say opponents ban advertising look pasado s case pasado s case went grounds exception statute exception could advertise mainland people advertise natives puerto rico yes true judgment made statute unconstitutional rather less unconstitutional sent makes clear part reason descent concern overly paternalistic views puerto rican guy legislature protecting natives information us folks mainland anything suggest statute much harder defend would ban advertising well may convinced least think rightly wrongly assuming none recent additions supreme court would make difference change result decision posadas clearly ordains affirmance statute would ban advertising cigarettes i ll wrap saying many reasons support constitutionality support policy judgments that also believe real slippery slope would cause end first amendment everybody submit would agree tobacco different every product else kills nearly

likewise find lot young people smoking places like norway ban cigarette ads places like hong kong there s even greater advertising cigarettes find united states electronic bands here ultimately also need recognize people society right reject significance persuasiveness health warnings even accept risk dangerous activities smoke like taste stimulation even lord preserve us image smoking country people right collateral right learn advertisements others fact support decision final prong central hudson test think also relevant ban least restrictive way fact narrowly tailored meet kind need recent case commercial speech asks think think even close think united states government done much much could convince people using persuasion scientific evidence smoking bad band alan morrison talking extreme remedy articulated problem there s article gideon door publication called regulation published back talks smoking increased television advertising cigarettes banned makes interesting point one obvious writes advertising electronic media banned expected decrease smoking assumption commercials induced people particularly young people take habit says expectation met indeed cigarette consumption declining began increase well number public service announcements smoking reduced subsequently major factor contributing decreased cigarette consumption removed think the occurrence laws also suggested surgeon general report said anti smoking psas public service announcements retarded per capita cigarette consumption far cigarette ads boosted therefore sound reasons think ban think band interject government censorship business fact bands even work i d like say one thing realize ban alan morrison says upheld posadas case involves casino gambling puerto rico peculiar form ban think bands think elimination public view something completely that s ban well band mickey mouse elephant band go puerto rico today going see plenty casino advertising restriction upheld court restriction advertisements directed residents puerto rico practical matter residents puerto rico main reading media seeing flyers newspapers handouts tourists see practical banning effect basis regulation speech a time place manner restriction band think unfortunate people talk posadas less care alan assume bans mean thing mean common parlance characterize constitutional arguments policy arguments little bit think ultimately question fundamental fairness take society information animation advertising speech tobacco interests advertisers know debate smoking health continued continue without band suggested continue without one remember vigor debate past brooke shields remember posters stuck cigarettes ears demonstrate cigarettes made people attractive groups distributing stickers say things like kissing smoker like licking ashtray d artists add tobacconist slogan alive pleasure words dead cancer free speech speech contributing debate contributing debate without involving united states government censoring information regard long run successful way communicate opposition smoking tobacco thank you thank mr lin minutes i d like divide time give gentlemen five minutes exchange whatever questions challenges know inadequate time also want make sure audience chance ask questions give us much time mrs took much time time opening speech i ll make reply remarks short one search pasado s opinion vain hint time place manner restriction surely inconsistent logic chief justice s opinion that s time place manner restriction quote friend burial mickey mouse elephant second listened carefully think barry said information been conveyed audience s ads yet fail understand point information talking price availability tar nicotine content perhaps know seen informational ads i ve seen lots image ads i ve seen lots kinds ads information least matter policy ought say are conveying information hard understand ads necessary finally i d like say word studies surveys statistics wiser man said statistician person draws mechanically precise line unwarranted assumption foregone conclusion seems statistics cited precisely category i messages result ban advertising cigarette products norway children smoking result ban advertising cigarettes radio television people smoking united states conclude tobacco industry ought favor ban advertising boost sales conclusion seems possible suggest that correct premise drawn tobacco industry thought ban advertising would boost sales would see supporting legislation thank you thank mr morrison mr lin absence public service announcements argument nobody suggesting ban product advertising people use i m simply explaining sister districts think alan knows credible evidence countries ban advertisements negative effect consumption product different normal reduction consumption going parts world today people understand smoking good logic posadas decision i ll stand said think time place manner band chief justice united states supreme court regard sees differently say answer justice rehnquist almost subject one personally would hold high regard would surprised alan morrison either warnings said get through ooh well guess warnings know tell people things anyway people always choose believe things government tells right thank goodness regards even believe warnings may believe there s higher value higher personal individual interest part smoking listening health claims surgeon general would last one final point there s informational quality allen says well theirs case there s price there s tar nicotine content there s question whether filtered yes there s even surgeon general s warning dangerous product allen says that s information hear time i ve even heard people say there s informational content debbie dallas want ban reason old argument fact hear alan morrison talk realize thing everybody else s argument something ought banned know alan morrison wants ban ads toys involving teenage mutant ninja turtles know wants ban ads alcohol sugared cereal guarantee someone like alan morrison know want ban advertisements they ve got adherence coterie supporters make argument there s something peculiarly dangerous products government ought step in tell thing i d say alan morrison thanks thank you mr morrison first question please would ban cigarette advertising include things sponsorship sporting events cigarette companies example virginia slims tennis tournament would band impact television programming example smoking movies forth tv shows would matter policy say tournament could longer named virginia slims care seems entitled put name something like put name outside plant make virginia slims bother much far television concerned certainly think ought carry existing band television allowing marlboro strategically place ads centerfield knowing cameras going shoot behind catcher spend time focusing marlboro time they re focusing pitcher answer whole thing yes think mr lin question say evidence ban effective canadian band contributed impressive decline smoking amongst population especially population age well think short lived nature canadian band yet demonstrate kind statistics going demonstrate whether really work remember countries have longer term evidence decline even see appears statistically significant alteration first months one disappears life ban think there s credible long term evidence banning tobacco advertisements nation going effective reducing consumption even among children want comment mr morris well here s another question deals partially question canada court spent months reviewing question whether cigarette ads cause consumption concluding evidence connection well read opinion say skimmed largely irrelevant think would us today would also point i m familiar system judicial review canada country courts would make determination would legislature courts would review standard which every legislature must reasonable basis actually look evidence congress issue compared evidence that s legislators issues banning took place state courts enormously restrictive lawyer advertising there s essentially evidence causal connection clear impression congress would given great deference court far difference the trial judge canada claims spent year trying case hearing witnesses essentially deciding legislature decided something would never happen country found reasoning unpersuasive event would happen country form suggesting suggesting good thing courts even look facts mean think going find people like well clarence thomas example sitting federal appeals court one exception never overturned agency decision matter basis see rule function higher appellate courts think dangerous therefore assume ultimately issue ought decided courts decided congress looks evidence sees first time someone s talked banning words advertisements images reject hold higher standard the banning something like lawn dart involves speech lawn darts denied hoping talk clarence thomas nomination today think i ll respond last remark one last question mr barry lynn believe cigarette companies truly interested claim recruiting new smokers attractive advertising even though company s moves customers day due death quitting think tobacco companies choose right try enlist people use product think there s difference therefore every single other act service part american commercial advertising think right think goal intentionally lure children smoking cigarettes one fascinating things found every time backhoe company tries enlist public kind campaign stop young people using cigarettes anti smoking groups first ones door saying phony work won t cooperate consequence think good educational programs simply get taken seriously critics smoking clear believe there s kind hidden agenda even pay attention quality ideas suggestions come tobacco companies mr marzen one last word i ve yet see quality ideas quitting smoking comfort back companies case made would join thank distinguished speakers

AV CODE.",0:13:26,hello doug sarah mcclurkin think time program talked know one cigarette advertising promotion code that s right pull crew together meet map out hm thursday that s fine good i ll see bye bye i m glad could make today need find way present cigarette advertising promotion code broad audience know brand marketing field marketing ad agencies sampling contractors right everybody that s involved creation execution cigarette advertising promotion read code think pretty tough subject cover comprehensive covers advertising point sale promotion ariel s sampling practices right comprehensive codes updated important everyone know new ground rules everyone realized code set guidelines govern way want intend business saying code something trying beat really set standards industry wants meet that s right get point across well first need give background like fact the backhoe industry voluntary advertising code since think need go beyond well talk even code code trying also need tell people important changes code like advertising cigarettes billboard s within feet schools playgrounds think that s good example code tries want children smoke want add swear they re present large numbers make sure appealing children code says mail cigarette samples cigarette logoed premium items anyone signed written certification already smoked they re least years old lot rules sampling direct marketing right instance can t give samples public streets sidewalks parks unless area that s open people legally buy practice rope area restricted mission older also something people phoning cigarette samples yes sure code says cannot distribute way know stuff important guidelines complex detailed something make sure people suppliers get point okay shooting video tape could start roleplay pay show steps go qualify smokers smoker years age may please see identification hope enjoy shirt yeah really see working need make point give away clothing adult sizes interpret mean adult size large extra large adults small medium well good job okay okay we ve covered qualifying smokers age else need talk think need talk claims pay put products cigarette ads popular movies think people need know that s covered code need know code spells specific guidelines govern develop cigarette ads well take ad example models least look least old code says show it anyone well known athlete smoker can t use testimonials sports figures celebrities actually anyone else special appeal anyone who s people look healthy attractive violate code that s fine okay long there s suggestion look good they re healthy smoke ads show people ceiling bowling physical activity no problem fine long activity require athletic abilities special stamina would beyond need normal recreation know want show marathon runner standing finish line smoke serious stuff knows there s something lighten sure let s talk sex sewer sex advertising major claim cigarette companies yeah code deals fact says let quote cigarette advertising shall suggest smoking essential social prominence distinction success sexual attraction shall picture person smoking exaggerated manner saying our ads imply smoking cigarette make rich famous help get date that s right need make points know code long contains lot detailed information well never able get video well video one way let people know set standards follow we ve changed code made stronger yeah one point need to make advertising though cigarette ads cannot appear publications directed primarily years age like teen write young miss also includes school college university medium well hold sarah i m confused lot people attend colleges universities yes that s good point code prohibits type advertising because college publications likely read people let s go back sampling need cover detail company already videotape called sampling way fact brought copy let show clip great tell paul what s important thing sampler procedures important must followed screen probably important procedure anyone given cigarette sample must screened smoker old sampler find asking screening questions always ask hi smoker even they re smoking come us still ask give samples smokers two people older always ask age experiences taught us older people resent asked age smokers obviously give authorized number samples hi smoker yes enjoy camel thank smoker obviously asked date born date qualifies smoker years age older always provided market manager sarah sees video well show sampling contractors employees well looks like enough video go lunch course okay copies code see rules pretty straightforward couple points would like make first even code industry interested making sure marketing products legal ethical manner interested trying appeal anyone already smoked interested marketing products anyone who s age million american adults already choose smoke get current chair smokers jobs code helps us effectively market products smokers without appealing groups questions what s code regarding certifications really get code provides send samples promotional items bearing brand logos mail except persons first provided us sign certifications older smoker want receive samples premiums get certifications everyone send samples premiums fact implemented company practice well came part industry code well want communicating children non smokers people want sending things wastes time promotional dollars certification practice reasonable step avoid communicating inappropriate persons except liars cheaters effective judges whether model ad looks least years old that s tough one code provides model shall years age look get older older everyone else looks younger younger right seriously age someone looks really matter judgment trying appeal children people

COMMERCIAL PROJECT KITCHEN SHOW 2,0:10:42,imagine cigarette smoke disappears like smells like imagine cigarette leaves ashes leave windows clear introducing eclipsed vantage cigarette reduces secondhand smoke hi i m mark elliott i m carol maze part team introducing clips around country we d like take minutes tell sounds impossible cigarette smoke that s defying full bodied leaves odor stains practically secondhand smoke say little skeptical first look smoke carol exhales see fast disappears next time smoke cigarettes see long takes smoke disappear look there s virtually smoke lid end mean really try believe work oh pretty simple idea eclipse primarily heats tobacco instead of turning inside look different way works makes big difference smoke eclipse made much like cigarette got something special tip made high purity carbon tip wrapped insulating heat barrier keeps eclipse burning tobacco burn rest cigarette blend fine tobacco s followed regular cigarette filter light lighting carbon tip take extra puff longer draw use good flame car lighter work well lit carbon tip gets hot stays hot eclipse done smoke eclipse heat barrier keeps tobacco burning inside cigarette instead warm air passes tobacco getting hot enough create full bodied smoke carries flavor tobacco it since burn eclipse smoke coming lid end there s nothing added tobacco another cigarettes smoke different right mark right eclipse take common tobacco smoke well turn upside smoke particles cigarettes twenty percent water glycerin eclipse smoke reverse water glycerin something found all red smoke well many food products baked goods let s get brass tacks mark tar nicotine numbers exactly well carol let s take look full flavor cigarette styles milligrams tar light styles ultra light cigarettes typically one six milligrams eclipse primarily heats rather burns tobacco three milligrams tar full flavor style one mild style know carol tar levels come methods measure tar cigarettes burnt tobacco since eclipse primarily heats rather births tobacco sort like comparing apples oranges that s right fact methods glycerin eclipse recorded tar include glycerin eclipse would level even less milligram nicotine full flavor cigarettes typically contain point eight one point seven milligrams nicotine lights range ultralights range point point five eclipse milligrams nicotine full flavor style mild style clips smoke mostly water glycerin smoother taste disappears fast kind like breath cold winter s morning exactly smoke combined fact there s smoke lid end gives eclipse percent reduction secondhand smoke right know way eclipse works something like making coffee pour hot water flavors release grounds grounds still finished flavor gone throw away finished eclipse really notice difference smoking smoke build room confident smoke stains build walls windows curtains even teeth takes notice eclipse stain build here s way see difference right mark s going exhale smoke leading light cigarette curtain fabric notice result he ll clips take look difference here s another thing eclipses that s pretty amazing would pass asteroid carol eclipse burn leave ashes put tip keeps burning slowly look cigarette somehow falls ashtray lie flat table without burning fact eclipse much less likely start fire cigarettes careful tip still hot tip burns long cigarette six seven minutes oh get number puffs regular brand eclipse goes start getting less smoke taste gets weaker that s tell eclipse finished we ve enjoyed cigarettes smell coffee great everyone comes room really know difference we ve talking long enough right mark well there s still lot cliff hey far know eclipse introduced people country lots people questions incredible new cigarette probably going answer questions light smoked light mean can t pick smoke right could relate eclipse much would come smoked flavors gone tobacco heat barrier barrier insulating mat made spun glass smoke eclipse heat barrier burn add anything smoke keep tobacco burning produce smoke lid end also reason eclipse less likely cigarettes start fire what s carbon tip like charcoal used grill carbon used heat tip much higher purity charcoal use grill question yes carbon tip make like carbon monoxide cigarette does fact carbon monoxide eclipse comparable less light cigarettes cigarette anything that s worse cigarettes there s nothing added tobacco find another cigarettes there s nothing smoke eclipse that s worse anything get ordinary smoke eclipse going cost conventional regular cigarettes way made eclipse cost produce cigarettes however it ll cost full price brand like winston marlboro let s hear people america chance try eclipse see benefits believe absolutely could believe fact tasted good expected pretty much thing would look like cigarette worked probably taste good full flavored anything like would lot of drawbacks pretty surprised well i d say personally key benefit clips lack mess that s associated cigarettes occasionally go bedroom something change i ll cigarette next thing know clothes smell like cigarette smoke eclipse can t tell even bedroom smoking qualms smoking the inside house visible know smoke anywhere smell clean kind cigarette can t see reason smoker switch eclipse think everyone smoked eclipse smokers non smokers would probably get along lot better ever thanks joining

tell sounds impossible cigarette smoke that s satisfying full bodied leaves odor stains practically secondhand smoke say little skeptical first look smoke carol exhales see fast disappears next time smoke your guerette see long takes smoke disappear look there s virtually smoke lid end mean really try believe work oh pretty simple idea eclipse primarily heats tobacco instead burning inside look different way works makes big difference smoke eclipse made much like cigarette got something special tip made high purity carbon tip wrapped insulating heat barrier keeps eclipse burning tobacco burn rest cigarette blend fine tobacco s followed regular cigarette filter light lighting carbon tip take extra puff longer draw use good flame car lighter work well lit carbon tip gets hot stays hot eclipse done smoke eclipse heat barrier keeps tobacco burning inside cigarette instead warm air passes tobacco getting hot enough create full bodied smoke carries flavor tobacco it since burn eclipse

release the rounds grounds still finished flavor gone throw away finished eclipse really notice difference smoking smoke build room confident smoke stains build walls windows curtains even teeth takes notice eclipse stain build here s way see difference right mark s going exhale smoke leading light cigarette curtain fabric notice result he ll eclipse take look difference here s another thing eclipses that s pretty amazing would pass story carol eclipse burn leave ashes put tip keeps burning slowly look cigarette somehow falls ashtray lie flat table without burning fact eclipse much less likely start fire cigarettes careful tip still hot tip burns long cigarette six seven minutes oh get number puffs regular brand eclipse goes start getting less smoke taste gets weaker that s tell eclipse finished we ve enjoyed cigarettes smell coffee great everyone comes room really know difference we ve talking long enough right well there s still lot clips let s hear people america chance try clips see benefits eclipse would either taste like absolutely nothing would taste really bad burn like normal cigarette burns laughter eclipse two three know kind surprised actually tastes like cigarette expected salesman i m know road car day long smoking eclipse know cut stain windows smell clothes hair dealing public that s something nowadays worry friend walk with either drive church dressed church smoke car says can t tell smoking can t smell personally key benefit clips lack mess that s associated cigarettes there s ashes clean house windows house car haze clean much like that occasionally go bedroom something change i ll cigarette next thing know clothes smell like cigarette smoke eclipse can t tell even bedroom what s eclipse great could still dishes stuff burning cigarette burning face ashes dropping food laundry i m folding qualms smoking eclipse inside house because visible know smoke anywhere smell clean kind cigarette can t see reason smoker switch eclipse

style corresponds currently smoke later try one sort funny things sometimes find full flavor smokers actually like miles better vice versa eclipse we ll give chance try want right take look cigarette remember said video tape use lighter use good flame hold flame cigarette little bit longer kick extra puffer know cigarette going start exhaling smoke look tip glowing red go ahead light up might see little bit ash first slide that s paper end flaking end use cigarette lighters recommend car lighter recommend car lighters get hot enough order get started either match lighter expected really like good mama lives excellent excellent flavor like better cigarette keep wanting flip thing think that d problem getting used flicking going feel funny throw whole cigarette away though question asked room going what s going like whole cigarette left going throw away litter perhaps back put back pack jim said something found people switched cigarette they re fact less likely throw window this thing that s left go ahead simply dispose thing people tell us happens cigarettes left ashtray like ask question take look two ashtrays one would rather empty one cigarette butts ash left one finished simply take cigarettes there s ash ashtray and going throw away trash interested seeing looks like inside dorothy let cigarette go ahead cut open actually hollowed out cylinder think s inside would say backhoe come okay bedding going inside cigarette earlier cook tobacco ashes tobacco remember hold there s tobacco like residue coffee that s right exactly sometimes people ask us take tobacco re roll light smoke it answer want keep mind smoked clips extracted flavor really taste good anymore using tea bag third fourth time taste good made lot claims benefits eclipse said dramatic reduction secondhand smoke odors stains ashes think seen experienced eclipse lives claims made good skeptical came know trying cigarette thought gonna like light ultra light type like smoking i m smoke marlboro lights jesus probably years would switch i m real happy fact could smoke house stain windows curtains waffles pretty exciting i ve smoking garage long time definitely switch wife would praise cigarettes ends earth tired smoke smell dirt air everything else she d love like idea set burn furniture know pretty much flame retardant want get home try significant right pretty surprised still pretty surprised wondering one would taste i d like another i m glad hear everybody liked experience thought something could switch tell lot people we ve talked awful lot many people have i ve switched cigarette type things tell us maybe smoking lights used smoke full flavor cigarette transition eclipse much like maybe first cigarette two might first pack two three packs like product make switch overnight usually take good cut adjust different type cigarette want go lower higher type trade off you going make smoked marlboro s years would something i d switch well i m hoping get hold dearest friend like smoke home tell love one cigarettes around could see pleasant would aggravated thanks everybody let see show hands many people would could go buy cliffs today excellent good thank thank very much coming today trying eclipse pics thank appreciate i m glad enjoyed it cigarette believe everything telling us true smoked expected pretty much thing would look like cigarette worked

xzgb0039,This is a questioning of an EPA offical about the study saying that cigarettes is a marker for certain behavior and asthma levels.,tobacco; cigarette; report; conference; study,"CATO CONFERENCE, THE POLITICS OF TOBACCO. TOBACCO USE, POLITICS & SOCIETY",0:29:35,turned percentage children develop asthma significantly higher women smoked least ten cigarettes per day significant women less tenth grade education pot dunno i d i ll look report find whether risk totally disappeared almost statistically nonsignificant kids whose parents greater high school education look you fact think sent study that s raised question of smoking marker behavior lifestyle may well there s certainly socio economic strata true chronic lung diseases including extent asthma reaction causing asthma due house dust suspect somebody years education higher socioeconomic status probably less half house dust house someone lord make life addictive song question primarily dr baird although i d welcome dr huber comment well extrapolating epidemiological data population estimates epa relied heavily cotinine measure exposure ets pointed presentation i m wondering first respond dr huber s point that nicotine therefore cotinine seem representative exposure elements ets also people samples measures taken representative general population reason believe representative general population finally would evaluate important dietary sources nicotine get potatoes green peppers think tomatoes well important population estimates take account last one think answer first time get first one think repeat took account dietary sources discounted analysis suggested dietary sources could add much company people would expose even people said exposed either one the one whether group people cotinine measures taken representative population reason believe believe representative population think best say tried use cotinine studies u s could find take coating studies foreign countries sense reason believe representative sample think volunteers reason believe representative sample either next question think first question was believe nicotine valid measure exposure environmental tobacco smoke visa vie dr huber said nicotine hits wall sticks curtains analysis remembered i m going swear show nicotine one quickly adheres lot furniture cloth material well particular phase remembered environmental tobacco smoke right that s vapor phase thanks appears upholstery well actually comes year quickly lot components environmental tobacco smoke however use nicotine compare the exposures non smokers non smokers people exposed fossil smoke people would exposed fossil smoke felt ratio levels came anywhere two three two one that s close enough there s whole bunch extrapolation me respond think think current studies oakridge underway put end discussion tell us what s environment exposed nicotine terrible marker everything true basically unique tobacco may get trace amounts things basically unique tobacco that s good marker even active smoking good marker environmental exposures anything nicotine vapor that s measured track constituents get environment that s oakridge investigators using something else also emphasizes fallacy much thinking cannot extrapolate whole cigarette active smoker constituents inhale environment that norman sharp i d like thank much excellent presentations two questions one never statistics school i m looking exposure level means there s really significant risks risk nonsmoker see see came one point one nine report things things really begin statistically significant always thought got level things really owners went went second question studies come conclusions epa updating report relative risks pooled relative risk forever versus never us look higher levels exposure average comes hold tear range higher levels exposure classical epidemiologist always looked exposure occupational chemicals high levels exposure therapeutic levels came lower relative risks said well lot explained way sure conclusions high exposures deal totality evidence think high think risk lung cancer non smokers general high evidence says dose response trends highest exposure groups showing effects supporting evidence conclusion hazard there use use different study estimate total risk population total risk population said high increased risk environmental tobacco smoke turns everyday life exposed it multiply total number non smokers population going get three thousand even small risks x large numbers come epa might consider consider significant number answer think come back question terribly high that s estimate spousal adjust total estimate gets bit higher willie pab next question epa updating report know jennifer continue work one seems encouraging us one seems discouraging us think there s whole bunch funds available environmental tobacco smoke i ve seen right administrative let know think can t get talk her become doctor small risk agree there s couple interesting things look studies historically meta analyses sequentially number keeps coming lower lower that s think studies get better control confounding include studies maybe risk instead something like presented data too national ethics conference use numbers presented paper pizza fumes nobody thought consideration risk could probably kind exposure level kind risk nobody concerned said bad guy smoke everybody concerned really talked different way and dr baird emphasizes need totality evidence would agree can t use totality evidence active whole smoke inhalation environmental tobacco smoke must judge merits thank much next discussion economics tobacco use jane gravel congressional research service jacob selim national review debate issue exchange runs hour next speaker jane gravelle senior specialist economics congressional research service jane sparred occasion usually tax treatment capital income united states fine fine public finance economist worked labor department treasury department taught boston university one widely regarded fiscal economist s town jane will address social economic issues affecting use tobacco country okay thank see get microphone right said okay let begin saying views present today views congressional research service necessarily views congressional research service although talking largely about crs report written back march entitled cigarette taxes fund health care reform economic analysis that s got issue sometimes great regret administration proposed fairly substantial increase cigarette tax one methods funding health care reform legislation congress that s how colleague dennis zimmerman came write paper tobacco taxes cigarette taxes lot things paper probably might less interested lots complicated estimates revenue yield time things part paper i d like talk issue justifications increasing cigarette tax i m economist do new research perspective economist found perspective different perhaps perspective public health community sketch briefly though starting presumption people sets subjective preferences like spend money general want allow enjoy resources lifetime resources accord preferences would intervene decisions certain kinds circumstances try money measure first one circumstances possibility spillover effects smoking i m talking spell effects i m going talking primarily secondhand smoke rather another kind potential spillover effect financial spillover cost smoking occur insurance systems social insurance systems medical insurance systems grouped single premium paid differentiate normally premiums respect whether smoke not wanted look try measure magnitude spillover effects financial spillover effects compare existing level cigarette taxes answer whether increase cigarette tax justified kind increase might justified based financial effects went look issue surprised find really one study really kind of conceptually appropriate framework could give measure efficient level cigarette tax economists tend talk efficiency means buy pack cigarettes pay price cigarettes also implicit costs know assuming aware health effects might also another part cost pay borne someone else that s cost smokers impose people kinds costs trying look at well found looked study study done health economist named ray manning several associates associates funded rand corporation certainly far could tell appropriately properly done study conceptual framework study done back night price levels change prices reflect love inflating medical cost medical services price index costs general price level increase found measure spillover effects per pack cigarettes cents that s central estimate i m going talk minute there s always problems always problems statistical estimates i m going talk minute problems time the get tax last numbers could measure current cigarette tax sum federal state local taxes cent s little cent s probably little higher measures cigarette tax already higher existing spillover cost let tell briefly spillover cost tail first increased health cost smokers occur earlier life of smokers accounted forty nine cents pack also another one sent pack excess sick leave cost smokers relative non smokers seven cents excess life insurance premiums three cents far insurance premiums cents foregoing taxes paid social retirement programs like social security medicare premature death however also offsetting effects way costs imposed people they re anything smoker would pay pocket co payment insurance health insurance account cents born people society overall however there s also savings occur mainly smokers die earlier died earlier they re actually external savings occur include medical cost actually net cost smoking related deaths less illnesses get later life died earlier there s also savings six cent per pack nursing home costs cents per pack reduce social security benefits unimportant thing rand study put estimates lifetime framework recognized first smoke pay taxes might illness would next time would savings due premature death let stop say right nobody saying premature death benefit society mean people misunderstand clearly premature death cost smoke cost smokers families cost people know smokers part society certainly cost society smoker buying pack cigarettes presuming aware aware house arrest cost us already taken account cost premature death counted can t counted kind sensible analysis spillover effect financial cost anybody else i d like kind put numbers perspective i d like take moment contrast recent numbers put cdc think think back june released us estimates said health related cost smoking to billion dollars year took least someone cdc took billion dollars divide number packs cigarettes smoked came two dollars six cents pack course immediately people said two dollars six cents cents use example explain important think right conceptual terms billion dollars year much medical star they re smoking that s true alternative dying smoking related disease perfect health eternal life may sure sure lot things one thing pretty sure well gonna die going another kind health related seize might even cost occur later time might cost more billion dollar number netted actually asking much smoking sharp medical bill cost paying people who ve already died know sounds crass cold hearted that s way looking numbers looking costs that s way another thing cdc number translate two dollars six cents pack mrs time related nature smoking illness lifetime effects occur including lot smoking lot taxes collected first cost took cdc numbers divide number packs cigarettes smoked got real problem medical costs due people smoking today they re largely due people smoking past way suddenly took cut cigarette consumption half sudden costs would go two dollars six cents four dollars twelve cents nothing real changed found way something caused cigarette smoking double cost back dollar three cents numbers really mean much context proper measure cigarette tax compensate spillover benefits even could take account things like social security forth fact think nobody s ever done kinds estimates seems quite possible health bill might actually smaller today probably medicare bill might smaller people mostly might savings things spending cost customer smoking would last person one say cents precise number there s lots lots potential problems kinds statistical estimates looked paper lots different kinds factors might make price go go i ll one called model specification errors example estimates based people s recall medical expenditures recall particular recall might understated number might little bit higher sensitivity test done try use different survey go little bit higher great deal probably serious model specification problem study included illnesses rather illnesses thought related smoking since know smokers tend live risky lives general non smokers possibility failure control lifestyle attributes exaggerated numbers made actually larger correct could end actually smoking actually benefit least much least much smaller cost get effects discount rate used discount rate raise discount rate get cents of pack lowered disappears quickly little sudden got zero discount late rate lower give actually financial positive financial benefit smoking looked characters issues also look passive smoking i ll know heard lots lots passive smoking already morning tell talked passive smoking looking efficient cigarette tax first felt evidence somewhat uncertain that s small small risk effect because new study new large study came overall show effect also saw lot specification problems think i d completely resolved one confounders talked one thought problem miss classification error epa people correct classification error really know they re correction big enough kind interesting corrections risk use cancer ex smokers misclassified actually lower passive smoking risk know little problems things know can t sure corrected course particularly start talking trend estimates potential problem think recall bias possibility people cancer going give different subjective answer exposure people economist i m deeply suspicious survey responses know go surveys things like consumer spending income know get bad answers know people good recall lot things first comment made passive smoking think somewhat evidence risk sister somewhat small also thought were really would want use tax correct case extent effects occur within families economist would normally think spillover effect particularly wives wives usually knew married husbands smoked wives least hope ability negotiate terms living they re concerned exposure smoke argument attacks spillover effect passive smoking weak think lot effects occur within families go back people recognizing cost people recognize there s cost assuming caring family they re going cognizant costs make decision efficiency that s important thing matters last reason actually calculated pact effect passive smoking two ways use epa numbers extrapolated active smoking illnesses come large amounts mean sort maximum amount would come even included high cost lost life cents probably good bit smaller also tried extrapolate mom although i ve heard two people tell absolutely can t nevertheless try extrapolate extrapolation kota name levels average levels population half percent makes smaller kind extrapolation extrapolating epa data obviously get smaller numbers cents pack none really large enough make case raising cigarette attacks spillover grounds

well let tell let talk car see see circle right whatever coming carbon filter included pie chart okay everything burning smoldering carbon steam created tobacco way filter kit contained nothing cigarettes either water glycerin well water glycerin coming tobacco pulling heat across okay still small amounts tar result saw little bit charring tobacco one smoked whatever vapor particles produced cigarette also present cigarettes except much much lower reduced level like percent less heating rather burning hope answered question burning little carbon heat source would adding anything smoke whole lot less burning tobacco order like smoker order get little heat go little tip going hold flame little bit longer okay see see light take two seconds opposed half second okay smoke cigarette also burn ashes smoke cigarette see there s lid smog okay carry around smell smell little bit little bit smell lot lit i d like okay i ll block tell feel really think would like regular cigarette okay
