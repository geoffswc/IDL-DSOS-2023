groups are using scientifically unproven ETS claims to create health concerns in non-smokers, the tobacco industry as a whole has not previously been convinced of the urgency and manner with which the issue of ETS should be dealt however it is becoming more apparent that growing concerns about ETS must be addressed and this can only be achieved through coordinated campaign action, a clear strategy and a proactive program are essential for a successful campaign, to help you info tab has produced a new product seizing the initiative it has been carefully researched and tested with a selection of the industry worldwide and contains the most up-to-date material, the product seizing the initiative consists of a number of different documents which together form the elements of an ETS action plan, the central strategy document a brief guide, sectoral guides for the workplace measure, public transport, and Airlines, to Scientific guides, sample press statements, and finally a small document called benefits of hindsight which is a selection of hints from National manufacturers associations nma is following their campaign experience, the central strategy document is at the core of the product and contains the statement of strategic intent the initial goal is to establish both a credibility and acceptance of balanced scientific evidence presented by the industry on the issue of ETS, That Base must be established before countering specific restrictions, it also explains the need for proactive campaigns and their benefits and outlines the three main elements of the strategy attitude research public campaigns and targeted campaigns, turning them to attitude research, before any campaign it's essential to measure the current Planet such things as attitude perception and beliefs will all play a part in how people perceive ETS, it's also important to identify the priority level that ETS occupies and how its seen in relation to other issues, all of these would of course vary with different audiences and so we need to classify the separate groups and research and evaluate them individually, key audiences while a matter of local identification will normally fall into three categories, legislators and those who inform and advise them as ultimately governments determine Public Health policies this would include central government ministers and their staff civil servants and local government officials and representatives, then there are those who exert control over smoking policies in the key areas of public transport Leisure and the workplace these would be local management and in the case of large National and Multinational organizations they would include head office policy-making departments such as Personnel departments, in some countries there are regulatory bodies and advisory groups who give advice and offer recommendations on policy decisions, and last but by no means least the General Public, the information gained from the research can then be used in public and targeted campaigns to address those specific concerns identified from each of those audiences, turning to public campaigns, the role of the public campaign is to establish communication with the general public and impart the key industry propositions the tobacco industry has a case that needs to be heard and the public must be made aware of the full debate, the industry's case is centered upon fact and is genuinely concerned with the results of scientific investigation ETS is not a scientifically proven cause of disease in non-smokers nor is it a significant factor in indoor air quality, however the industry does recognize that some people find ETS annoying in certain circumstances and therefore tolerance and courtesy have become key features of the public campaign, there is nothing new about people finding the behaviors of others annoying the world is full of petty annoyances where different people live and work together, Society depends on Mutual consideration and most of us resolve our daily differences in a spirit of courtesy and accommodation, these same principles must apply between smokers and non-smokers with mutual respect and tolerance where personal choices and preferences differ, to help you design a public campaign seizing the initiative provides a number of sample guides press statements and an options menu of various supporting activities, of the guides the brief guide explains ETS in a manner that is clear concise and easy to read it is particularly suitable for use as a direct mailing, this is complemented by two scientific guides which discuss the issue of ETS in a more detailed manner, the first explores and debates the impact of ETS on indoor air quality, the second is a detailed review of the reports and studies which discuss alleged health effects from ETS, in a campaign it's important that a full range of activities is used to support the public campaign and accordingly an options menu has been included with the public campaign section of the strategies document to enable self selection of various advertising and public relations activities, it's in this section that the more active elements are contained, certainly the test Market audience expressed a need to carry out Communications in every available medium especially the spoken word, they also emphasized the potential role of the media in influencing how much of the ETS debate was publicized hence the inclusion of the press statements, the public campaign is the Cornerstone of the strategy its success will be reflected in public opinion which is a key influence if further restrictions are to be avoided, finally targeted campaigns, the targeted campaigns are designed to deliver deliberately and systematically the relevant arguments to specialist sectoral areas the scientific basis having been first established in the public campaign, the sector's covered by the guides are public transport Airlines Leisure and workplace, each specialist guide can also be combined with the brief and scientific guides together they form a comprehensive corporate information pack, also within the targeted campaign section is an options menu of various other activities which will add to the reach of the campaign, at this stage you will probably think that enough has been done and that the targeted campaign is the final element not so, what seizing the initiative is advocating is a continuous process of evaluation through attitude research followed by the planning and execution of public and targeted campaign action, so finally how can seizing the initiative be used within your Market with its different laws cultures languages and beliefs impacting upon how the product is best implemented, first extensive research
