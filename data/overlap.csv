ffhb0039,"even more rare, what we'll do is just start in this is so I can figure out who you guys are going to get home if you could just start by stating your name my name is Theresa I live here in Safety Harbor what what brand of, music once tonight 100's order a light one hundredths okay how long have you been smoking like what's a Winston and that combination that combination probably 15 years more 15 years ago it's always Winston yeah well I started off and I was a kid at foot Carrington's the different ones but when since I've sucked okay we're about to dance my name is Deanna from st. Pete I smoked camel like 100's, I've been smoking them now for about 1215 years he ever switch around between Brands just camel regulars the light and in between us thinking basically camel okay how did you all did you guys come in and go to a group with a lot of other people if both of you haven't okay and then if you remember back then they were talking about what it's like to be a smoker today and kind of how people's attitudes have changed towards smokers, have you personally either one of you notice that practically okay like go ahead and I mean what what is it like to be a smoker and safety today and how has it changed recently not so much in STP but I travel their planes in the days when you could smoke you had to sit in the back of the plane but even now an airport you got to physically leave the airport in order to have a cigarette and you got to go back to security and all the hassles of trying to run for planes and it's true, aggravating and then you got the smoking cars non-smoking cars converted a few what about you Teresa mean what's it like might notice right now you can't smoke them all if you want to smoke we have to let it go outside and if you do smoke anywhere by just looks at you like you have dirt on your face or something you know it's just a bad person has spoken what is just as the reacting to what do you think how secondhand smoke probably, such a big deal with that right now all right that mainly here's the main thing I say also they don't like the owner or the the smoke and paper plane to make its knees or irritates her nose or what have you and they don't like the smell on their clothes I'm curious in either either one of y'all can go go on this one when you first before you got to try this cigarette before you get to the first try of a cliff so you start hearing about it and you were sitting, a group and then what kind of thoughts are going through your mind what we what were you thinking truth yeah I thought was a good idea it's you know smoke for me I'm free I thought I was pretty good idea did you have any did you anticipate anything as far as like what it would taste like or before I try to change my voice right now I just feel you're just interested yeah yeah I just thought the concept was really nice yeah what about you Dan what were you, thinking yeah I think the concepts excellent that it's basically trying to help out the defenseless smokers this point I think like basically turning us into closet smokers from you guys get the comments they don't mind you smoking just don't exhale but I thought it was very unique and a new wave of where the smokers going to go I was concerned about the flavor and it tastes because primarily that's what I like about it, camels I do find a difference between camels Winston's and lights and Ultras and those kind of things that have tried in the past but that was pretty important also what did you think did you have a nice digit guess like what it would taste like no no I I tried both the Menthol and then I'm involved just to try both of them during a class I used to smoke cools years ago the irritated my throat for me back to the non menthols okay, what it all just keep going with you Dan what was it like them that first time I think you got to try them in those groups as what did you think of the startup was tough basically they told us to who's like a cigar and the women fared because they don't know how to smoke too many cigars but you got to really draw a hard to get it going and to me it seemed like I had to draw a hard to keep it going the flavor was different what I kind of turned it back, back to was like like when the Fantage first came out it had a like a twang to it and a little bit of a bite that's probably the only thing that really would be negative on my side would be the flavor leaves a little bit after by kind of like maybe smoking a cigar, okay what about you Teresa what was your I mean when you were in there and you try to hustle well it was awfully hard to life as hard to smoke and a sex machine learning to smoke all over again it was real hard to smoke what did you think about the taste when you finally face them well I normally smells like cigarettes and the light when I try there's no flavor at all because I didn't think that was so I went I could try the full flavor that's a little better, not much not much now now I'm not I like the whole idea but I really do and I hope they can improve on it somehow but it's too hard to smoke you smoke at you just like I'm on a cigarette now I want a real cigarette I feel like I'm playing so in your case is not really satisfying you knocked around by 10 degree I smoked them with my camels and you know I'll tell you the alternating back and forth, It's like playing yeah it's like okay now I want to my break now I want a real cigarette yeah what now how much you have to pack Cinema think as a first step right and then a carton or did you just take the cart just the car okay so both of you have smoked the car you didn't know okay when you smoke the car what did you notice anything, front like the people noticed that the state was a different kind of cigarette to show it to anybody I had a lot of comments everybody that was near me when I was smoking had a comment it was very much A Conversation Piece a couple folks had to try it never quite finished it the biggest thing with secretaries day was that week and we had non smoker smoking them the girls that don't smoke we went out to us with lunch and we went for when I go to a smoking table for them and we got this, smoking table and I'm passing these out knowing people that place and I kind of thought maybe what are they smoking in passing around over there because we were all talking and really going on about the cigarettes and really became a attraction of like eight people in the corner of Steak and Ale so it they they didn't they commented like the same thing it's too hard to draw part about a few comments that got everybody's attention about how hard they had to draw it anyway, particular means it was arranged was there anyone that just liked it and tried it there any I don't think so they are the smokers preferred they were there all Winston regulars and Winston selects they smoke the regular not the lights and the girls they don't smoke at all they were ever kind of they weren't gagging and nothing but they never like this is different they all thought it was unique that we lay it in the ashtray and there wouldn't be any smoke or thing, they never got smaller as like you know when you're done, how do you how would you answer something like that someone asked you how do you do basically I said there's no more smoke left I had several of tried to relight it and nothing came out and you're done okay let me just, you were talking about when you know they're done you were talking about we need when you know it was done or when you go to these let's say I'm near your friend I come up the I said well they last as long as a normal cigarette, so pretty much I put the three to five minutes is basically what I saw and what they told us it would last and that's about what it lasted I didn't really try the thing they said you could lay it down for two or three minutes of pick it back up generally I don't claim the cigarettes down even even normals I generally hold on to him and I go out more often than that but I found the last 45 minutes okay what about you Teresa did you get an opportunity to show these to anybody I can't get away, mostly girls that work it in like them because they're going to go he had one what do you how do you I mean what would you say to them when they were they see it first or would you say hey look at this new cigarette well they knew I was coming here to start with for the survey and so they wanted to try it and, what they thought of a genuine are really interested in like how do you how did you start the conversation and say hey guess what yeah well I thought I went to a survey and they understood the cigarette smoke free no ashes you know to try and what were their reactions they were always the same no one really yeah nobody okay and what was the biggest was it taste yeah because you have to draw too hard on, you really I mean Vivid light in it they can get anything at all and I'm your smoke on it have to be lighted and play with the quite a bit to get it to light up the women that had to try to have more problems with the taste and then was worried about him going out some of them first thought that was a cigarette load in the end it's going to blow up it's a gag cigarette never like don't like you said I'm smoking one you're waiting in their way it's pretty good, is this something that can address me earlier today when we were talking with it that a lot of non are we're getting a lot of pressure smokers are getting a lot of pressure from the fact that there's a secondhand smoke and this is a great is able to produce secondhand smoke a lot is it you know where does it come fit into the picture of what's going on out there today you know like we're talking about earlier as a cigarette that does reduce, it's move significantly where where does this fit in I think in restaurants main issue with areas that are basically going smoke-free totally the smokers are taking their business they're they're going elsewhere I think they would try to track that business back I know for a fact the airport's that's lounges in the bars where they used to crowd everybody to smoke that they would make you you couldn't stand in Smoke you had that have a cold, good beer or something they're spending money now these lounges rmp when I walk through them now they're really being hurt their business is down 40 to 60% from the bartender's I've talked to and they're kind of lobbying to get smoking back because the tip money, you think this plate would play a role in this I think that would isolate that area again where we used to be with the crowded smoke-filled rooms it would be reduced down because that seemed to be the biggest complaint that was the smoke-filled rooms they would still allow us to sit there and smoke, what about you Teresa do you see this the cigarette nice if I would I don't think it will I don't think anybody's gonna it's not a smoking now I don't think I'll ever go back and say okay you can smoke if you smoke this new cigarette I don't see that ever happening what about I mean you guys are it sounds like most people that you showed it to really didn't like it that much, I'm curious in the group that you were in when you came in here and talk to that what was the reaction of the group do you remember next what do you think the cigarette is for who do you think would like to cigarette in you can you think of anyone people smoke in their own homes they're going to like it if you have kids maybe smoke in the house they'll like it or if you put smoke in the car because they don't want the odor in the car, okay is this a cigarette that if you were going to watch it let's say you're watching this video and you're working back when Winston Salem on this this cigarette getting two clips ready do you Market this cigarette the cigarette that should be out on the market because it produces secondhand smoke by sunlight and has some benefits to it just check it out we have to improve it a little first make it easier to like make it, it easier lines of you know so teachers Funk means the flavor I think it's very well Market, do you think it's marketable right now if we put it on the market tomorrow t think so probably not the same initially go because of the concept and the uniqueness, but primarily I smoke for the flavor, that's enough so much the drawing on it or the toughness but the flavor of feeling that satisfy my craving okay Teresa you said that you had showed it to some people I guess at work right did you show it to anybody else or did I'm curious did anyone stop either one of you two and actually notice it without you bringing it up if they didn't tell me about that how did that happen and what was what went on like what kind of, and when I do this fellas a nonsmoker and his wife smokes and he's basically kind of rides her all the time and he rides the used to be our plant manager and I was sitting directly beside him and he was noticing that I wasn't burying him to smoke because he generally tries to scoot away from you please smoke while I started telling him about it and he picks it up and thought it looked kind of kind of neat course I told her put down in the napkins the look at money burning anything he thought it was, pretty neat idea, but his thoughts ours no smoking at all he's quit 30 years ago or whatever and he's preaching to his wife quit, I did find that during that time period of that week I smoke probably 30 to 40% more than I normally would have because I had the interim of my camels in between which is back to that satisfaction, okay so I'm curious let's say out of the cities around on the market today would you buy in an average week how much do you how many cigarettes how many packs do you smoke a day one pack two bags are about two pounds to back okay added so that means seven days it's about 14 packs out of this 14 packs would you smoke any eclipse the pack of eclipses are none During the period of the 10 packs of the clips I smoke probably five to, six packs of camels along with which is a little bit more than what I generally spoke to some it varies from time to time because we're smoked us if were depending on if I'm outside of our plan or not I smoke more or I smoked half apples which increases the Pack level today of a smoking area at your work I mean like a slight a designated smoking area yes did you smoke any of these eclipses in there what were people saying I mean people, you're stunning they want to try them so maybe I didn't smoke as many of the of the full pardon I did probably passed out during that interval maybe up to two packs during that time frame when you gave the cigarettes to people what would you say to them just try I want you to explain like the fact that there's sometimes I would tell them because they would see the white pack or the no name on it like what are these and they start asking questions and some I would answer in some other life find out just asked what they thought of them, I'll do my own little survey and and so that's what you were talking about earlier we're not not in I guess no one liked the flavor they didn't care for the drawing part is about it but other than that the thing is they like the uniqueness the single ones thought they were vague great conversation pieces of bringing up conversation, and of course others that have a spouse at home that doesn't like that the smoke about it was great so you can actually taste and hard to draw see ya, what should the government's attitude be toward Reynolds in this cigarette should because right now the government's pretty clear on how they stand on smoking I mean you can't smoke at any public buildings are chords like you had mentioned the military can't smoke in the military anymore what should the government's position Beyond cigarette like this should be any different than any other cigarette like they were probably going to bunch of testing, the biggest factor is the the glycerin difference in the tar nicotine there are pushing for my house standpoint on the individual as well as the second hand smoke and driving it with the second hand smoke people, okay what do you what do you think I mean what is it what should what position should be government on this there are any different than any other cigarette now they should research it I think make sure it's okay but I do think we should be like to smoke somewhere aggressive what say you and I can't see them saying you can smoke these clips in this little area but you can't smoke your Winston's I don't think that's right at all and I don't think they'll do that, um, okay that's it most guys do you have any questions

(950515) (RUNNING TIME 20:14).,
ffxh0257,"on the record at 12:49 p.m., okay before we took a lunch break mrs. dilber we're talking about exhibit number 9 and page number 9, if you could just take a look at that you believe testified that you prepared this chart these charts that are reflected here is that right yes I believe so okay and, believe we left off we're talking about some of the Strategic imperatives that the, specialty generics business would have to undertake in your view too, ultimately increase its net sales looking forward is that fair to sign the form I wouldn't say that it was my view what would you say about that it was a collaborative view of leadership within the business and who include who do you include in that group, it was our marketing team and I guess the the president of the business at that time who was who I'm sorry who was the president has said that time it's a good question I believe it was, give me a second I'm blanking on his name, Walt cuz Marik, where was mr. kasmir egg located at that time our business was in Hazelwood at that time is it hasn't moved since then yes it has where is it now Webster Groves Missouri where is that in relation to Hazelwood eight or ten miles south, what prompted the physical move, it was a decision there was a decision made to co-locate the business with the R&D group, party is research and development research and development, who made that decision I don't know, okay so the Strategic imperatives listed here on page 9 of exhibit 9 number one was a choir up to 300 million in net sales through two or three focused Acquisitions approximately 1 billion dollar investment DC that I do okay is this thing stand today are there have those Acquisitions occurred, now here are they contemplated at this time now, the second bullet point is invest 5% to 7% of specialty generic sales back into R&D to build pipeline value you see that as that happened I don't know this specific percentages but we have invested in R&D is there, are there any opioid products being currently developed, yes what are they, we have an abuse deterrent formulation of Oxycodone, we're final couple of strengths of fentanyl patch, those are the ones that come to mind in terms of opioids okay what was the one you said before the fentanyl patch for federal and he's felt that one Ellie VOR PHA nol, what is that, I don't know the specifics on the product, was rocks ecotone developed prior to well is Roxy codone actually on the market now, Roxy could own is on the market today yes when did that enter the market I don't know, was it on the market in 2016 I believe so, as a Mallinckrodt product I believe so, the next bullet is build and a and d a culture that will grow sales over time and drive value what does that mean, and is abbreviated new drug application so it's a generic drug filing so it was basically, the developed those capabilities to generate and getting ideas approved, okay next operate on a standalone basis what does that mean, this was carved the business out and the resources dedicated to the business I believe was also part of the move to Webster Groves to stand the business up on its own, upgrade Talent across functions with dedicated Rd M and A and Regulatory resources what does that all mean, Rd is research and development MMA is mergers and acquisitions, so I don't know the specifics of that comment did that come from somebody other than you yet to be clear the graphs came from me if this the strategy piece of it would have come from someone else okay this last bullet point diluting specialty generics Financial impact over time via growth in specialty Brands enabling optionality what does that all mean, again those are my comments so I could speculate but I'm not going to do that okay do you know who generated that comment specifically I don't know who had final say in this lies, ultimately this presentation was given by Matt Harbaugh's area, his name is on the front page but you know whether he actually needed I don't know for sure that he actually gave the presentation did he have final approval over all the slides to your knowledge to my knowledge, I don't know, why is the business the generics business declining, it got to be a very competitive Marketplace, any other reasons, but I think the formation of the three big binders we discussed earlier they leverage purchasing power which eroded pricing, when a, salesperson for, Mallinckrodt goes out to talk to potential generics customers, do they promote particular products in those discussions before I am not privy to those conversations, have you ever reviewed the Consolidated financial statements of Mallinckrodt the ones that get sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission, I've reviewed our filings online how often do you do that, just on occasion I see the earnings releases that Mallinckrodt publishes quarterly, do you review the quarterly filings every quarter no have you ever reviewed the entirety of the Consolidated financial statements, that I recall, what role do you have if any in creating the Consolidated financial statements that are filed with the SEC yeah it really don't have a role in and those financial statements information from businesses that you're involved in, ultimately gets input into that financial statement right the Consolidated financial statements that's the first statement it's embarrassing yes okay how does it get from you to the Consolidated financial statement through our financial systems, what is that, is that a thing or group or know it's a thing it's a system so our businesses on j.d. Edwards and the results from JD Edwards feed into Hyperion planning system, Hyperion yeah hyp e RI o n, okay, I'll send somebody pulls it out of that system yes ohh Hyperion planning essentially as a download of our trial balance at a point in time,have you ever had a situation where well let me back up do you know who actually prepares the Consolidated financial statements, specifically no you know what group does it, I believe it's our sccp reporting group, where are they located Hazelwood Missouri, do you know any names of people involved in that group I do first of all who heads it and if you know Megan Roberts, okay and who else is involved in that group, Stacy Phillips, and enter a woman that's a man a woman I mean and there's a Patrick I can't think this last name and Kyle again blanking on his last name, have you ever been contacted by anyone with the SEC reporting group to ask you about any of the information that they were going to include in the Consolidated financial statement, sure I've worked with them with just questions I have from time to time, do you remember any specific instances, a recently I've answered specific questions I've had about our form 10 filing that's upcoming it's for the specialty generics business yes what were the what was the question for questions it was in relation to stand alone cost versus allocations to the business, do you know why the companies file a Consolidated Financial system, no, were you involved in any way in the decision to file a Consolidated financial statement now do you have you ever seen a draft of the Consolidated financial statement before it was actually sent to the Securities Exchange Commission, that's my recollection, do we have any color versions of the song, Mark is exhibit number 10, it's mnk dt1 underscore 000 7870 747 through, 08-30, all right this last copies over a get the mouse but he just slipped off, one for you 10 yes, right so this is a big document with I don't know 80 Pages or so I'm not going to ask you about every single page so you can review as much of this as you want I'll direct you to the specific pages that I'm going to ask about but you can review as much as you want for context my first question of you ever seen this presentation before today I believe so okay and what context did you see it, I believe my boss of time George gabler provided me a copy did he, did you play any role in either preparing this or providing information that ultimately was assimilated into this document yes as we went through a sale process sales process I provided quite a bit of information okay we'll take it do you remember first by category what type of information you provided, sales information and, brings information I believe, okay so what was looking at the just the first page here it says August 2017 project Georgetown management presentation so what what is this what is the purpose of this document the purpose of the document was for management presentations that were made to potential buyers what was credit suisse's role in that they were the bankers on, on our side, was this actually presented to potential buyers I believe so were you involved in those presentations no I was not who on the Mallinckrodt side was involved in the actual presentations if you look at page 3 there's a, looks like some photographs, yeah as I said I wasn't in those presentations but it says today's presenters, you know whether this was presented more than one time,I don't know for sure you know who the potential buyer was there there were a couple of potential buyers yes you know who they were yes who are they in toss, how do you spell that I ntas okay and we're have been do, any others, Platinum capital, and those are the three that I recall we're the work is in toss is that a drug company yes how about order of in do yes and platinum Capital private equity, were you involved in any of the discussions within any of those entities or any other potential buyers yes what was your role in that in those discussions it was generally diligence, which one's all three,how did how did that work with did they contact you with specific questions or, it went through the bankers, and the bankers would ask you specific questions or for specific information yes or set up meetings in did you actually have meetings with representatives from the potential buyers I did, with each of the three of the potential buyers, face to face new Platinum capital and, I don't remember which of the two, Indian Pharma companies that was but one of those and then calls with all three do you remember the nature of the questions that they had for you, not specifically it was all over her about everything, who else on the Mallinckrodt side was involved in those discussions, from a finance perspective yeah the discovery of the discussions that you were involved in yeah so generally George Keller was my boss of time he would have been in those conversations and depending upon subject matter potentially Angie Thomas on Gross to net, but it would probably would have been the three of us who is Angie Thomas she is our manager of gross to net accounting, she would be knowledgeable about the, charge backs and rebate programs yes, did any of the potential buyers in the discussions you're involved in have questions about potential liability for lawsuits resulting from the opioids portion of the business, not in the conversations that I was involved, did you leaving aside with lawyers told you did you ever hear about concerns by the potential buyers about liability for opioids related lawsuits,sure I mean Opie with litigation opioid litigation is a part of this business today so I'm sure there were concerns on buyers behalf, do you did you hear about them expressing that concern to anyone, yes I was aware that there were discussions about, opioid liabilities, do you know why well a backup did any of the three potential buyers actually make an offer to buy the company, I don't know, do you know why the there was never a sales of the company to any of those three bars or any other buyer, I don't know, we heard anything about why the none of the three buyers or no one else actually purchased company,no, I can speculate again but you know I don't want to do that okay well what do you have any, any information about why they didn't buy the company, now many suspicions about why yes your suspicion is ejected full, I don't I think it was not, but they didn't want to buy maybe but that maybe there wasn't the value that melon cry wanted from the business they have an asking price for it I don't find it wasn't aware of a specific asking price, you think Mallinckrodt was over valuing the business and their minds I don't know,who would set the price for the specialty generics business who within the company would be the decision maker on that I don't know if you look at one, of exhibit 10, it says credit Swiss Securities USA LLC has been retained by Mallinckrodt PLC referred to here after as Mallinckrodt or the company to serve as its exclusive financial advisor in connection with the sale called the transaction of its specialty generics business unit hereinafter referred to as Georgetown do you say that so was it Mallinckrodt PLC that was selling the specialty generis business, again you're talking about a legal entity and to my knowledge legal entities don't make decisions, people to your right that's right you know which people were making these decisions, I would imagine that a transaction of this nature wouldn't be made without consent from the board of directors of Mallinckrodt PLC of Mallinckrodt, again whatever they call them, is that fair to sir, when you think of a Mountaintop board of directors are you thinking of the Mallinckrodt PLC board of directors I'm thinking about the board of directors for the publicly traded company the publicly traded company is called Bella crop PLC I don't know, when you read the earnings reports quarterly the general look to see who's making the announcement honestly now I don't look at the detail so I look at the big picture and the news that's coming out and what the earnings look like do you own stock in Mountain a small small amount was that something that was connected to your compensation from the company yes, lease a small amount that means different things to different people we can use a ballpark on the value of the stock you old hold in Mallinckrodt, I think all told vested unvested today twenty thousand dollars and you see you know that sounds like a lot to me so, everybody has a different view you have unvested stock options in Mallinckrodt PLC or whatever the mallik road publicly traded company is yes, when in time will those fast, I don't know the specifics I haven't looked at in a while, what will the impact financially be for you on the spin-off of the specialty generics business, I have no idea, have you looked at what the impact on shareholders will be of that spin-off I have not, so let's, look through we're an exhibit 10,it would have been handy to have like two years ago, let's let's look at first page 3 of exhibit 10 that one with the pictures of the, six and one, your boss back in 2017 was still George keckler yes and his boss the time was dr. Frank scholes, no ok who is George cacklers boss so at the time quite something Finance reports through Finance so his boss was Matt harpole CFO, Was Dina why Matt Harbaugh was not involved in this presentation in August of 2017 Matt was not a part of this business at that time, what was his role in 2017 Chief Financial Officer of the company oh I see okay, I think I understand so the lines of report mr.

Louis plant leading to significant savings do you say that I do okay what is that right folks do it's in reference to a building that we built that are seeing this plant we had a very aged process and we believe that we were one of the, last people processing opium is very labor intensive for a number of reasons we wanted to get out of that building can into a more modern building so this really just replace an old facility and what is the new chemistry for hydrocodone what does that mean it just meant that we were not opium wasn't our starting material it was from poppy straw, and out of poppy straw you can create hydrocodone, not a chemist but yes, is there a difference between the hydrocodone that comes from poppy straw versus the hydrocodone that comes from opium I don't know, do you have any patents, I don't have any patents now every ever, applied for a patent I have not ever participated in developing, anything that led to a patent, no, what is the name for the spin-off company going to be melon cry, who is going to own the name Mallinckrodt if you now, because it's in terms of intellectual property, the name is coming with the spinoff, is it just Mallinckrodt is there some other name to it you know they're part of the name I don't know,do you know who Angus Russell is, I right pardon me I recognize the name I believe he's on our board of directors, were you on, a phone call for you on a phone call with an investor phone call in December of 2018 where the spin-off was announced, December of 2008 Yes just you know two months ago our son, do you know the date I do it was believed December the 6th early December they've been the fifth of 2018, I believe I was on that call, Matthew Harbaugh spoke on the call and some other people do you remember that yes okay, were you in the room with mr. Harbaugh when he was on that call now we're worried, I don't know either my office or at home, do you typically work out of the office yes, do you have a home office as well no this was a call it started at 7:30 a.m., so you're already at your desk for a couple hours, okay so do you, you recall who else spoke on that come phone call, I believe from Archer do anyone else I don't recall anyone else, do you remember a discussion on that call about the cash impact of any sort of opioid settlement, not specifically not if you remember somebody some Executives saying that, the cash impact from any sort of opioid settlement was probably a number of years away, don't specifically remember that do you remember somebody raising the issue of the opioids lawsuits, I honestly remember very little about the call, is there a reason why you remember very little about it I think there's just yeah so much going on that everything's a blur let me you know we've been gone what you guys wanna take a break, we're going off the Record at 1:42 p.m., we are back on the record at 149 p.m., mr. Cooper we've marked as exhibit 11 a document that has on the front Mallinckrodt plans spin-off of specialty generics business to shareholders so it's news provided by Mallinckrodt PLC December 6 2018 at six Eastern do you see that, yes okay and if you flip to the last page it says nine of nine, the third line from the bottom there says Source Mallinckrodt PLC related links WWE mail.com you see that yes I'll represent to you that this was printed from the leaf and melon crowd website directly yes I'm sorry this I take that back this is printed from the pr newswire it's a news release that apparently came from a Lacroix that's what all represent to you first of all you seen this, document ever, or some version of this press release, I had seen some brochure on the press release okay did you see a draft version or something after it was released to the public after it was released to the public okay, did you know about this announcement before it was made to the public, I did, if you look at the top of the second page it's starts with the planned separation there, do you see that yes okay the second sentence says the spin-off is projected to be completed in the second half of 2019 or sooner you see that yes okay, thank you said earlier that your understanding is the current plan is to complete the spit off in the summer of 2019 is that right I believe so is that on track still I don't know, have you ever seen a internal timeline for tasks that need to be completed in order to complete the spinoff, I'm currently working to put together some internal timelines or internal activities that need to be transitioned from a finance perspective, from a finance perspective will the spin off these terms of the tasks that the finance group needs to finish will that be ready in summers 2019, I would expect so, the next sentence or the next paragraph refers to the remaining specialty pharmaceutical Brands company is there a second spin-off contemplates a spin-off of second company contemplated as well not to my knowledge okay, the last sentence there says the remaining company will be renamed at a later date to see that yes do you have any idea what the name of that remaining company will be, no I do not, mr. Russell and gets Russell Ballard crowds chairman of the board again that's the board of Mallinckrodt PLC to your understanding, the board of Mallinckrodt, he said and this is in quotes and we'll get the second sentence in 2016 the board began to explore a range of strategic alternatives for the company's specialty generics business and believes there is a strong rationale and opportunity to create two new appropriately capitalized independent companies to have the potential to unlock and increase value over the long term you see that I do okay is that consistent with your, or information that it was 2016 when the board began to explore a range of strategic alternatives for the specialty generics business, I believe so,mr. Trudeau said this is the fourth paragraph on page 2 of exhibit 11 mr. Trudeau said quote today's announcement is another important step forward in our journey to become an innovation driven pure-play specialty pharmaceutical Brands Growth Company do you see that what is pure play mean check the Forum, I would be speculating have you ever heard that term before, I have do you have it in your mind any notion of what that means I do okay what is that, the want to be a Brand's only company, other words no generic products, yes okay if you flip over to see the third page of exhibit 11,third paragraph Matthew harbach currently Mallinckrodt Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer CFO and president especially generics business is expected to become president and chief executive officer of the new company upon completion of the spin-off to see that I do is that still the plan as far as you know, yes and as president and chief executive officer who would mr. harbach report to you, board of directors so who what is that box you said earlier that's empty currently on the organizational chart has a CFO okay is that a job that you would like to be considered for no did you know who is being considered for that, I've met with one potential candidate, now be somebody who be your boss yes, is there any reason you don't want that job, from all work life perspective yes there are many okay, if you flip to, I guess the before 585 where it says conference call and webcast, his Mallinckrodt will hold a conference call on Thursday December the 6th 2018 beginning at 8:00 a.m. eastern we see that that that was a call that you were on yes did you speak on that call now, the the bottom of this page it says, about the specialty generics disposal group do you see that I do what is the specialty generous disposal group, our business was placed into discontinued operations and February of 2018 at that time they referred to the business as the special you generics disposal group it was the assets that were group for a transaction, do you know whether an impairment on the specialty generics assets was ever included on the Consolidated financial statements I do not, did you have any role in, any discussions about including an impairment for those assets, no, do you know what the criteria are for, including an impairment of Goodwill for a business, not specifically you know whether that was ever done with respect to the specialty generics business amount of God I do was it done yes okay when was that don't remember exactly do you know why it was done our technical Accounting Group routinely reviews and our intangibles to just to be sure that they're not impaired, at some point it was determined that the intangibles were impaired, I presume, do you know who made that decision I do not, how did you learn that there is an impairment reflected on the Consolidated financial statement for the Goodwill associated with this specialty generis business I would have been in earnings release typically the numbers I review or non-gaap, and then the SEC group puts him in the Gap is that how it works essentially it's non-gaap in that it excludes amortization of Goodwill just gives a little bit better picture of how the business is operating and it would include exclude impairments in those some of those type of things and at what point where is the impairment calculated, as I said as our technical Accounting Group that does that, what is the technical Accounting Group, what is it yeah is that what you said technical kind of group yeah what does it say it technical accounting and SEC reporting is a group in our within our control ership corporate controller ship group, okay and that's the SEC is the technical Accounting in the SEC group the same group yes, is that the group Megan Roberts is group yes, yeah,did you give the copy, marked as exhibit number 12, let's call this a collective exhibit and what it is too, excerpts from it's one excerpt from the Mallinckrodt 10-q for a to 12:30 of 16 and then the second or third page has an excerpt from Mallinckrodt nq9 2818 it relates to the same issue that I want to ask you about which is the impairment so you take as much time to review this what I'm going to ask you about first is paragraph 10 which is, on the second page of Goodwill and intangible assets, Okay so, do you know how to read the, notes to the condensed Consolidated financial statement, probably depends upon the note okay well let's look at Note 10 here Goodwill and intangible assets says the gross carrying amount of Goodwill by segment at the end of each period where as follows, there's a specialty Brands and specially generics lines there you see those I'll represent you the highlighting is something that we've added that wasn't on me, the document filed with the SEC so for December 30th of 2016, specialty generics is showing an accumulated impairment of 207 million, you see the I do okay what does that mean, if anything about the value of the Goodwill for the company ejected form if you know, I believe it means that it was impaired, okay and is there at this time does this filing with the Securities Exchange Commission show any impairment for the specialty Brands business, does not, do you know why this impairment was recognized and they Consolidated financial statement in 2016, I believe it was a result of the impairment analysis that was performed by our technical Accounting Group, okay, do you know what the impact on a financial statement is when there's an impairment recognized of Goodwill, the impact on I'm sorry have financial statement yes sir it would reduce your assets it would also be a charge to income, when did you first learn that the Mallinckrodt PLC it's all dated financial statement reflected a impairment of 207 million dollars especially generics business assets which I generally do not see Consolidated financial statements until their release to the public what did you learn, immediately upon the release to the public or could you learn some later point about that quite honestly I don't remember, did you agree with that decision when you first learned about it, again those analyses are prepared by that technical Accounting Group,did you have an opinion one way or the other as to whether that was the correct course of action, based on the information I have no I do not, if you ever heard of an entity called the Mallinckrodt international finance essay, I've I have what is that entity I don't know and I would have thought of myths when he said that so I don't really I've heard it, in what context did you hear about it legal entity discussions, with whom would have been other Mallinckrodt Finance Finance Personnel work tax personnel, did you ever work for Mallinckrodt international finance essay, again I don't know which legal entity I work for I work for Malachi okay I'm out have you ever heard of Mallinckrodt CB LLC, CB right like MCB maybe heard that term no no okay are there two entities called Mallinckrodt ink, I don't know sounds confusing, does, okay have you ever been involved with making a calculation called net debt leverage ratio, no you know what that is I've heard it discussed honoring skulls, have you heard of an organization called Mallinckrodt securitization, now, okay I may be about finish one of we do this let's take a break and I want to talk to my lawyer,

fghb0039,"it's getting pretty late when I hit the trail when you Snoop around for a living like I do it ain't a 9 to 5 job, I knew it was my kind of case the minute I got window, not exactly what you'd call open and shut a map with a message follow the trail of genuine taste something about it I don't know it had a familiar smell like a road I've been down before like a road I definitely wanted to travel again the trail picked up on, on 5th Street and a diner called Joe's Lounge happens to be a hangout of mine I walk in sniffing for Clues and I pick one up right off the bat a familiar Roma like a good smoke like a camel filter hey Roger, mr. O'Leary's waiting for you I wouldn't expect any reception but I knew the name Ned Leary that's about tobacco one of our Jr.'s senior Marketing Manager for Camel and Winston Brands the Larry yep, the come from you, I had something to do with it, so what am I looking for the secret to camels taste it's genuine taste, you can let me in on it strategy consumer strategy sales strategy a way to let the smoking public know, who else needs to be in on it our sales force naturally we're adding a whole new dimension to camel a product story told through personal selling I'm talking about one-on-one sales rep to smoke huh, tell me more we're adding to the Arsenal upping the ante with a product message that will set camel apart from the competition the only one with genuine taste, nice angle the only angle and effective selling tool you think they'll use it they use every good tool they can get their hands on, gonna wait till daylight tomorrow's too late they need this information right away if they want to build their volume and share I got a feeling there's something else going on here,where is everybody knows camels were roaring success thanks to the big guy Joe camp but Joe can't carry the entire load by himself he might be the most popular spokes camel of all time but he needs a product message even Joe knows he's been bugging us for one message the consumer will remember a message that will leverage the true strength of camp and that can be only one thing camels genuine taste, I got an idea I can draw you a picture it's a pyramid camels at the top of course Jose over here doing his part but the brand needs more support that's where genuine taste comes in It's the final leg, it's been there the whole time you bet but out of sight we're putting it in lights where everybody can see it just a minute Larry there's more Jim vest I should have known it RJ r--'s area VP for Southern Sales a heavy hitter, I wondered what his angle was on camels genuine taste it's what we've been missing we hardly ever met a smoker who doesn't like the big guy the big guy Joe Camel but the product then the hurdle now we're going to work that point was something we can own something unique it starts with an 80-year tradition of quality born in 1913, the camel brand stands for Quality like Levi Harley and Zippo they're still around not because we're just okay but because they've always been the best just like camel, you've been keeping this under your hat, just putting it together in a neat package we're making the secret of chemists popularity known to the smoking public a time-tested blend of three premium tobacco we were the first to do it and guess why we did it to strike the right balance between flavor and smoothness and we're still using the three tobacco blend today, the biggest competitor doesn't seem to need a product story what do you think come to where the flavor is means they don't separate their image from the product neither can we we've got the image Advantage but we've got to hit harder on product 80 years worth it smoking Styles have changed over the last 80 years that's exactly right and today there's a style of camel that's right for every smoker 14 Styles and all each one, distinctively balanced for smooth rich flavor but all delivering genuine taste okay you build a mighty strong case for smokers to switch the camera mr. best so, where does the trail go from here where it matters most straight to the point of sales next up a convenience store way up on Broadway first of a dozen points of sale on the trail of camel genuine tape it was already adding up the recipe 3 Premium sabacc mm Blended for the right balance has smooth flavor camels 80-year history now that's what I call a genuine, back but how you going to get the smoker to switch first I got to be put on the trail just like me, the place was jumping, I headed for the Campbell display and blend it into the scene just in time for the Overture excuse me I see

not, it's camel and it offers that same authentic quality it's been a time trusted product for over 80 years and just like Levi's and Harley Kimmel has been the pioneer of quality its quality taste comes from a unique three tobacco blend it was created in 1913 how I never knew that about camel but they only come in full flavor right you'd be surprised camel comes in a variety of styles such as lights wides and special lights 14 Styles and all to suit every smoking taste, and I'll bet there's a camel style you'd enjoy smoking well I really like what I'm smoking and I'm not especially

fhfk0146,"tonight from Washington Crossfire Saturday smoking in the skies no ifs ands or butts on the left part green on the right Fred Barnes in the crossfire Brennan Moran of the tobacco Institute and are enlightened president of citizens against tobacco smoke good evening welcome to Crossfire Saturday coffee tea or cancer that's what anti-smoking advocates, think would be an accurate question from Airline attendants why because they say breathing secondhand smoke in a closed cabinet is a health hazard this week the Senate passed the bill which would ban all smoking on domestic flights less than 90 minutes previously the state of California Air Canada and the House of Representatives enacted similar measures however smoking Advocates insist they have rights too and at any health effects are negligible so is this bill a breath of fresh air or just, other example of Congress as our national Nanny will Reagan signed the legislation should he Fred mr. Lightman I don't smoke I think people who smoke are nothing if they smoke I mean it's a crazy idea is clearly bad for your health but you know I go on flights two or three times a week round trip and smoke has never bothered me it's never irritated me and I've never heard a single person and I talked to a lot of people on flights complain about smoke bothering them how do you explain that well that surprises me because of the nation's 90,000 flight, I'd spent an average of 900 hours per year working in The Airliner cabin and they complain plenty well some of them do not all ninety thousand of them well American Airlines their flight at today or recently did a survey and they showed that 87% on an average were physically harmed by tobacco smoke in The Airliner cabin they want something done there are 450 million passenger trips this year that are going to be made an overwhelming majority of people choose to sit in the non-smoking section they're held hostage, the minority about 12 percent who chew out smoking flight call me ask you about your proof that you have that there's actual Health harm to people sitting in the non-smoking section and having smoke hurt them what what sort of in flight testing evidence do you have the National Academy of Sciences examined this issue a year ago August overwhelmingly a majority said but I know what smoking, did they do in the cabin of airplanes very simple when flight attendants and when passengers get migraine headaches from tobacco smoke that is certainly proof enough when you're saying they didn't do any let's get your side of the story even Fred said the sentence smoking is dangerous do you think smoking causes or contributes to cancer for the smoker I think the smoker has to make that decision that's not my question do you think smoking, let's start at the beginning contribute to our causes cancer statistically there are associations in terms of biological causation that hasn't been found which is why I came to the conclusion that smokers have to make up their own minds we all know what the surgeon general's warning say and in fact the vast majority of people believe it so I think we're intelligent enough is adults to make up our minds when it comes to legislating when and where people can smoke in the airline cabin is a perfect example that has to do with a whole separate range of issues, oh and to answer question previously asked the National Academy of Sciences dude no in Flight testing in fact all of the in Flight testing that's been done and there have been four tests of such have shown in tobacco smoke in the airline cabin isn't a problem isn't that warrant those studies done by the tobacco industry one of those studies was done by the tobacco industry there's a Japanese study there's a federal study in their sister lattice parameter as between taxpayer supported federal agencies like the office of smoking and health the Surgeon General the National Academy of Sciences they, I think that involuntary smoking on airplanes is dangerous to the person who doesn't smoke and it should be banned why should the public believe those objective critics rather than purchased scientists by the tobacco industry doesn't matter who does the the testing was not supported by systematic, testing that is absolutely wrong start it is naive to believe that an industry that produces an addictive in a lethal product would ever admit to any harm associated with the u-33 harms anybody, airplanes had their smoking causes harm to non-smokers let me ask you about the test that are underway right now as I understand it by the Environmental Protection Administration by the labor department by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Transportation they're doing a study on whether there is harm there or not why not wait for their study to be completed before you go in and get this ban on all smoking on airline prices non-smokers have been guinea pigs for too long and they are harmed by it we had three, Federal reports issued last year within a five month period to prove that there is harm associated with better than other wise healthy nonsmoker August the NES airliner study overwhelmingly supported in worldwide web and I can recommend here the former secretary, Transportation Secretary General took a look at that study and said in fact that what she wanted what her Federal agency with the experts wanted was in Flight testing that's what is suggested to towards ourselves that's right he didn't include the NES passive smoking study released in November or the surgeon general's report she totally ignored it one of those, hours a day their eyes water their circuit regulatory functions are impaired if I could quote mr. reichman's favorite study the surgeon general's the surgeon general's report says that there is no allergy to tobacco smoke let's go back to the airline I do remember remember well let's go back to the humidity somewhere in the range of two to four percent that causes those symptoms that causes the dry eyes the scratchy throat all of those things are talking about, Valdez are can be attributed or traced in part to smoking that's what they said I'm sad let me ask you mr. Lightman about some of the claims that have been made by people like yourself who opposed any smoking on airline flights and of course you're not just interested in Banning smoking on the flights of 90 minutes or less you want to ban it entirely on all the lights and on all forms of public transport buses yes and certainly taxis everywhere yes, what evidence do you have for that the surgeon general's report has proven it but let's talk no not that smoking causes cancer the time, the surgeon general's report reviewed scientific literature done by other bodies much the same way that same body of scientific literature has been reviewed before three international conferences reviewing the same body of scientific research said that that's not the case the surgeon general's own report in reviewing the cancer link so to speak so that less than half of the studies came to the conclusion that yet the Surgeon General was staying on soldiers come to the conclusion, that we should ban smoking on airlines the Surgeon General never testified on this Airship so he didn't testify but he is declared in statements that he calls for a band where you can get fans,get fans due to the rapid diffusion of tobacco smoke he just can't separate people on an airplane the tobacco smoke doesn't know where this, isolated separate compartments on airlines would you allow smoking in the smoking-compartment would I like I can't range not if my wife had to work in the area she was a flight attendant you would depend on the attendance health hazard as Paramount that really the patties what is going to be a catalytic Factor we haven't even discussed safety oxygen Michelle tonight and we'll explore other alternatives to this ban on all smoking on airline flights, Konica Duff kaneko's Royal come here's the answer for tough customers a full line of copiers that have proven themselves Top Fin businesses from coast to coast copiers back by, if sales and service that says tough as it is response and that's not just tough that's tough to beat, if you'll roll guess it's powerful chlorine release system deodorizers and fite stain build up so you won't have to clean as often as Santa flush it takes the Beast out of your bowl, the world the hijackers claiming to be Palestinians, these are just two of the three million Afghans who have fled from Soviet Devastation I'm Raymond Burr speaking for the International Rescue committee helping those refugees to rebuild their shattered lives but Afghans are not the only uprooted victims of persecution and Terror there are so many more counting on IRC to help IRC depends on the American Spirit of giving refugees hope for the future we're counting on you II see Bob 16 New York New York 100 36 thanks, you,welcome back to Crossfire Saturday we're discussing the question of cigarette smoking on commercial airline flights should it be banned or is that an imposition on the rights of tobacco smokers our guests are Brennan Moran of the tobacco Institute and are on Lightman the president of citizens against tobacco smoke or cats mr. Lightman what happens if President Reagan vetoes the bill the big Transportation bill that the smoking ban is included in, you have to then start from scratch not start from scratch I think it will create a sense of public outrage in this nation we know what public opinion is on this issue overwhelmingly in favor of a band we are looking forward to presenting testimony at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing that will occur within the next few months on Senator hatch's Bill 51 Senate Bill 51 which will ban smoking in all forms of public transportation and restrictive to designated areas inside terminals that will take care of this notation, and working on this measure anyway we are marking with forward straight ahead let me try a couple of the other claims that the opponents of tobacco smoking on airliners have made they said it causes the retardation of lung development among children now what evidence do you have for that did involuntarily ingesting smoke by children because their lungs not to develop children who live with people who smoke and who were subjected to have impaired lung function I'm also concerned about the, a safety issue that showing on airlines not talking about children who were exposed to the they are harmed there's no doubt about it I don't know why you don't want to admit it but I take my kids on bikes and we sit in a non-smoking section they've never complained they don't say those horrible smokers in the back I wish they view in other words this is not a classic ideological left-right issue since, other deukmejian a prominent Republican California signed a bill Banning smoking in trust State and Senator hatch for example and Bob Dornan who some people in crossfire remember is for van right totally yes maybe I could be aligned yourself with let me ask you a question about tobacco Institute is so excited about this issue that is the costs so what someone doesn't smoke for 90 minutes they'll live fact a live longer if they don't smoke but why do you care that, much since obviously 99.99% of the time someone may smoke there on the ground and it's very infrequently that their on-air how does it cost you it costs us in a lot of different ways the tobacco industry fights and fights very hard at all levels of government to get rid of or to stop government intrusion into these areas where Common Sense situations are already in place where employers where restaurant owners where Airlines were already doing things that accommodate, dude that's majority of the public and that's what public opinion on this issue sub time and time and time again was that the separation of smokers and non-smokers on all flights whether they were 90 or 91 minutes was working well gee I read in the Wall Street Journal that the American Medical Association did a poll and the a Mac I quote everybody all the way from A to B so that 83 percent of doctors favored a band because of health effects 67% of the public favor to ban yes, between 80 and 85 percent the public saying they were sad angry, is the surgeon general's insistence that there be consumer warnings on cigarette snow in my reading am I going back several decades now and then looking at the testimony given I wasn't with the tobacco industry them there was an article you would favor because it gets you out of liability suit one point on public opinion on October 7th before a house Aviation subcommittee hearing the international airline passengers Association released a poll which did make news eighty-three percent of the people on planes don't smoke an overwhelming majority want a, boban the reason for the tobacco companies concern is clear Mark cigarette companies sell cigarettes by convincing people that smoking will help people gain social acceptability but Along Comes A study that says tobacco smoke contaminates and pollutes the air causes harm to innocent people and Presto people don't want to smoke anymore they realize that it harms other pieces of typical anti-smoking reaction trying to make social smoking socially unacceptable trying to legislate a smoke free Society by the year 2000 and where we, we are winning make the tobacco companies look unreasonable well tobacco Institute is looking for reasonable accommodation is those smokers and non-smokers we're not looking for small talk about some of those reasonable accommodations why not have a system of well why not first go in and get the ventilator the ventilation system on planes improved if that's the problem well I know it's really the Naas looked into that need is virtually impossible unless you eliminate the source of the carcinogenic ventilation, how do you feel as an air traveler okay you're there with your family do you know that oxygen masks and ground tests fail to drop because they're mating surfaces are glued shut from tobacco tars out for vowels malfunction you know this is Halloween this is not trick or treat this was given to me by an airline right Clapton it is a great crop half this is tobacco tar that does cause, malfunction of the outflow valve and this is a part of the waste product I don't from somebody's addiction to I feel no health hazard whatsoever, the financial weight of the tobacco Institute on this issue do you know how much money you all spent in PAC contributions or what's called honoraria or dishonor area money for speeches to members in their purse for the personal income we have the same filings is everyone else know the bottom line like I did right now neither can I neither can I, and sometimes you win and sometimes you lose, just putting in the political system the same way other corporations and interest groups do that we can provide information others try to your point of view against Banning smoking on airlines what you're taking smoking as a broad issue out there excise taxes they're smoking restrictions, you as a congressman, yes I do totally going on up on all the real problem on Airlines and see if you want to ban this to now the one problem I've seen doesn't come from smokes growing up in my non-smoking section but from people drinking too much on planes getting rowdy yelling the making a hard time for affect other people when they get Rowdy involuntary drinking is not the same as involuntary come on now you know what I'm talking about because the airline's give them alcohol, they get Rowdy they wander up and down the plane they yell I don't see much of that I don't see much of that at all thank you Fred and I will be back in a moment for a moment, One By One

and I emphasize so called involuntary smoking these people who want to ban smoking on all flights don't want to wait around for the real studies the end flight testing to be done rather afraid of

fhhb0039,"hello Doug this is Sarah McClurkin I think it's time to do the program we talked about you know the one about the cigarette advertising and promotion code, that's right, why don't you pull your crew together and meet with me to map this out, hm, Thursday 10 a.m. that's fine with me good I'll see you then bye, I'm glad you could all make it today we need to find a way to present, the cigarette advertising and promotion code to a very broad audience you know brand marketing field marketing ad agencies sampling contractors right that is everybody that's involved with the creation and execution of cigarette advertising and promotion now I have read this code and I think it's a pretty tough subject to cover because it is so very comprehensive and covers a advertising point of sale promotion materials sampling practices, right it is comprehensive and the codes been updated so it's important that everyone know the new ground rules and that everyone realized the code is a set of guidelines that govern the way we want and intend to do business so what you're saying is the code isn't something we're trying to beat it's really a set of standards that our industry wants to meet that's right so how do we get that point across well first we need to give some background like the fact that the tobacco industry has had a, Terry advertising code since 1964 but I think that we need to go beyond that and we'll talk about why we even have a code and what the code is trying to do we also need to tell people about some important changes in the code like not advertising cigarettes on Billboard's within 500 feet of schools and playgrounds and I think that's a good example of what the code tries to do we don't want children to smoke we don't want to ask for their present in large numbers and to make sure that we're not appealing, children the code now says that we will not mail cigarette samples or cigarette logoed premium items to anyone who hasn't signed a written certification that day already smoked and that they're at least 21 years old and there are a lot of other rules about sampling and direct marketing right for instance we can't give out samples on public streets sidewalks or Parks unless it's an area that's only open to people who can legally buy cigarettes our, this is to rope off an area and restricted mission to those who are 21 or older isn't there also something about people phoning in for cigarettes samples yes there sure is the code says we cannot distribute them that way now I know that this stuff is important but these guidelines are complex and detailed Now isn't there something that we can do to make sure that our people and our suppliers get the point hey how about shooting a video tape we could start with a roleplay to show the steps we go through, to qualify smokers hi hi therefore my shirt are you a smoker yeah are you over 21 years of age may I please see some identification, I hope you enjoy your shirt thanks sure thanks yeah I can really see that working but we need to make the point that we only give away clothing in adult sizes and we interpret that to mean adult size large and extra-large not adult small or medium well you just did so I did, good job okay okay we've covered qualifying smokers by age now what else do we need to talk about I think we need to talk about the claims that we pay to put products and cigarette ads in popular movies mmm-hmm we don't and I think people need to know that that's covered in the code and they need to know that the code spells out some very specific guidelines that govern how we develop cigarette ads well take this ad for example these models are at least, 25 and they have to look at least that old the code says we can show anyone who is well-known as an athlete as a smoker and we can't use testimonials from sports figures or celebrities or actually from anyone else who has a special appeal to anyone who's under 21 when are these people all look healthy and attractive does that violate the code no that's fine it's okay just as long as there's no suggestion that they look good or they're healthy because they, smoke what about ads to show people ceiling bowling or doing some other physical activity no problem that is fine too as long as it's an activity that doesn't require athletic abilities or special stamina that would be beyond what you need for normal Recreation you know you wouldn't want to show a marathon runner standing at a Finish Line having a smoke now this is all serious stuff now is there something we can do to lighten it up sure let's talk about sex, sewer six in advertising it's a major claim against cigarette companies Yeah the code deals with that too in fact it says let me quote cigarette advertising shall not suggest that smoking is essential to social prominence distinction success or sexual attraction nor shall it picture a person smoking in an exaggerated manner so what you're saying is our ads Cannon, apply that smoking a cigarette will make you rich or famous or help you get a date that's right and we need to make those points you know the code isn't very long but it contains a lot of detailed information well never be able to get all of that into the video well we don't have to video is just one way that we let people know we have a set of standards that we follow and then we've changed our code made it stronger yeah, there is one more point we need to make about advertising though cigarette ads cannot appear in Publications directed primarily to those who are under 21 years of age like teen and write on or young Miss and this also includes school college and university media well hold on Sarah I'm confused don't a lot of people over 21 attend colleges and universities yes that's a good point but the code prohibits this type of, start izing because College Publications are likely to be read by people under 21 let's go back to sampling do we need to cover it in detail no we don't our company already has a videotape called sampling our way in fact I brought a copy of it let me show you a clip great, tell me Paul what's the most important thing a sampler has to do all procedures important and must be followed but screen is probably the most important procedure anyone who has given a cigarette sample must be screened as a smoker 21 or old how does the sampler find this out by asking screening questions we always ask hi are you a smoker and even if they're smoking when they come up to us we still ask we only give samples smokers and only two people 21 and older do you always ask their age to experiences, taught us that some older people resent being asked their age so if the smokers obviously over 30 we give them the authorized number of samples hi are you a smoker yes I am enjoy your camel thank you if the smoker is not obviously over 30 we asked what date were you born the date that qualifies a smoker is being 21 years of age or older will always be provided by the market manager Sarah who sees that video well we show it to all of our sampling contractors and their employees, he's well it looks like we have enough to do a video where we go from here how about lunch on you of course okay, you all have copies of the code and you can see that the rules are pretty straightforward but there are a couple of points that I would like to make first why do we even have a code because our industry is interested in making sure that we're marketing our products in a legal and ethical manner we're not interested in trying to appeal to anyone who doesn't already smoked and we're not interested in marketing our products to anyone who's under age, there are 15 million American adults who already choose to smoke if we get more than our current chair of those smokers we're doing our jobs the code helps us effectively Market our products to those smokers without appealing to these other groups are there any questions, what's this in a code regarding certifications do we really get them the Code provides that we will not send samples or promotional items bearing our brand logos through the mail except the persons who are first provided us with sign certifications that they are 21 or older that they are a smoker and that they want to receive the samples or premiums we get these certifications from everyone before we send them samples or premiums in fact we had implemented this as, company practice well before it came out as part of the industry code why well we did it because we don't want to be communicating with children or with non-smokers or with people who don't want to sending them things it wastes our time and our promotional dollars the certification practice is a reasonable step to avoid communicating with inappropriate persons, and except for liars and cheaters it is effective who judges whether a model in an ad looks to be at least 25 years old that's a tough one our code provides that model shall not be under 25 years of age or look under 25 as I get older and older everyone else looks younger and younger all right seriously the age that someone looks really is a matter of judgment we're not trying to appeal to children, Ian, if as some people claim people find the most appealing models to be ones that are their own age 25 builds in a real safety net against the possibility that our advertising will appeal to a child, if we've done an honest job and attempting to meet this requirement I'm satisfied to let those who oppose us take their potshots the law department has a reputation of being pretty tough on this one and it is on our list of things that we consciously check in every ad if I think that a competitor is violating the code what should I do first of all we don't find very much of this going on our competition is just as committed as we are to advertising and promoting their products to smokers, so in a responsible way in a very real way all of our futures depend on it, if you spot what you think is a violation give the Law Department a call if we agree that it's a potential violation will call the other companies Law Department and let them know, we assume that Having learned of a potential violation they'll do what we would do move quickly and effectively to check the facts and if remedial action is necessary take it but don't make the mistake that some of our critics do in an effort to hamper our competition don't read more into the code than is there it's already a pretty tough document, any other questions, well okay, as I think you can see is one of the characters in The videotape said the code isn't a set of rules that we're trying to beat it's a set of standards that our company and our industry want to meet so familiarize yourself with the code and when you're developing advertising promotions sampling or special events look to the code first and let those standards be your guide",0.8520504913513514,0.54772365,0.9128392,fhhb0039,,tobacco; cigarette;<a href='http://www.archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&mediatype=movies&collection=industry-archives'>Browse by keywords

of them or some of the Retailer's eyewitness news reporter glycol Jones joins us now with more on this plan to crack down on the handle well and you've probably seen me sign that convenience stores or even grosser everybody's got to take responsibility for this we're stepping up to the plate and taking responsibility with we card, but it's important that I think we create awareness that this isn't just a retail problem we're going to take the initial steps but it's everybody's problem and we need to deal with it the Indiana Coalition for responsible tobacco retailing has come up with a program to prevent tobacco sales to minors retailers will check the ID of individuals appearing to be under the age of 18 if they attempt to buy tobacco products Kentucky retailers are ready to get tough on teen smokers about 40 retailers attended a training session on how to, say no to minors trying to buy cigarettes a new outdoor campaign to stop the sale of tobacco to children and teenagers is up and running in Louisville it is called week hired if you're under 18 and smoke retailers are warning you they won't sell you cigarettes retailers are letting teens know in a big way they won't break the law the Kentucky Coalition for responsible tobacco retailing unveiled this billboard this morning now a new national campaign is cracking down on sales to minors it began today in San Francisco, and Channel 7's Heather issue Morrow joins us with details Heather World an anywhere you can buy cigarettes you're going to start seeing these we card signs it's part of a national campaign to try to stop teen smoking mostly by educating the clerks who sell the tobacco over the counter-isil campaign to stop the sale of tobacco to minors was launched in Santa Barbara this morning Martha bull joins us now live with more on this Innovative program Martha that's right Debbie's a weak card program is the newest tool for retailers in their fight against selling tobacco, products to minors the goal is to educate every store owner to teach their employees and inform their customers about the tobacco sales laws, received in Nevada a tremendous response are we've done a lot of initiatives here both with the mailing to retailers initially now following up with this we've also contacted vending machine distributors throughout the state asking for decals there and certainly we expect that the decal program and this educational program will go a long ways in this regard I think that Nevada has really stepped up to the plate, plate and we're proud to participate in this program today with you all I do think though it's a very collaborative and Cooperative effort and education is at the heart of all of this despite the short period of time the we card program has been in effect in New York state I think we have seen already enormous results we conducted a survey of retailers across the state and that survey revealed that 35% of all retailers were selling tobacco products to young people but those that were participating in the week our program only, percent that's a substantial reduction I think it's an important ingredient directly attributable to the week I program I think the way card program is great it's great that the retailers and the Grocer's and all of the people who are on the front lines and and having to comply with the law have the incentive and willingness the responsibility to work with us and all of those in law enforcement to comply with the law and to get the word out teen smoking nationally it's on the rise but it can, Taki program called we card is fighting teen smoking by keeping young people from buying tobacco products Jack Williams was in Frankfurt tonight where people in the fight against teen smoking say we card is working it's looking better for the kids in the state of Kentucky and I mean that's the focus we're Johnstone Commissioner of Kentucky's Department of Alcohol Beverage Control says the program is working people really are paying attention to it retailers specifically I am pleased to support the coalition's we card effort I think it is, important step forward in this program we are all working together to make sure that the state law is enforced retailers are the first defense against kids buying cigarettes there's come into the store and wants to buy they're the ones who are there every day every minute and can catch them if you will by demanding their identification card a recent study found 70 percent of retailers sold tobacco products to minors in 1996 but in the, first month of 1997 the table's turned with only 30 percent selling to minors we believe that this turnaround is due to Greater Merchant awareness with the law, we believe that is also due to programs like we card, the Coalition for responsible tobacco retail ings we card program a sensible Solution that's getting positive results in preventing underage tobacco sales",0.8540064930769231,0.75845635,0.9128386,fhhj0223,,tobacco;

Reynolds disputes the studies claim the camel share of the illegal under 18 Market has skyrocketed from half a percent to nearly 33% in just three years the company refused an on-camera interview with a closer look but did talk to WXII TV in Winston-Salem North Carolina in the case of Campbell we can identify 98% of the camel sales the people of legal age, meaning 18 and above or use the RJR Nabisco company is lying or the tens of thousands of children who were surveyed for these studies aligned and people have to decide which is which RJ Reynolds adamantly says it does not advertised to kids or Recruit new smokers RJR Nabisco and the other cigarette companies say the only purpose of their advertising is to encourage brand switching we call that the BS Theory and we don't believe it we think that they are deliberately encouraging children, I want to smoke Daddy smoking activists a camel isn't the only brand going after the kid these tests Billboards in Virginia feature a cool

industry and she is in our Washington Bureau also with us is Joe tie president of stop teenage addiction to tobacco and he is in Springfield Massachusetts welcome to you both Miss Dawson let me begin with you in the question of the day do tobacco companies Target our teenagers absolutely not and in your setup Pacer it gave a number of very bad Impressions first of all let's set the stage if we look at how many teenagers smoke the Centers for Disease Control recently reported, that between the ages of 12 and 18 in the last week just a little bit better than 10% of those youngsters had smoked so youngsters are much more likely not to smoke than to smoke at all but tobacco commonly guys I'm pleased to say that the figures are holding steady well they are holding steady after a very dramatic decline in the late 1970s through the 1980s but tobacco companies think that even that number that 10% in the last week is too high and that's why we've taken a, number of very positive steps to keep kids from smoking if we look at the latest study on teenage smoking published it comes from the American Journal of Public Health that study says that the best way to keep kids from smoking is to give them a tools that they need to reduce peer pressure and in fact the tobacco industry has an active program nationally advertised to give parents those tools for their children we also have programs with retailers so that the kind of thing you saw where a young person is able to go in and purchase cigarettes, illegally in any retail store can be curtailed we go out and we Robbie to raise the age limit in states where 18 isn't the age but let's talk to us a little bit about the advertising specifically she work what what does it say to you about the appeal of the advertising campaign if more kids are recognizing oh Joe Camel than adults well you also found in that study of one thing that the anti smokers won't tell you is that more kids recognize Chevrolet and Ford which certainly aren't childlike products for three to six year old been, just rode a camel that twice as many recognize Chevrolet is recognized Marlborough talking about cars and kids aren't buying cars but kids do recognize things that are advertised to adults you can't reduce Society to the level of a Sandbox Manti smokers would have you believe that if the camel ads were any kind of cigarette ads were removed that somehow kids wouldn't know about cigarettes anymore and that's not the case teenage smoking continues to decline we think that working together we should be able to push it further but reducing ads as, as shown by the World Experience simply isn't going to get you there but I didn't ask you specifically about reducing enzyme talking about the type of advertising do you agree that old Joe Camel is a cartoon I think he has a car he is a cartoon do you also agree that cartoons appeal to children not necessarily you can look at the Jolly Green Giant kids aren't vegetable favorites first of all you can look at the Pink Panther selling insulation not a children's product you can go on and on downloads I'm not sure Walt Disney would, be with you but let's move to Jojo tie you've heard what she's had to say what do you think of it well I think she's not telling the truth first of all teenage smoking did decline in the late 70s and then it has stayed flat throughout the 80s the reason I think because the amount of money spent by the cigarette companies to promote smoking tripled over that time period now there are four recent studies that show cigarette smoking went up between 1987 and the present including the Center for Disease Control ongoing study that, shows that last year teenage smoking actually went up she's not telling the truth about that she's also not telling the truth about the study when she says it more kids recognized Chevrolet than camel that's not true more children recognize camel than almost any other logo with the exception of Walt Disney's logo and they're they're almost identical now once you have and I have the charts right in front of me in the JAMA articles what you have is a higher recognition between those three and six year olds that were looked at, that Ford and Chevrolet than of camel but you want to talk about camel recognition because your agenda is to ban advertising and the only thing you can show is that kids see cigarette ads well that's not a surprise to anyone but that doesn't translate and you haven't made the point that kids are buying more cigarettes and the CDC studies do not show that till everything is on I do have statistics that would show that even though camo is not targeting teens as you say that they have been able to increase, their percentage of the teenage underage Market from a half percent to 33 percent so obviously somebody's getting the message and you also had a representative of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company saying that they can show where their sales are and that the average age of a camel smoker is 35 years old so that's just these numbers are being set out by anti-smoking activists they are not demonstrated in the federal literature which reviews who's smoking and how much they're not demonstrated by the sales, the tobacco companies we surely know how much money they're making and how many cigarettes they're selling wait a minute the people from The Tobacco companies consistently tell the Press they deliberately do not try to study the child market now you're trying to tell us that they do what's the truth the truth is that you need cigarette companies are trying to encourage children to smoke with cartoon characters with sports themes many of these ads violate your own code of advertising ethics the tobacco industry says we have a code of, sizing ethics that prohibits many of the athletic and success-oriented ads that are used to try and encourage children to smell let me get back in here for a minute Miss Dawson do you want teenagers to smoke yes or no absolutely not 18 do you want them to smoke then it is up to them to make their own decision about whether or not they want to be a smoker your campaigns are truly affected you'll make your own business obsolete no because in fact many people start to smoke after the age of 18 and it's up to them at that point before that it is illegal, Eagle it is wrong it shouldn't have actually three out of four according to the CDC begin before the age of 18 according to a federal study that was published in February of 1990 more than half of current smokers started after the age of 18 even if the TAF it's quite a few Miss Dawson thank you very much and mr. Tai same to you thank you one way to stop teen smoking is to take cigarettes away from teenage you can do that by getting tough with Merchants who sell them to young people it's working in Illinois

better than anyone, we're back now and how can you keep kids away from cigarettes is education enough or are new laws necessary with us now or Sergeant Bruce Talbot from Woodbridge Illinois police department and jolly and Davidson an education consultant for the tobacco industry but welcome thank you initially Miss Dawson said that the record industry was taking steps to keep kids from smoking one of them is a program called Helping youth say no it was introduced last year, or what's the point of that program correct it's an educational program for parents the book is designed to backhoe helping youth saying no is designed to help their parents work with their young people in coping with peer pressure because peer pressure is the number one reason why kids try smoking and parents need to be involved they need to work with their youngsters kids need to understand what peer pressure is all about the booklet the second part of the book that helps parents actually it gives them techniques in that they, use to help their youngsters say no to tobacco and a number of other activities they don't want them involved in I have gone through the book many pretty pictures not one picture of a cigarette not one picture of a damaged or diseased lung not one mention of health risks not one mention of cancer it does mention the health risks in that the Surgeon General has said the former Surgeon General had certainly said that all youngsters are well aware of the health claims we recognize that the, or she mm that developed the booklet a group of educational individuals people that have worked with not only children but with parents and attorney that works with Juvenile Justice a number of individuals across the country all of us made the decision that this booklet was important in that it helped youngsters or helped parents work with their youngsters to cope with a peer pressure they have the health information of the another most effective tool well obviously faith in it hasn't proven to be the most, most effective tool because the school's today both public and private have done a far better job with Comprehensive Health education than ever before the kids have the facts what they don't have and what we need to give them is the maturity to make good decisions on these tough issues you have a 16 year old granddaughter grandson something right if he walked into you and said I'm going to start smoking what would you say to him well I'd sit down with him and first of all I'd ask him why I think too many times as parents we do, don't we don't try to find out why the youngster actually wants to do it he probably would come back as most youngsters do and say well all my friends are doing it then we need to sit down and as we would discuss any decision-making we need to talk about Gathering all the information and parents will handle that differently some of them will bring in some information from one Health Organization or perhaps about a program like the policemen here is is advocating and is working very well in Illinois I understand and then you need, talk about the alternative hands talk about the consequences you need to talk about the health risks parents will handle it differently but it's important that we communicate we need to work together Sergeant Talbert is that kind of an approach going to work after doing a three-year drug prevention program in our community full-time what I've learned from our children in Woodridge IL Illinois is that they start smoking not from peer pressure but from industry advertising and let me to explain why I, believe that the industry spends each and every day six million dollars on Advertising if you do a program like this and sit down and talk to your children once or twice a year about smoking every day that the industry pores those millions of dollars in has a greater effect if Peer Pressure was responsible for analysts and smoking there would be no adolescent smoking because 81 percent of high school seniors don't smoke the peer pressure, is against smoking the child that I see in our community who is a young 13 or 14 year old smoker is influenced by media advertising because his own self-esteem is so low is self-concept is so low his peer group identification is broken his school performances broken they use tobacco advertising to prop up their personality to prop up their self-esteem what did you do in Woodridge to, combat the problem you actually legislated it yes we had an instance were 13 and 14 year olds were buying cigarettes at a gas station two blocks from the junior high school the school principal suspended the girl called me into the office and says look I've done my job what are you going to do can't you make those guys stop selling to these children but what we ended up doing when we found that a warning letter from the police department resulted in only an 83 percent sales rates to 13 year old children I wrote a tobacco license law, it really mirrors our liquor license law and it's different from most vehicle license laws in that when we catch you selling to underage minors we suspend your privilege to sell tobacco to anyone it much anyway that we suspend a driver's license when you get three moving versus a that program were implemented nationally the program exists not that exact program but in practically every state there is a law that is there's no enforcement well but that's the problem, awesome and they do need to enforce and I think that's fine in my home state of Iowa not only the retailer is fine but so is the youngster but I like to go back to something he said until I was seeing I was a small the booklet does it thanks for joining us in just a moment, at last

right now the August Bowser Junior High School is holding an anti-smoking rally and let's meet teen rap singers Ricardo Ruiz and soon D tirado hi guys how you doing is it tough to convince other kids not to smoke yeah some kids want to listen and some don't yeah because you know it's sometimes hard but there's a lot of kids out there who listen to us and get the message that we try to get over that we try to portray to our wraps and talking and, stuff like that let's hear one of the wraps that you use to try to get that message out and show us a little right okay, hi what's up is this lime one is it a spicy with Coach a shot we about to kick some funky lyrics on Smokey take us out real fast there we go all right smoking a disease that can bring death are you fooled by this step you can take your chances but in time you will find your mom went blind block out the sun shine paralyzed you were hypnotized controlled by the smoke living in the dark side you think it's cool dragging on a

is a disease that you don't need because once you start smoking your shirt to blunt the next thing you know you're six feet under hey that was great let's hope they hear that message instead of Too Legit to Quit now let's meet the guy who organized today's assembly David Altman is a professor at Stanford and you were behind all of this how tough is it to get kids to really hear what those rappers are saying we found in the city of San Jose that the teenagers really, see through the tactics of the tobacco industry groups like you've seen here today and throughout the city are mounting campaigns throughout San Jose to counter the damaging effects of the tobacco industry we have wraps going on we have counter advertising campaigns some groups have mounted petition drives to get teachers and administrators in their schools not to be allowed to smoke cigarettes and the like so we're really optimistic about the roll, that young people can play in the Tobacco Control effort because I would guess that hearing it from their peers means more, that's true I think peers listen to one another you can see in the audience today that we have a couple hundred kids that are I think

Gary Burger senior vice president of RJ Reynolds tobacco company's research and development department our challenge is to provide the company with a knowledge and tools to remain ahead of the competition we are committed to this task and take great pride in meeting the challenges of tomorrow today pride and progress is a long-standing tradition here at RJ r--, tobacco blind studies that led to Camel cigarettes in 1913 to the introduction of cellophane wrappers in 1931 our company's early successes as an industry leader are Steep and directed research leading to technological achievement in the 1950s Rd developed the first nationally successful filter tips cigarettes Winston and Salem which remain among the nation's top selling cigarette brands we also developed the first, the cigarette that primarily Heats rather than Burns tobacco and we have been consistently in the Forefront of innovation by developing processes needed to introduce lotar Brands and to fully utilize tobacco byproducts RJ Reynolds tobacco has a distinguished record as a company that takes pride in progress and carrying on that tradition today our research and development efforts focus on three main areas first we continuously evaluate, evaluate existing products to improve them or just as important to reduce production costs without compromising product quality second we constantly refine our production processes to keep Pace with the evolving Marketplace and our expanding knowledge base finally we develop new products to meet the ever-changing desires of smokers, our research is vital to maintaining the hundreds of RJR brand Styles marketed in the US and in over 160 countries worldwide let's take a closer look at how the research and development team keeps r.j. Reynolds on The Cutting Edge our technology is dedicated to evaluating our Jr.'s existing cigarette brands several teams including brands are D International Brands product evaluation and sensory product development play a key role in this effort, the Brand's team maintains and improves our current Brands and develops new brand Styles we evaluate and develop materials for our established domestic and Export Brands and ensure they meet RJ are strict requirements for quality and cost, flavor compounds are developed and evaluated to understand how they contribute to each Brands unique taste profile as well as how these flavors interact with tobacco, our research on the tobacco leaf and controlled growing environment is also vital to improving existing products we evaluate the companies Leaf purchase and blending programs and work to improve current products through new filter and fine papers technology the biological chemical and behavioral research efforts of our product evaluation group have made RJ are the leading Authority on Tobacco and tobacco products, in addition our comparative toxicologists investigate the effect of tobacco products and mainstream and environmental tobacco smoke constituents down to the cellular and molecular level health and environmental Sciences uses these and other data to ensure Regulatory Compliance For Occupational Health and environmental practices this includes monitoring current product appropriate use of agricultural chemicals, valuation of the effect of new ingredients and processes on products under development as well as review of scientific literature and when appropriate provide responses to such literature we are also interested in learning more about how and why people smoke to better understand our customers and our Products Research in this and other areas has resulted in the publication of hundreds of articles in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, sensory product development carries our research on consumer response to another level by soliciting smoker reactions regarding the taste and acceptability of our current Brands competitors products and new product prototypes are Jr is able to stay in close touch with the marketplace, our scientists have also studied the chemical properties and biological effects of nicotine publication of their findings in the peer-reviewed scientific literature has added to the body of evidence that nicotine and similar compounds may have therapeutic potential for treating certain neurological diseases such as Parkinson's, our and he's continued evaluation and Improvement efforts keep RJ are at the Forefront of our industry in order to maintain our leadership role however we must continually improve our production processes to stay a step ahead of our competition that's where the process technology and Development Group comes in RJ r-- competes in a rapidly evolving technological environment and does not have the luxury of using off-the-shelf methods of Process Measurement and control when emerging, his demand new measurement and control systems it is our job to create them for example we pioneered a device for measuring sugar levels in the tobacco leaf extensive equipment modifications are sometimes necessary as evidenced by the requirements needed to produce a cigarette that primarily Heats rather than Burns tobacco the achievements of this team range from improving manufacturing productivity to decreasing costs by reducing waste, both are crucial in keeping our Jr.'s brands cost-effective in addition to evaluating and improving existing products and processes Rd is a launching pad for new products the two teams primarily responsible for developing new products or product development and the cigarette technology groups, our product development team investigate specific elements and properties of cigarettes that are important in designing products still on the horizon this includes everything from Research into tobacco blending and flavoring to development of cigarette filter systems these efforts are supported by a full-service state-of-the-art analytical laboratory for determining composition of both tobacco and smoke product development is just one of the areas in, Rd which generates ideas for tomorrow's Technologies the new cigarette Technology Group focuses on emerging brands that have been targeted for development the materials that go into these new products are evaluated for basic chemical composition and physical characteristics tobacco Blends and flavor formulations are developed and evaluated to determine the optimum mix for enhancing taste, our researchers also evaluate the products aerosol characteristics as well as physical properties such as weight circumference and light ability given our continued investments in people facilities and Equipment directed toward developing new and better products and processes are Jr is well-positioned to maintain its technological leadership of the tobacco industry we're proud of the fact that our Jr.'s research and development department has a record of, achievement second to none in a rapidly evolving industry

flwk0146,"can you believe the month of June is OV ER it's a four-letter word that's right so it's ju well, oh why good morning everyone well cigarette smoking has come under attack from doctors lawmakers and non-smokers now that tobacco industry is waging a counter-attack with a series of ads calling attention to the economic cloud of smokers in just a couple minutes one of the industry's top spokesman is going to be joining us to tell us about that war that they're fighting Philip Morris one of America's largest tobacco companies has launched a multi-million dollar ad campaign to emphasize the economic climate, out of smokers the first ads appeared this week in nineteen daily newspapers and they go into 32 National magazines over the next six months Big Stuff joining us is Philip Morris's vice-president for corporate Affairs and publisher of Philip Morris's magazine guy Smith good morning good morning I saw those ads this week in the paper and I said the cigarette companies are finally saying were mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore well we're not mad we just, really just you're not mad right we just want to make sure that are 60 million customers aren't ignored there's 60 million people in this country that smoke live enjoy our product that want it and what's happened in this country is that is that some people in the anti-smoking movement are attempting to make smokers social pariahs and what it is is that smokers contribute economically, culturally socially in an enormous way to the US economy in this country the ad that I saw in the paper said if smokers were a country that have a gross national product of a trillion dollars through it and I was sitting there I said am I supposed to be intimidated by that or I hope not I hope not but no don't be intimidated but if you're an entrepreneur or you're in business it's a missed Economic Opportunity to ignore smokers, you don't really know your way to say you'd better keep that smoking section open in the restaurant you'd better not support stop smoking laws because we've got a lot of money we've got a lot of cloud and we're not going to get pushed around it's not Philip Morris it has Cloud it's the economic force of smokers and think about the restaurant owner I think a restaurant owner if he wants a ban smoking he ought to ban it but not have the government do it what's the rest, owners should be able to do is take care of his clientele and if he wants to have a smoking section for smokers and a non-smoking section 4 is non-smokers he certainly should be able to do that but don't have the Congress or some city council's that you have to do this let him let the free market enterprise system work that there's some pretty daunting numbers in the in the in the ads we might be able to throw one or two of them up right here where did the numbers come from where to where do your statistics come from statistics in, the advertising come from the Roper organization that's burns Roper he's one of the preeminent pollsters and public opinion experts on had they didn't come from the the survey that you did in your own mango know the magazine survey which ran in the winter issue of Philip Morris magazine was a survey of our readers about three-quarters of whom are smokers and a quarter are non-smokers but the only the Roper independent data is what's reflected in, Evert okay this is this is the Philip Morris magazine and I just became aware of it this this past winter you what is not be a smoker what used to be a smoker what's the circulation on this thing that circulation was the summer issue which is on the presses right now is 11.2 million which makes it how big a magazine fifth largest magazine in the country and this is really a way I mean they're all kinds of things in here but the middle of it is the added you are editorial spin right that's right if we can't get it in a, in the Free Press well we'll do our own thing right that's free press yeah well as it is that's right it is free and that's right what we like to say that it presents a less well heard point of view on all kinds of issues relating to smoking less Lawler Brokers what was your reaction this week Canada pest sweeping sweeping legislation in a ban all cigarette advertising going to ban cigarette advertising sponsorship of cultural and sporting events all cigarette packages now have to come with, pamphlets that detail the hazards of smoking if it can happen in Canada certainly can it happen in the United States no and my reaction is thank God for the first amendment that Canada is a wonderful country but they don't have a tradition of the First Amendment the first amendment in this country says you can't be a sensor the government can't censor free speech Just because somebody doesn't want to hear the speech doesn't mean that it's the right thing to do, and what happens to see the problem is the anti smokers say well we're going to ban advertising because it's going to reduce consumption but in countries around the world where that's happened and they're 16 in the country in the world where there's no advertising eight of them in the Eastern Bloc countries where there's no advertising at all but eight other countries consumption is up of tobacco so it isn't going to solve that purpose and what it's going to do is restrict Free Speech all right guys Smith from Philip, Morris thanks for coming in this morning smokers are fighting back to know they used to be an ad like that with the pension and not our brand

fmpj0015,"okay, it's very important that our people disco and our people in the back of company gets now to start running if it's, finished with annual meeting for this year obviously I'm very pleased with the result of the voting as you all know now on very preliminary vote counts the LeBeau Brooks late was, did in I'm not a political expert but from my point of view it's a landslide I think it's the vote was well from what I understand it was at least three or three and a half times to one against le beau and my guess is that if you took out his and icon shares is vote as Tiny indeed probably my guess is eight to one or maybe even, in 21 against his slate so what I see in this is that our shareholders were listening to what we had to say and our shareholders understood that we were listening to them and that's the important thing because what I think our shareholders recognize is this is a fantastic company with great Brands tremendous Brands internationally and domestically both in the tobacco side and the food side they see the value in the company, and they want their management to get back to work and get performance out of this company and that's what we're going to do now that this distraction is behind us so with that said it's just that simple really let me take some questions, yes sir spinoff is something that is going to stay a front-burner issue for our board it's an important priority for us but the key thing is we're not going to do something to injure the whole company in trying to do something that today would be unwise more importantly for us right now is to concentrate, straight on our businesses 1995 and the last part of the year we started to get good performance out of our Reynolds tobacco company which is located here in Winston-Salem we're going to have a terrific year in our tobacco business in 1996 Reynolds tobacco here in Winston-Salem is going to do well and our international business is going to be performing in double digits in 1996 now we're just going to have to, let events unfold, I think our shareholders have really had a full analysis on the spin-off they've been through this they've been listening to it now for eight months as you're aware our shareholders not only resoundingly rejected messrs icon and labo but they also rejected these shareholder proposal on a spin-off and what they're telling us is very clear get the value for us that's, Aunt in the wonderful Brands you have at Reynolds tobacco and at Nabisco and that's what they want us to do now and that's what our management is going to focus on yes sir yes I think what our tobacco company has said publicly and I think what Philip Morris and the others have said is is we're not going to settle those cases we're confident we're going to Prevail in those, cases and that's how we feel right now my own view is I wasn't at the castano hearings but I read in the Wall Street Journal and the other papers what you all have read and I think that tobacco Industries defenses are very strong very strong year for earnings Lieutenant Colonel speaking census figures are too low now I think I think we are job this year is to meet walls, Street expectations and we expect to do that and we also expect to be investing in our tobacco business and in Nabisco now that our balance sheet has been strengthened and that's what I talked about at the annual meeting today how important 1995 was again keep in mind this is a company that had 30 billion dollars of debt just a few years ago and now on an RN Standalone basis we've got that balance sheet down to where our debt is completely manageable and we can now focus on, getting our businesses that's what 1996 is going to be yes sir well I think you can look right now at Reynolds tobacco and see the job that they're doing with their full share Brands and see that they are on the way back I don't know if any of you saw the in the other day in the Wall Street Journal the article on our new red camel and our leverage how we're leveraging our camel Brands I think the company is doing an excellent job, job there you've seen the articles about eclipses are Reynolds tobacco company today is a company with a commitment to grow its earnings it's got new ideas Behind These great Brands and I think we're going to see performance out of Reynolds in 1996 yes, well I can tell you that I have been very much in the business of speaking the Lord shareholders since I've been CEO of this company and I have not heard from mr. LaBelle where mr. icon but I'd speak to any shareholder this company and that's really about all I can say at the moment the only thing I can say about that is, I have no idea what mr. LeBeau is going to do the only thing I know is I've got a mandate from our shareholders to improve the performance of RJR Nabisco and that's what I'm going to do as far as mr. LeBeau is concerned he's going to have to figure that one out for himself, now my guess is the resolution was not defeated as soundly as mr. LeBeau and mr. Icahn work on the other hand our shareholders and the shareholders to whom I've spoken one us to do the best we can to find the right opportunity to spin off the Biscoe now my own view is that will come in the reasonably near future but what's, critical and I think what our shareholders expect management to do in a board of directors to do is not to wreck the company trying to do a spin-off first operate the company get the values that are inherent in that company for your shareholders and if you can spin off in the Pisco if you find the right time then go ahead and do it and keep in mind we've separated those companies the bisko's got it separate balance sheet now it's in a position to be spun off when the right time is there we'll find the right time, practice in Lexington percent of those voting chaplain the same way that's what I understand yet, no I don't not at this point I the only thing I was told really was nothing more than what Mike Harper said to our meeting which is that it did not command a majority of those voting and therefore Was Defeated I don't know what the vote was, I've talked to remember I've talked to quite a lot of our shareholders about why they voted in the consent solicitation and people even though it was a non-binding resolution on a particular issue people had a lot of reasons for voting in that consent solicitation they really some of them voted because they wanted to send us a message that they wanted us to get earnings up at RJR Nabisco as soon as we can others said they wanted increase dividends, others said they wanted us to spin off as soon as we could and there's a kind of a mixed message there I'll tell you something I myself believe that if we can do it at the right time we should separate these businesses so I share that same view with a lot of our shareholders but what the majority of our shareholders are saying today is they're not going to risk our company to trying to do a spin off at the wrong time, I personally blame him for every Dorn Penny of it, the tobacco company is been well represented in all of these matters they've got terrific counsel I think they've got a very good handle on the kinds of issues they're facing and I don't know whether you call them contingency plans or not but I think they've got all of those issues very well in hand, okay well let's take one more question if you have it, I think the fact that we got an opportunity to talk to our shareholders the whole process we've been through has given us a good sense of what they want and you can't always do everything immediately for your shareholders but I have gotten a good sense that they felt the cash power generating power the company is so strong that we ought to try to do more in dividends and frankly that's what we've done okay thank you very much, good morning everyone let me just briefly say how much I appreciate the tremendous support of our 10,000 employees here in Winston-Salem many of whom, tear their time to man that telephones to call shareholders employees Cheryl is retiree shareholders and shareholders all over the country to help win this Battle Force this little no labo sticker was something our employees thought of and passed around the company we've had tremendous support from the local community from all the people in the brokerage firms to people who care, we're about this company and we deeply appreciate the support of all those people and we will do our best to build a great future for this company yes and yes, we have a company-wide bonus system which allows for special bonuses for every single employee in the company when we have a Good Year everyone has a good year over and above their regular pay and benefits are pay and benefits are among the highest in the country period, we work hard to to save every job we can in this company every company in this industry everyone has downsized over the last decade the way we keep our jobs is we sell more cigarettes we make better cigarettes and we Market them better that's how we all keep our jobs no Union what what in the hell did the Union do for Liggett & Myers, I certainly hope so,picture of Cold Stone said he he was expecting double digit passcode both International and you say revenue or profit you specify double-digit volume sales and earnings has that in fact I think very strong growth in unit volume in some of the our newly Emerging Markets former Soviet Union, Union particularly we're running at flat-out capacity High profit margins obviously in the Soviet former Soviet Union are lower than you would find in more developed countries but we're up to 12 and a half share of market up from zero five years ago can you react to the comments made during the meeting that the industry is not doing enough to limits under a smoking, we are doing everything we know how to do and I would say it's not enough it's not just r.j. Reynolds it's all of the the forces working together we talked today about our support the law program we've had that independently studied by the University of Colorado we did a pilot program in Denver I mentioned that we were able to reduce youth access by fifty percent are right decisions, now program is a in over 110 cities reaching three and a half million students a year fully endorsed by the school boards and the principles they wouldn't keep using this program if they didn't think it helped is that enough no we need to have fundamentally tighter enforcement we support that we've got a major program going on in cooperation with the National Association of convenience stores and the food marketing, titute for training for signage and making sure that clerks behind the counter asked for ID that's a single most important thing we can do, yes sir earlier the company had said that they were going to reduce the amount of Joe Camel and and ads in the area so far we haven't seen that a lot of people outside the company has not ever made that statement company has never made a sale someone made that statement at the meeting today but we've never made that statement we use a variety of programs to Market camel and are other brands we do not, is Joe Camel exclusively we rotate to other other creative forms periodic it said it made that might Target younger folks because it's a cartoon character well question we have as you know may know this was studied by the Federal Trade Commission we supplied every single camel document we have 60,000 Pages they worked on it for three years and they concluded that, there is no evidence that this campaign encourages young people to smoke period I do not my testimony is a matter of public record I have reviewed every word of my testimony I would not change a word what I would do was maybe be a little more vocal when I was repeatedly cut off in my answers or, questions were answered for me if you go back and look at the transcript or look at the video you will find out that a I was asked the question are cigarettes addictive I started an explanation first a definition I was cut off and Congressman Wyden said I'll take that as a no and that was typical of the behavior of that committee all day I went there to tell the truth and the, the whole truth and nothing but and I knew there were some folks who wouldn't listen there, but if there were only five people in the audience are on TV who watched it I wanted them to hear and I strove to do that all day long, how would I know that two weeks later we did a survey 45 percent of all Americans said they had seen part or all of those hearings I had over 1,000 letters and phone calls from smokers and non-smokers and I had maybe two of those 1,000 were - one last question yes sir, a situation where I feel might be made for example of where you might be given immunity from lawsuits tobacco lawsuit in exchange for something FDA oversight FDA regulation this industry have a perceived possibility that that might happen when you support that well that that's a very hypothetical question our posture is we have strong defenses against every one of those suits we firmly believe we will prevail in court, and I do see in a broader sense it's not limited to litigation but there has to be some kind of reconciliation in this country that accepts that adults can make the choice to smoke and that we all are unified in keeping cigarettes away from kids and if we can begin to create joint Solutions on those I'm not opposed to, action provided that regulations purpose isn't to prohibit our product we work Germany's a perfect example we are regulated in Germany we have a great working relationship with the German regulatory Authority but in this case you read what the FDA proposes and it's not about kids that's a guys, industry at least look at it and it's working I can't say so me a proposal I've you know I'd look at anything but our focus is winning this litigation and we believe we will thanks very much",0.8377896651020408,0.67641884,0.9128388,fmpj0015,,tobacco; cigarette;<a href='http://www.archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&mediatype=movies&collection=industry-archives'>Browse by keywords in UCSF industry videos</a>,PR 286 RJR NABISCO ANNUAL MEETING PRESS CONFERENCE BENTON CONVENTION CENTER- WINSTON-SALEM NC RAW PROGRAM FOOTAGE 04-17-96 (960417) DUB 10-30-96 (961030).,

there it's like thank God and I appreciate it so thank you guys for showing us playing hooky on me my name is Charles I do this for a living I talk to folks like you all over the country about a variety of things and manufacturers and advertisers you can hear you guys talk about the things you talked about here actually make things better for you later on down the road so I think will participate pushing it, we're going to talk about a lot of different things I want to tell you a little bit about the room how it's set up you can see that microphones there and it's a guy with a camera back there and that's because people are interested in things that we have to say but I don't want them in the same room bother us while we're talking the kind of noisy you know always a sort of the eldest chattering about so it's easy for us to talk to ourselves and then let them just a little walk and walk and talk and do what they want to do and in the context of you guys being here you're here represent yourselves now I say that it sounds kind of weird but what I mean by that is that, when I show you things to talk about things where I really need to hear is if you like something want to hear if you like it you don't like something when you don't like it if you kill are about something which is say yeah yeah kiss me that's just as important as anything else so that means that sometimes we are angry about things sometimes going to disagree about things that's okay whatever your gut feeling is that's really what I want that's what your reaction to things so having said that my Spiel told me oh now do me a favor introduce yourself to me to me who you are what part of town you live in, in what you do during the day time or if you're working on the evening whatever and just because I'm here to have these things was the last CD take or LP that you going through your favorite group is Pete start me out go to school during the day, yeah, so Indian cedia yeah if I really like stuff station, I live on Sixth Street between 1st and 2nd Avenue I just was working for an apartment finding company and now I'm kind of working with my friend who's starting his own real estate business last record I bought was a band called the Toadies on Interscope there I guess my favorite artists is, Peter Gabriel Hershey chocolate last, the Louis Armstrong okay wait a minute he be like Louis Armstrong's first okay and the ducky years or something like that it's interesting it's interesting to be no real love or something yeah, don't know it rip into you rip into yeah and they launched from different get a sore throat okay so here in strong come here and ripping into you what do you what do you think down I think you're nice compared to like a Marlboro Marlboro Mentos tastes like plastic yeah and the Newport the regular Newport did its strong ripped into her lots of weird things about what it does to your lungs but I, like relax more relaxing actually her fiberglass was in a real war that's what I heard and I heard this for years okay however they make your lungs bleed yeah I heard what the fiberglass apart like this is the stuff to make basketball backboard out of my would be sued right I have no idea, so give me another tape flavor it tastes word for describing Newport course the minty minty good I think the lights two regulars of the same something is any different no different interesting it's ironic but refreshing okay okay refreshing taste in your mouth yeah it was not a bad aftertaste okay yeah I think my mental serious attempt to leave like a bad aftertaste I think, also sometimes bad breath I think the mental somehow doesn't do that okay interesting place to place variety of words turn this Ryback great, I want to show you guys some ideas get your opinion about the ideas I had about three or four of them or show it to you and the way I'm going to do it I'm going to show the idea is to you twice the first time I can show you the ideas I literally want you guys to tell me what's off the top of your head as you see you spontaneously come forth whatever feelings you got like this like associations something interests you quirky little things whatever whatever comes to mind is so let me have it, second time will go around and ask you some specific questions the first time I just want to want to hear what spontaneously comes to mind let me clarify as you clarify some thoughts and things like that but basically just give it to me as it comes okay so we will go into another one you can leave your stuff here and you have the outside watch it so worried about you just follow me over,can I bum one, the spot, cigarette anytime is a good time this whole spot the name of the spot and obviously they're trying to say that any spot is a good spot to like one of our spots like at the bus stop or sitting on the beach or with your dog and any time any place it's always great to light up a spot I don't know about the name, Sweet Spot doesn't sound like a cigarette yeah sounds like home fries sweet spuds, anything with Sweden, the green circle, you know how to telephones have it, cigarettes Marlboro one word, Newport anyway, what kind of depends on the demographic whether you're trying to approach women or men or black sword away, yeah I don't know maybe women would drive, I myself wouldn't be interested sweet spots just I guess for the packaging alone almost, I can give you advertise it,sensual one name,personally I like because, it's a cool name is cool because, because you know it's also taking advantage of how you called my rose Red's adapts more to the mental,like you said before it's very essential I think has a lot of sex sex flavor to it if you didn't cells because for a lot of reasons people tend to smoke crosses demographics to I can see kind of it's got, It's kind of like a yuppie Jazzy feel but at the same time you can take it as more like an urban black graphic it works it's kind of a neutral campaign the color itself, it's good art drawings lips very good luck to you have detention I don't know no way you can think like the lips like this is where the cigarette goes and hey you know here it is are showing you what to do in a sense okay, another idea, look at these condition, I mean this is what, this is what a lot of people are wearing now just kind of style, especially stuff with graphics on it, how much work do it yeah, this is the actual packaging you know what you're welcome well actually no it's a mock-up, it's this is interesting compromising, I don't know why the Royal the crown that's like the Palm English, so hip hop thing yeah kind of it's a little confusing I wasn't, what royal 13 what does it mean what is the significance of 13 or oil or for a while what comes to mind, well I think of maybe a British cigarette but obviously it's not, and then just the 13 I mean that's significant with bad luck,it's nice bad guy, like the bag better than the cigarette to the this thing on the this first design here looks like it's a onesie that looks not fully completed three so that's that it's sloppy I don't really want to see a loosen the genic images of the number 13,I don't think marketing cigarettes, I pretty much pushing that bad look issue, which doesn't sound too pleasing smoking a cigarette out, well you know everyone knows that, smoking can cause cancer birth defects on and on so now if you have a server that out yeah my tells you it's bad you don't really want to do it, I think that because nowadays, like the gear that's nice, that's Chloe that's gold and silver yeah, okay it's nicer than like a white T-shirt with you could open a little shop and so it's go diagonal,watch out, okay so now this is something that would trust me myself just at least try give it a shot, medical I don't think these are good idea this packaging looks like a box of crayons, not saying that a child might get curious enough well I had same time I think it almost can attract from him more, especially things like this you know king daddy group Guerrilla girls on the channel but I was a kid I jump on this, nice big and total groups like that Tommy Boy Records this is pretty much just that more y or our Latin thing where, they might jump on this underage okay, then gives you the time, I mean visually this is the most pleasing for me but only because it's like a cashier exploitation after this I mean I don't want buy a pack of cigarettes is looks it's got like the dimension of the casa looks like it's got a gritty Urban post modern feel, it looks so good feeling but of course gospel quotes, what about is you about the exploitation phase that you use it well I'd looks to me like looking at this at first you've got somebody who's obviously drinking something doesn't look like he's having too much fun it looks like there's a wino desperation there's a people looking down this she'll hook she, she you know and is this the man who I mean what what is it there's a gun here it looks like here and his hand with a piece so that's a that's awesome, I just this fire around the building a week is this the distraught is the apocalypse or is it,it looks, the best the best color schemes for the Browns, it's cute,yeah, great party at one point that again goes back into like the black community where if you're trying to push it to one group it's not going to work I like that this is the best the best approach for the Storia because it's kind of, yeah it's a good idea it's more of universe like Cisco world, I think this kind of add is so before it's that's for you so what would you think about it, maybe that and like the Jazz cats that works I mean that's it's kind of like, how would you pronounce that for you think use yeah it's a nice excuse, and then I was I mean almost, I think the way I see it at the same time, let us go back to our original start, it's about what you think is oh he's trying to say that smoking is a part of culture a big part, lunch, that without advertising about any of these different you know schemes at, I guess it would be hard, that's constantly seeing it in different fashions, people's communication, I don't like this including all the cigarettes don't tell me what you don't like it first but tell me why is what do you think it's saying first, the same this one particular, commissioned to do something in the green, good much yeah you look at any of the forget about it very well someone, tipped out, what is the name sweet spot, what, satisfaction, you say you don't like it you don't like it because I just said named Sweet Spot I mean I think just the word spot alone it makes sweet might be able to get away with but spot just as I write for cigarettes about them no just thinking of all the names are on Newport camel I mean I guess because they've been around for so many so many years and of course like anything a new name always takes a while to you know, spot is not a very attractive work you look at it and to pronounce spot I mean it's got - a positive connotations I just took the word spot I'm gonna have a sweet spot so I'm going to spot on my lungs, irritating fit a different idea like the sweet Sun it could be even, I smoke and I know it's bad but, I don't think they should also encourage it, this is the one, look at the packaging, so chocolate bar I think the name, the name of the brand just signifies the packaging how to it, it's really yeah very classy everything you do a little smooth elegant classy,how's your ass for this, self, what is it who is a smoker, I can't really have someone Upper East Side 20-something, this isn't the thing with for me with cigarettes is a color scheme I bit the Marlboro pack looks so donkey a big jagging read this is kind of, British chocolate, give me a,find a scale that was totally whacked extremely fresh where would this be on that scale, six months and months of advertising for even an ounce, I agree that just a spot alone you know what attract people's eyes folks pot you know something like this and something just like this on a white background,what we trying to say here message you getting, was that a cool crowd smokes this, hip crowd, there is a shop not just it's like, England all the smoothest creamiest chocolates the whole thing scheme is like purple just reminds me of like cabarets chocolate the same color scheme as the other pack of cigarettes, I think it's wonderful it's wonderful because it says works because it says blue it's great, the title itself is white, blue could be sad, if you could, single out one color scheme for a cigarette, I got him in the color scheme is used I guess too much, it doesn't say too much to me actually it just seems like a gimmick something that I wouldn't even be interested in wouldn't even bother with it, if I had asked you to give me, I think blue I taste, good taste, the color scheme has anything to do with green is more significant, it's too much like a regular Benson address it's too blue it's not doesn't there's no meant involved,like this one, I really don't like any of my cell phone I had a peg I'm guessing be this one right over here I think he's playing the music, I think the door is very sensuous to have glue, it's good, I guess she's just I don't even know where to move, I mean what they're not really saying anything now that I'm sitting here let's go smoke cigarettes, dear, a surprising extremely smooth taste and new satisfaction smoking pleasure it's the new color, well it's not words that I haven't heard before associated, I like the color of taste, relationship having this is the most mature kind of thing in the room I think but it's still I don't, the color the women in the color and all that it's just need to work I think the marketing needs work but the the name of the cigarette works, I guess it's all this how it tastes, it's more of a younger crowd, 20s, I could see him with any type of nationality race pretty much anybody, what's their Circle to be into, what are they into, Smokin I guess I mean from Home Blues, and I don't know I could just really see anybody into this smoking, more young crowd though, is everybody here loved each of them so of everything, this looks kind of like a like a Paparazzi shot of Rod Stewart early 70s, yeah it's definitely for a young crowd, it looks very much like the marketing for Batman like the color scheme and everything, track this is very attractive, doesn't the one thing that cigarette companies have been able to do this, it causes a feeling of being wanted within some sort of generational the Camel Club of Marlborough Mile Club whatever this doesn't give me anything that I can incorporate it to my personality, it doesn't you know some cigarettes you know advertise with being active whatever being, independent woman whatever this has nothing for me too, well yes this is this cigarette, scale again extremely fresh where are we on that scale, little higher you know these are really cool,where you at, yeah, I'm not really with who they are but, like now I just think they're contradicting everything okay contradiction because Royal 13-inch is assigned a cigarette number 13 should be significant with the cigarette just for the people that are whacked out there, you said that shouldn't be, just work the number 13 should be a certified because just because of people out there who are stupid but there are people out there so I guess understand both sides of the coin, I don't know where the Royal comes in yeah but there's this is really weird is advertising here doing the guys look at himself in the mirror and he looks he's all dappered up mmm yeah he's looking to a crack know what is trying to tell you I mean me trying to say you know sick kind of way that all right you're you're beautiful the outside but as a result of smoking you're riding away you looked into merits showing yourself and push there you go no good, I think she feels too, I don't know I think it's ridiculous why would why would anybody I mean this is perfection is no longer the missing ingredient in the menthol cigarette, why would you start off campaign I think the wouldn't this is not we're not perfect they were throwing ammonia in your tobacco,the packaging is nice to look at comfortable to look at gives you something to do while you're smoking but, you're like me but packages all right yeah colors, if I, have you get a sense of, some of you said something about the tagline that's got nothing to do with questions about what what is, here I want to get a full sense about, some of you said really really wasn't working for you but I just want to get a full sense of why it's not working, not working, the use of quote quotations real or not is pretentious I think the packaging is ugly I think the name itself is ambiguous doesn't go either way, I wouldn't put luck and, what type of person do you expect,almost like a novelty, scale between fresh where are we, wow, scale of 1 to 10, isolate your attention here this is what you are looking at what is it trying to tell you that's what is trying to tell you, what are you getting more, I guess almost can be generated I mean with this advertising right here could be generated to anyone but then you'll go into things okay well can we generate anyone, I think it's fair to say that smoking is universal just how people is just how people are, it's almost a thing in common people have, I like the collage I like the fact that it's trying to to approach as wide a demographic base as possible, I like the little Caso ish jazz club picture it's cool, I like these two this is my favorite out of the form, I really I think that's the best image exit, saying what's he saying that you can have Asian eye or an area and I African lips and we'll all be together smoking are colorful I like I like, the kind of, Atlas he filled the background and then eating the dragon kind of like the North Africa needs that's great work, the name was a, huge, supposed to be like this use of color so they are, Hughes the the letter Z kind of smog, I don't think it's a good idea, rolls more, it's almost hard to pick out some people like maybe it's just something I've never heard anything like that before then again I guess I said that one Marlboro Newport or just as a sound signal, the, peg, cool spots for coffee work or the singer, everyone smokes and if they want smoke some really can't be that different, International cigarette, International brand for one world I think, if I had to, get you looking at this back to say what other kinds of seeds would you expect to be appropriate given what you've read between these two things I say yeah this is why this is getting this is what I expect, definitely pictures with people and two different kinds of things, I don't think that music yeah they could have used anything other than like art or you know these want to be possible to that effect it would have to use some type of art but I guess I miss you what kind of scenes and settings would I would you think would be size because you get besides he would you say that that Rings true I can see that there it was smog is right you know no smog okay that's appropriate not that it's a program for people right now, stretch over to give you what would work if you had to pick up a couple more pictures to put on a pack mule lots more effective as you say then, I don't know I I would do different collages with different colors and, like the collage thing I mean the it's nice it's appealing to the eye the color scheme of that but I can't really think of anything that's related to the Jazz scenario and what what it would be if we took a totally different saying something totally if it's if it's something that was different what would it be, maybe not having all the colors of the letters colored my takeaway from the name itself almost Blends into much and, this has yeah that mean this one has a more ecological feel to it I mean you know that that, strange this one is, if I'd ask you what kind of person would be carrying this, the packaging of this talk I would say like an African-American look son but then you look at an advertisement like this and I would think you know just about anybody gets funky decent cigarette I agree with Chris not the jazz musician I would think Intelligentsia people and, in cities I would put the other one in the collage I could see it appealing to Marlboros and suburbs hmm, so pretty, Forest marketing like everything except,so let me ask you, if I can get you to stretch out for a second I know that, Chris is gone to the John but you can walk around for this one little bit if I had to ask you, here for the taste of what you expect Royal for Tina taste like would that be I think it's, how would I describe the taste of world 13 tears Howard I would imagine it to taste how would you imagine I would imagine it to taste not strong not specific, credible flavorful, looks to me like kind of cigarette gives me a headache it's got too much other than tobacco and, okay when you break it up and it's not doesn't look like regular tobacco right right right, I can't see, Travis you what you think the taste of Sweet Spot would be like what you're saying, I think it would be a lighter cigarette I would kind of guess I would presume that it would taste sweet, like sweet it's sweet into the cigarette sugar, I believe, it tastes sweet and close to the filter, you say about being a school, I think blue is being more like a regular cigarette habit but I think blue is the closest to describe him and all taste I would probably consider blue to be somewhere down the line to Newport, I have to agree I think, we're going to look at new portal light because there's a huge difference between important life as far as consistency of them but I see cool refreshing yeah, if I had asked you about Hughes, I don't know am I allowed to take into the fact that I've seen the color scheme with a box I would consider him to be Mighty camel I don't make Cattleman, Rusev, so I agree almost exactly with friend that if it's supposed to be some type of universal cigarette that the majority of cigarettes at Arsenal environmental so, wouldn't like to be nominal to Europe, Ruby, collectively, if I had my scalp some of those, extremely flesh to totally whack, long this dimension, wind these cigarettes up, this would have to be the worst I mean that's just the the grossest I can use that one then this I have to go,guess, that kind of, no it's like reputa bility to it's like I feel like something the ones that are already established or more legitimate my minor, but I would have to say that, I've always kind of liked it that's good, these are like together on the same level, where you at I got come to a consensus pretty soon here I think these are really bad some reason they look like crayons and these go next to because this is too much I think, just, this is a great this is this is more casual I think more of okay's and have a cigarette no problem it's not an alluring box and it's just incredible I think so that's first one, all right I've got a lot of different orders here so I want you guys now to come together and say to yourself collectively, we like the blue right lose nice yeah I think that's the best loser, go for it talk to you about advancing Hedges box looks like a horrible couch slip, I guess if I had to pick collectively I guess who perhaps would be Salem was pretty ugly Packaging, the Hughes look like Beavis and Butt-head from far away if you really look at it they really didn't your I really do ready, so my positive with that and right which one as far as being yeah the end of the scale yeah where are we, I don't think that that bad I mean again it just appealed maybe the color scheme and too many children and it's just too much going on in there and guess what, guess I can go with that, help me understand, what's the absolute worst to I'm with Newport I think it's just it's just terrible packaging it says nothing about the cigarette, I got a lot of bad Benson had just got a lot of bad Newport where you at people, okay okay, well then let me ask you something different slightly different if you had to pick up one of these packs this is the new packs right now which one would you pick up left Adam besides the blue know between all four look up between blue and everything's we spot know right now please switch back Royal and fuse, we pick The Sweet Spot, so we're all over them so for you sweet spot is closest to what kind of taste you that's on the table they would because you too, Benson Hedges the you, blue is closest to what kind of taste on the table, this is closest to, yeah, taste on the table, okay, exactly, cigarette, do you think these are these don't see the beauty secrets we bought, this tobacco, code which I guess is a different name Internationals card, it's, you feel this box it's not a shiny, texture, you seem like the safest because Come On You Really Gonna smoke my movies, this would go for this one first right forget the name, I would because it's reminds me of like Dunhill or something like that just out of curiosity, if I were to tell you that Hughes is made up

team drivers are Al Unser jr. who set the record for the fastest 500 mile race Emerson fittipaldi the world famous Brazilian driver with two World Championships and Paul Tracy a 25 year old known for his talent and aggression, arriving The Day Before the Race Philip Morris reps Peter Silva Gina Preston Bolden Jim mccrady and Kim McGinnis will get a behind-the-scenes look at the world of professional IndyCar racing division of the Marlboro Penske Racing team is to be a consistent winner to be competitive to have a vision that we have a team working together in One Direction the idea of vision really starts with what would you like to suggest to look like that a time in the future, ER and you say what would success look like a year from now for it and from that then you can start your plan Barbara Team Penske has really set the standard and Racing for quite a long time and what that means when I say that is if they're the best prepared race cars they're the best organized team out there when I start to work on Monday morning I already know what I'm going to be doing Tuesday and farther down the week Mondays already here you have to get the you have, to assume that that day is done you just can't think about my you've got to be ready for every call when you get up that morning, September 17th the racers assemble for qualifying and the pit crew perfects its routine as Marlboro Team Penske prepares to beat the track record is the first to go out the way that I job is changing these days that we have to rely on so many other people in order for us to be able to perform my job correctly you've got a crew chief he's basically the guy that oversees everything he's got a first mechanic which is his right hand man, that's the guy he goes to when when the heat's on and then you have specialty guys who come in like myself who does the gears fresh tires and a cold trap will cause Unser to place a disappointing 18th in the qualifying further back in the lineup all Tracy gets his chance to qualify a Ab in the field and for that we have a sense on paper but here the results are instantly put up a video screen so met nobody has this, questions they just have to look for the biggest change in the last couple of years has been in the electronics areas on the car and Telemetry and particular so we're actually looking over our shoulders he's driving now we were bombarded with lots of paperwork trying to find actual documents with The PowerBook everything is rather fingertips we can also show the retailer certain information that he may request, Tracy not only qualifies but beats the Nazareth track record with a speed of 185 miles per hour it's a new track record all weekend people for running really quickly this is this almost 2/10 pick any random practice did a poly learns about track conditions from Tracy before he goes out your teammate is really your yardstick, that you measure Yourself by you know I know I did when I was driving because I knew that that driver had the same equipment I did and if he was ahead of me and something I'm not doing something right well a lot of times we like to Talk Amongst ourselves because I might have an idea of some way to handle the situation or solve a problem do we have to make adjustments are we on the right track how can we do things better that's what continuous improvements all about it's continuous Improvement on the job on the baseboard but also continuous Improvement when you step back, back from the job to plan what you're going to do next so we constantly have to be looking at what are our options we've got to develop a game plan in order to meet whatever might be unexpected from the standpoint of rules are also issues that might come up from the standpoint of competition environment is changing rapidly, Lee we have many issues facing us out there in the field and in order for us to stay ahead of the game we have to continuously improve with a top speed of 185 point six miles per hour Mo Beach Tracy and takes the pole in qualifying the Marlboro Penske team is broken to track records at the Nazareth Speedway in the same day, September 18th the sellout crowd awaits the beginning of the 200-lap race looking forward to seeing Marlborough go over there yeah the the finish the Finish Line see how much I know about raising gentlemen start your engines there's the green here we go, the support you're putting your life at risk if you're out there to try to go as fast as you could physically physically drive the car with an 11 cm x over the lemon, anything can happen in a race a lap car can spit out in front of you and take you out or whatever leave the race Mario Andretti drifts into Eddie cheever breaking his car's front suspension and ready is okay in the battle for fifth place Adrian Fernandez attempts to pass Jacques Villeneuve, Hernandez hits the wall three times and walks away shaken but unharmed and Nigel Mansell unhappy with how his car is handling drops out of the race yet have tough skin and be able to grow things off your shoulder so rejection is part of the job there's nothing you can do about it just something you got to get comfortable in being successful because now you have to think about what am I going to do next I'm going to talk, top what I've just done the whole job is got faster and everything that Philip Morris has done for us is related to speed we've done Tire changes in six seconds five six seconds but under the gun I've seen you know in competitions and things like that a five second stop you have a program that you want to sell in you have to do a very quickly because he doesn't want to take too much time away from the store so you have to be on target with all the information It's always important, the quickest they say oh well we finished second s first move while Paul Tracy holds on to the lead little Al makes one of his incredible runs to the front from deep in the field fittipaldi is only a few seconds behind first you have to see why you starting the grade you know how it shows start in the fall and you can take the lead in turn one and you have to try to break away from everybody coming at certain points of the year you want to be at certain places just like in a, race okay at the halfway mark we want to be in the top five we want to talk about Flawless execution that's the key job of the Salesforce competition is so top of many cars right now it's just you know there's there's 30 guys out there that are all Champions and it's getting tough just to make it in the field we have for other companies chasing us and so you always have to stay on top of things and they're not letting go gray skies out here I mean they're still right on their tail boom or so we strike strike, trying to be the market here the each back on the street leader you products new programs new promotions and we as reps have to follow that bleed and I think through our leadership and some of the plans that we have coming up we are positioned to keep our share to grow through the last three months of the year and to make our move to finish the race for 192 of the 200 laps Paul Tracy holds on to the lead, well Tracy making that final turn out and ahead of the checkered flag waves give me the wind tunnel has it all Tracy has scored his first Victory Marlboro Team Penske

number one cigarette winning the greatest feeling in the world but you can't rest on your laurels fact right now in the region we're winning and that's the prime time when we should be doing more to prepare for the next race, when Marlboro and Penske joined forces in 1990 they set out to create a team with the best organization and most talented roster in IndyCar racing, since then Marlboro Team

competition ever seen in IndyCar racing in 1994 the Marlborough team swept the field finishing 1234 the season in racing, finishing first is what it's all about winning is the objective, there can only be one number one there can only be one world champion, Barbara Hellyer timekeeper on racing data and Analysis well it means I keep track of every car every lap all through the race all through the practice qualifying basically what I do creates the record and Roger and the guys look on the screen and let us know where our cars are and how they're interacting with the rest of the field teams watching the screen, Rogers watching the screen to see where we are how far behind we are how far ahead we are the competition it's really great especially when the race is running, Mears racing advisor on team strength what is good about a team and why utilize the team is thinking of all three drivers sitting in there and the engineers and we're all talking about different things and one driver or one engineer may say something that Sparks a whole nother train of thought that whole another way of looking at the problem to solve it and you know how that goes you can you can be so focused on a problem somebody can walk in the front door and say well why don't you do this and you go why didn't I think of that,team manager Chuck spray on continuous Improvement we've learned from our past mistakes we adopted some different philosophies and winter testing but in the end of the day we're still preparing everything the best we can but you know when the car is absolutely right the driver says it's magic don't touch it perfect element you know then there's still there's still always more after that there's never enough, Roger Penske on building a championship team while the main ingredients of a vision are the people and most important is half of the people pulling in One Direction and morale is the most important thing in racing when you win it creates a tremendous amount of

fnpj0015,"look at me and talk with me and state your name I don't know okay my name is Cody Miller and I live here in Las Vegas, yes and customarily I smoke Alpine cigarettes Alpine lights prefer them because they're cheaper but go for the bargain I started smoking at age 32 isn't that weird I was always as always inhabit anti-smoking I know that I can use this, smoking because I was so tired of people around me smoking and secondhand smoke in my face and being offended by that I decided it was a mild case of if you can't beat them join them, how did your about Cliffs, well I was called for a survey and one thing led to another yeah I was I was totally without any ideas what it was going to be about other than pertain to cigarettes so what, well I from the presentation I knew that there were this was something extraordinary or that it that it reported to me and so I was looking forward to finding out if the product met the expectations that were raised by the material that they presented so well, my first impressions were I wasn't sure what to make of it because it did have a bit of a different flavor and it was a unique distinctive Flavour and at first I kind of liked it but it was there was uncertainty about about it however as I smoked more one cigarette followed another that I found I found growing, hang on me I began to really like the taste and found that they were smooth and Mild satisfying and I felt that if the material presented was correct that these cigarettes were far lower tar nicotine product and that smoking them wouldn't be quite as harmful as smoking the conventional cigarettes, I smoke Light cigarettes yeah primarily to cut down on the tar and nicotine yes I did, I really to be honest I couldn't tell the difference, right I just picked ice pick up the miles because they were the miles and I would have preferred the full flavor I probably would have went with those but since there really was no perceptible difference to me I went ahead and decided to go with the life so after you, oh yes and aside from that I I timed them I'd smoke when I smoked one of my regular cigarettes and their 100 likes by the way these are king-size I would count the number of Puffs that I would get and it would usually be 13 14 15 maybe, then when I smoked the eclipse the king-size Eclipse I would find that I would get on an average of three to five more Puffs on a cliff cigarette than on the help lines that with you yeah so I found that it was a shorter cigarette that smoked longer than the 100 and, that there was nothing mentioned about that many of the material they were said to smoke the same length and there's I wouldn't know whether another person's experience would be the same as mine but I tried that a few times and every time it's consistently about three to five cups more / cigarette after you after you're trying to did you like the other benefits that came came with oh absolutely, I find myself now that I've gotten used to these forgetting about about having an ashtray nearby I'm smoking a regular cigarette and I'll be walking around I'll have accumulated a large Ash and we'll be ready to fall off and where's that ashtray but with e-cigarettes not a problem because you never need an ashtray you just need a proper place to dispose of it when you're done, but I find that the benefits of the cigarette are certainly every bit as good as they were presented to be that the lack of secondhand smoke is truly truly great there is no smoke coming out the end of the cigarette right now and although they say it's 90%, and smoke free I don't see any that that can percent might be what I'm exhaling probably but I find other benefits as well I work occasionally with computers and I'm a musician and I play guitar and I play keyboards have a home studio and I often smoke while I'm working with one with my instrument, and frequently I'll have, I won't have to hands-free now in the past if I'm busy with my hands playing music I have a cigarette in my mouth it always bothered me to have the smoke pouring off the end of the cigarette going in my eyes burning my eyes going up my nose and being nasty and that problem is totally eliminated with the eclipse and put it in my mouth, I can hold it there as long as I want to As Long As I need to and there's no problem whatsoever and that's something I always hated about cigarettes was how if you take them away from your mouth you're fine I can't put them up take a puff but if you leave it in your mouth like you know some Joe mod cock into the over his cigarette that you fumigate yourself, and this has totally eliminated that problem another great thing is that when you're working around expensive electronic equipment there's a problem with ashes ashes and debris coming from up the cigarette and gets in between your computer keys and so forth and creates a problem and of course there, since there's no ashes on an eclipse there's a well there's a few little Little Ashes around the tip that lights up to convince you that it's a cigarette you're smoking but that's not a problem it's just minor, if you had to well since there's at least three things that come to mind it's kind of hard to pick one and I unfortunately haven't had the privilege of subjecting non-smokers to to smoking Eclipse cigarettes in their company and that's too bad because I'd really like to gauge their reaction and like to see, see how they feel about it but that would perhaps be one of the benefits right there would be the they're probably socially acceptable they may may actually be a an alternative for people who have been forced to take their cigarettes elsewhere they may be able to return and smoke in the company of non-smokers, we don't know I'm put I would like to I'd like to see the reactions of people now other smokers have have had various reactions I they're mostly favorable however to be truthful there have been a few problems my mother, he's 80 years old she's still smoking and he's a lifelong smoker still hanging in there and she feels that they are in her words too much work that there's too much effort involved in drawing the smoke and so forth and then the other problem she had was that there's a there's a great deal of heat that builds up in the body of the, above the filter and flowing here below the printed ring you're okay if your fingers get up there I'm going to look smoking a cigarette pretty hot Carson discomfort she claimed to have been burned by now I'm sure that these are problems that that they're working on it this week we searches, to help them develop the cigarette a little further but that's one of the things that one of the reactions aside from that my girlfriend comments that she thinks they're stinky he thinks they have an aroma that she doesn't like she smoked him she doesn't she like some fine so but she thinks they smell funny that there's something, about this month itself, I don't know if you guys both welcome it yeah was there a difference like in the amount of smoke gives you a good life oh yeah yeah and another thing I did playing around with them was to take the kleenex test and blow smoke through tissue and then do it with a regular cigarette and see the, difference in the yellow stains the tar stains on the tissue from a regular cigarette compared to the almost complete absence of abstaining from from the eclipse and also drawing the smoke directly through the tissue and on a regular cigarette you have a dark dark spot on there right away one paw and you have a dark spot you take, positive got a you've got practically a Black Ink Spot and with the eclipse taking three or four Puffs through the clean through the tissue there is hardly any stain that looks less than the than the one from the first puff on the regular cigarette now of course as you if you continue to do this going from the tip of the cigarette down to, or the end that's where the concentration is greatest thing there's just a huge amount of stain from a conventional cigarette however these cigarettes are consistent there's no more no more residual stain at the low end and there is when you first slide it so they managed to filter that really well though quality of this smoke is consistent, sure I think of a person has white or light-colored furnishings and curtains and draperies that sort of thing that they're going to stay white they're going to stay light and bright colors longer because, everybody know so you going to a smoker's house are smoking family's house that there is not just the odor that permeates the house but the stain the smoke color accouterments the draperies the curtains and even, the bed sheets and so forth are going to end up being yellow and I really feel that the eclipse is going to eliminate that problem for people if they smoke the eclipse consistently, I think so earlier on in the study I decided that I well even after the first the first phase of the study where I just had two packs I decided that I would want to have them around that if I stayed with a regular brand such as Alpine that I would want to have a clips for certain occasions when when I desired the, they offer and then as I continued in the study I began to feel that I would prefer to have these cigarettes most of the time and at this point I feel that I could pretty much do without the other cigarettes that these meet all my needs just fine yeah we're all so I'll take this time to, two, did you said you showed it to a couple smokers who were like yeah, yeah there's a few people that that were really impressed I think everybody was was impressed everybody was amazed there was a cigarette that was was this different this unusual and drastically different from what people are used to and I had one young lady asked me if I had a cigarette Despair and she took a look at the end, have sangria sure this isn't going to explode you're not heating give me an exploding cigarette ditch a serious it's a new kind of cigarette it's not going to blow up no I'm serious yeah she was she was pretty impressed she said they're good they taste great, so yeah her overall impression was good I ended up letting her I was giving her a little ride and let her out of the car before she had smoked the whole cigarette butt her initial reaction was very favorable once you got past the fear of it exploding, well I don't want to know why if there's an advanced in cigarettes that it's going to make cigarettes more socially acceptable than they they are present that are going to eliminate some of the reported dangers of, non-smokers and others to secondhand smoke I'd like to know why they would step in and try and stop that progress from being made and I would write my congressman and representative and present my side of the story and again asked them to look into the matter to allow us the, Adam to decide for ourselves, write a letter to my congressman and the House Representatives to the local and federal Representatives, and state why I thought that the cigarette was beneficial on the market and ask them to look into the matter and to allow it to to be present I'd want to know why they felt that there should be a law against it white if progress is being made toward making, taking cigarettes more while say making cigarettes and less harmful or less detrimental to the non-smoking public that that's something that should be encouraged rather than stifle and I would I'd certainly State my feelings on the matter and let them be know, one of the things I'm going to give you a first half of the sentence would be eclipsed makes me feel why aren't you here to me again so I know what I mean, me feel happy to be alive Clips makes me feel like smoking cigarettes is is enjoyable again and I can I can enjoy a Clips without feeling guilty that I'm subjecting other people to my smoke that I have I've made a choice, I've made it a choice to smoke cigarettes and and I can do agree with people that don't smoke that they shouldn't be subjected to the Smoke just because they're sharing the space with a smoker that time and I feel that really isn't fair and however the eclipse cigarettes have done manufacturers have done something to minimize that, and I really believe that smoking eclipse in public is less of a of an offense and less of a hazard to non-smokers children and other, now prior to my exposure to we clip cigarettes say that again prior to my exposure to Eclipse cigarettes I made my cigarette purchasing decisions, based on price alone and if I could find a generic cigarette that was tasting and burn evenly I buy it and my main consideration was to save save a dime for pack if I could whatever now these cigarettes the benefits of these cigarettes are so substantial to me, that I would pay the standard price of these cigarettes were available at the premium price like your standard Winston's are well I would say Marlboro but I think they've got the price on Marlboros but oh you know what I mean your standard premium cigarette price that would be fine because I believe there were, worth it and I would make them my regular cigarettes, yeah, prior to my exposure to a clip cigarettes I made my decisions about purchasing cigarettes based solely on the price and I was looking for a bargain I would buy any generic cigarette that that as long as it tastes good and burned evenly and it was fine by me however since my exposure to the clips, and the benefits that they offer I feel that if they were offered at the price of a standard premium brand of cigarettes that that would be a price that I'd be willing to pay to make Eclipse my regular brand, revolutionary, and at that one weird thing I'm a man of many words they are there were their revolutionary cigarette there's never been anything like them, I think he's not a good",0.8305009877777778,0.5981993,0.9128386,fnpj0015,,tobacco;

fpnh0063,"ladies and Gentlemen please welcome the director of Market planning and information and E-Pass look and group manager sales analysis Susan Smith, good morning Susan and I will present an industry overview to include significant events and Trends affecting our industry our competitors and lorillard itself, in terms of format will look at the legal political and social events that helped shape our environment this year, then we'll look at sales performance for individual companies Brands and product segments based on our latest available data, 1997 so many of the same themes we had observed in 1996 extended into 1997 some of them now with interesting twists for example 1996 so a link it's Bennett labo financier Carl Icahn and RJR Nabisco Management in an acrimonious fight whereby Nabisco was in simple terms to either be taken over by Liggett or, broken into several pieces by icon, the Liggett attempt at a merger and the icon takeover attempt were both resolved with RJ Are Victorious and intact however Liggett continued to function as an industry gadfly as they went their own way on legitimate litigation settlements ingredient disclosures conceding cigarettes are addictive and in releasing internal confidential documents over the other manufacturers objections, how ironic that it appears that Liggett initiated the process that could they say lead to their ultimate demise, the unrelenting flood of litigation continued on into the year with now more than 40 States suing the industry for the most part in order to recover health care costs they maintain are attributable to smoking related illnesses, unfortunately as we moved into 1997 and now into 1998 many smell blood in the water and are joining the potential Feeding Frenzy to come, here we see that the industry is being sued by construction trade unions in Connecticut insurance companies in Louisiana the higher education school system in Alabama and on it goes all of them bidding for a piece of heretofore unimaginable billions of dollars, and along with the litigation Trend toward greater government regulation, and restrictions has intensified, the FTC succeeded in getting rid of old Joe camel's successful icon and now appears to be looking next at the mall Borough man, David Kessler formerly head of the FDA claim to be anti tobacco advertising in order to protect our youth, it now appears that his real agenda Banning tobacco advertising aimed at adult smokers as well has been revealed, and municipalities continue to get into the act the map depicted in the upper right corner of this slide shows the New York City council's plan to deal with cigarette advertising, no Billboards permitted within a 1000 foot radius of each dot on the map, to paraphrase the Old Chestnut about bad luck it seems if there weren't any bad news there wouldn't be any news at all, nevertheless unlike mr. Ed's demise our story has a happy ending, important to many of us and perhaps the reason most of you are in the audience today is the fact that lorillard moved its corporate headquarters to Greensboro from New York City this past spring some of us perhaps had inflated or exaggerated expectations about what to expect regarding living in North Carolina, in addition to the fair in addition to the favorable personal housing situation we were favored with a terrific work environment, hear our corporate and Company management participated in a ribbon-cutting ceremony to officially open the building, it's very nice as you will see when you take the tours of the offices organized for you later on today and tomorrow, actually although it really is a wonderful work environment there was one small design flaw the building does not have a separate restroom for executive management as was the case in New York, Senior Executives have had to get the hang of sharing the facilities with mere mortals, no one really likes this Arrangement very much, and while the ribbon-cutting ceremony was going on the Marketing Group celebrating the transition of their Department name to Brand marketing celebrating the opening of the new building celebrating a new one official motto for the headquarters complex and God knows what else we're dedicating the pond on the north side of the building in their own way, without doubt the defining event of 1997 was the tobacco industry's participation in a global settlement of the many issues that have led to the unending stream of litigation we commented on earlier now try as we might we have to this point been unable to meet to work our meeting theme working together for Success into the presentation, and we certainly can't do that at this point for example, here's a collection of comments counter proposals potential revisions from members of Commerce Congress on the proposed settlement, it documents 23 senators and congressmen 's individual plans to change void proposed entirely new settlement terms in the days and weeks following the original attorney general tobacco industry proposed settlement perhaps it's no wonder that Congress appears to be unwilling to resolve the matter in relatively short order there does appear to be a lack of Direction at the top, and with this leadership really who can blame them, once it became clear how much money was stake given just the Florida and Mississippi settlements The Feeding Frenzy really moved into high gear, here we see just about everyone tried to get a share of the settlement spoils individual states the federal government various government agencies tobacco Growers and of course the unending stream of lawyers perhaps this editorial cartoon says it all on that subject, throughout all of these distractions I've talked about let us not lose sight of some more fundamental truths our competitors have not and will not let these things stopped or slowed their efforts to succeed in the marketplace the pressure is always on our Jr is resilient here you see news of a new camel advertising campaign without Joe Campbell the launch of a mental camel brand to directly challenge new, a port in the marketplace and news of additional line extensions targeting Fringe prospects for the camel brand through camel red, RJ R is implemented a direct attack aimed at Newports younger adult franchise in New York City through a repositioned Salem brand, and it didn't in addition to efforts to re-establish the Winston Brand, all this activity took place this year BMW launched a new advertising campaign in support of their Cool brand and still other competitive efforts may be dwarfed by the coming introduction of Marlboro ultralights in January, now all the negative pressures and influences on the industry have nevertheless led to a somewhat surprising result, unit shipments for 1997 versus 1996 will decline We Believe by 1% or less in fact over the last five years the industry's volume decline averages just about one percent per year given these prevailing Trends Laura large performance is all the more impressive up approximately 3% in unit volume and up slightly more and share of Market, two most clearly show how Laura large performance relates to that of the industry as well as competitive companies by Price segment and brand this National overview now concentrates on share of market trends for each, data are based on the latest available you two day period ending September 1997 versus the same nine months a year ago, within our industry the greatest change in recent years has been the turnaround at the full price segment following the major price restructuring in 1993 even now more than four years later full price share currently almost 3/4 of the market continues to increase however while all companies initially benefited from the Resurgence in full price importance only Philip Morris is presently experiencing growth in the, the segment this graph tracks full price share Trends on a quarterly basis since 1992 as can be seen full price importance Rose most dramatically immediately after the industry's price restructuring in August of 1993 yet even since that initial impact full price share has continued to rise having now reached nearly 74 percent of Industry sales or back to the level that, is premium products enjoyed nearly six years ago, breaking down the full price segment by company this table summarizes year-to-date 1997 full price shares for each and then Trends versus year ago both in terms of Point changes as well as percentage differences with gains highlighted in yellow, in total year-to-date full-priced year is up nearly one point with almost with all of that game coming from Philip Morris up almost two points versus year ago conversely each of the other companies have shown losses ranging from 1% for Reynolds to 21% for liquid, of course Laurel Arts loss includes the elimination of two brands that is Harley Davidson and full price style nevertheless even with the impact of these two discontinued brands on our full price trend we continue to outperform and pull further ahead of BMW in this most profitable category, in the face of full price growth the importance of discount products continues to fall however within the discount group the larger branded generic segment has now stabilized with BMW and Reynolds holding share and Laurel Arts new entries offsetting losses for Philip Morris and Liggett at the same time Sheriff private labels which are lowest in price but have no other image are suffering an, I'd rate of decline down 20% this year versus last with all of our competitors losing share from these products this chart Compares share Trends over the last six years for the total discount segment as well as its two components generics the darker lower portion of the bars and private labels the lighter portion on top, in total Sheriff discount products has fallen 10 points since 1993 when their price Advantage was sharply reduced and while the black and white private label group had consistently been declining at the greatest rate this year it is the only price segment that is down off one full point below a year ago now representing just 4% of Industry sales, in contrast after three years of losses the Branded generic group actually showed a fractional increase this year, looking first at generic share Trends by company we can see that the top two contributors to the segment BMW and Reynolds essentially maintain levels versus year ago and while Philip Morris and licking each lost over two tenths of a point those declines were more than offset by Laurel Arts gains tracing to our new entries Maverick specials and at least for a while low price Style, turning to the same breakdown for private labels we see losses for all of our competitors in this group Reynolds is the leader and has the lowest those still sizable rate of decline down 18 percent in comparison Philip Morris is private label share is down 26% now ranking just slightly above Liggett which is also off sharply, now combining all products we see that total share has declined for three companies Reynolds by 2% Brown & Williamson down twice that rate and lick it off a whopping 28 percent more importantly of the two companies that are growing Laurel Arts relative share increase of 4% is actually higher than that for Philip Morris, now let's take a look at the Brand's both full price and discount that are primarily responsible for the share performance of each company beginning with lorillard, in 1997 lorillard will achieve its highest share in 14 years by brand the company's current share growth of 4% is coming from full price Newport and discounted Maverick specials, this chart Compares shares for Newport and all other lorillard full price and total discount Brands again based on nine months year-to-date 1996 in Orange versus 1997 in green with actual point changes on top, I pull Our Brands Newport is certainly the greatest contributor to Laurel Arts volume and growth up another four tenths of a point this year, but again transfer remaining Brands by Price group have been distorted by product replacements, the impact of these brand changes on Laurel Arts full price segment is summarized here as you know full-priced Harley-Davidson was discontinued last year and in May of 1997 the price of style was lowered together the removal of these two Brands reduced our full price total by nearly half a point note that without their affect our full price share would actually have been up, similarly our discount share Trend this year has been affected by the addition of new entries Maverick specials which replaced Harley and style at a reduced price note here that despite the support required to introduce these new products old gold fell only slightly, combining old and new versions of reposition Brands this chart Compares 1996 versus 1997 share trends for all of our major products other than Newport of the five Kent has had the greatest loss but is showing much stronger Trends in the heavy of markets of our next two Brands true which is a National Distribution is now just one one-hundredth of a SharePoint ahead of old go, old which does most of its business in just a third of the country Maverick also a regional brand is of course new butt has already achieved a Shear that is substantially higher than Harley held last year, finally style despite new packaging positioning Promotional and field support the sales potential for this brand remains limited as a result style has now been discontinued which will free up resources for other brands, now turning to our competitors will begin with Philip Morris share for this company is up nearly one and a half points or 3% to virtually half of the market gains Trace almost entirely tomorrow bro which has also reached a new Peak and although Philip Morris discount share is declining they're leading generic basic is up, this chart illustrates the importance of Marlboro to Philip Morris relative to all of their other full-price brands as well as their discount segment in 1997 Marlboro has gained more than another to share points and now accounts for 35% of Industry sales and 47 percent of full price volume, of the company's remaining full price Brands Virginia Slims Benson and hedges and Merit are nearly equal in size but all are losing share with Merit off most the last major entry Parliament is just 1/3 the size of the other three brands but has gained shared this year due to the growth of its non mental blocks packing, about a quarter of Marlboros gains are being offset by losses on Philip Morris's discount products however their leading generic and second largest brand basic is up slightly all of the company's other discount entries continue to slide and collectively now account for just four percent of Philip Morris's sales, next Reynolds despite gains for their two most heavily promoted products camel and Doral Reynolds share is down six tenths of a point or two percent all of the company's remaining Brands continue to lose share although the initial impact of Winston's restage has cut losses for that brand, looking first at Reynolds full price segment only camel is showing growth and is now just two tenths of a point away from overtaking Winston as Reynolds leading full price product but both of these brands are currently benefiting from new product efforts in the case of Winston a restaged product claim to be 100% tobacco with no additives was nationally introduced in July of this year, this graph summarizes quarterly share trends for the brand over the past two years and clearly shows the effect of inventory replacement and heavy initial promotional support for the new Winston product during third quarter in fact the Brand's year-to-year share losses have been cut in half by this restage but it remains to be seen whether the no additive positioning will be able to stem Winston's long-term erosion, camel has also been helped by a new introduction in this case two men full box packings which were first shipped in November of 96 as we saw for the new Winston product initial inventory build and promotional volume for Camel Menthol were fairly strong but by the sixth month each of the two new mental packings appeared to have plateaued at less than a tenth of a point, nevertheless camel mental did serve to Triple the Brand's overall 1997 sharing priests, turning to Reynolds discount segment we again see us for Philip Morris only one brand gaining share in this case Durrell but all private labels including Reynolds continue to slide and the importance of the company's remaining generic brands is rapidly dwindling, next Brown & Williamson as you know at the end of last year BMW sold six of the brands they had acquired in their 1995 purchase of American Tobacco to Commonwealth a small company in Kentucky note that for comparability of trend comparisons these brands have been removed from all previous BMW totals, yet even excluding the loss Brands company share is down six tenths of a point or 4% with only GPC showing growth, with in BMWs full to play full price group pool has had the greatest absolute decline but relative to its size it's down about the same rate as most of BMWs other full price products in fact the only BMW full price entry not declining is Capri the ultra-slim female brand which has held share during the past year, within BMW's discount segment GPC is the dominant factor in 1996 this company leader lost share for the first time to turn the brand Trend around BMW introduced GPC medium in July changed its packaging in September and has been aggressively promoting the family with by downs and coupons throughout the year, all of Brandon Williamson's other discount products are declining with lawsuits ranging from just two one-hundredths of a point for Misty another slim female brand like the pre to two tenths of a point for their private labels, lastly we have Liggett who share is declining at the greatest rate down and astounding 28 percent in just one year as a result of this company which is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy now accounts for just over 1% of Industry sales with none of their products showing any growth, looking at liggett's actual shares by Price group we see that their total full price importance on the left has now fallen to less than half a point lick its overall loss however traces primarily to their discount products both generics and private labels which account for three-quarters of the company's business, now combining All Brands let's compare the current relationships of those that are most responsible for industry performance in total the top 10 families now account for over seventy seven percent of Industry sales of three percentage points in just one year, the increasing importance of these Market leaders obviously reflects the commitment of companies to most heavily support those brands with the greatest strength and potential for us that brand is Newport which continues to widen its lead as the number one mental and number two brand overall, this chart Compares year-to-date 1997 versus 96 sure levels and trends for Marlboro the nine remaining top 10 brands and all others here the increasing dominance of Marlborough is most apparent now accounting for more than one out of every three cigarettes sold and continuing to increase share of the remaining nine brands in the top 10 group 5 are also growing with Newport showing the, the greatest absolute gain and thereby widening its lead as the second most popular cigarette in America stepping back just one year this graph summarize chairs of the number two to number five brands from 1995 in yellow to 1996 and orange when Newport leaped past Doral GPC and Winston to capture second place, now adding 1997 we see that Newport continues to grow at a faster rate than either der allergy PC the to Discount brand leaders in contrast number five Winston has suffered ongoing declines and as a result New Port is now one and a half points ahead of this brand which it actually trailed just two years ago to summarize here are the actual 1997 year-to-date chairs and, friends for each of the top five brands, for our growing but relative increases our highest for Marlboro and Newport each up 7%, of the remaining top 10 brands only two are also increasing that is camel whose gain largely reflects introductory volume for its new mental packings and basic which of the three generics and the top 10 group is up the least and therefore has now dropped below camel to Seventh Place, ranking 8th and 9th are Salem and cool Newports most direct competitors these two mental Brands would tick which different share by just for one hundredth of a point are declining at similar rates of five and six percent but Virginia Slims which remains number 10 is nearly holding share, finally let's take a brief look at the mental segment of our industry which is most important to Laurel art in total mental importance is holding at 25% of Industry sales within the Menthol Market only two established brands are showing growth Newport the leader and Marlboro which continues to make inroads into the segment, this chart breaks out current mental shares and Trends versus year ago by Price group generally mental Trends are similar to those seen for the industry overall that is growth for the full price segment relative stability for generics and heavy losses for private labels, looking at cheer levels and trends for key Brands within the growing full price portion of the Menthol category we again see Newport significant growth in sharp contrast to the continued declines for Salem and cool camel of course is new so the only other established full price mental with growth is Marlboro which though just one-fifth the size of Newport has benefited from the Brand's overall momentum, nevertheless based on this picture of Newports performance over the last four years it is clear that this is the brand that remains the most formidable opponent for all mental competitors, this concludes our review of Laurel Arts 1997 sales performance and how it relates to that of the industry and competitive companies by Price segment and brand in summary here is what those comparisons have shown, despite ongoing negative pressures 1997 industry sales are expected to be just slightly below 1996, but while the marketplace in which we compete is still losing volume Laura large sales this year will be approximately 1 billion units higher than last year, looking at full price importance we saw that the turnaround in this segments Trends which began four years ago has continued with 1997 market share up another full point to 73 percent by company this increased races to fill up Mars the full price leader due to its powerful Marlboro brand, but Laurel Arts full price segment is down only because two Brands were repositioned excluding these are full price total would be up as well, in the face of full price share gains the importance of discount products has declined three percent this year with private labels off 20% and branded generics just holding share, but unlike all of the other manufacturers Lords discount share is up due to the successful introduction of Maverick specials and the relative stability of the old gold brand, fiber and six of the top 10 leaders are gaining share, of these rates of growth have been greatest for the top two Marlboro the non-mental leader and Newport the number one Menthol in the country, finally only two companies Philip Morris and lorillard are gaining share and volume overall which is the ultimate measure of success but relative to the size of each Laura large rate of growth is highest, based on these results there is no question that the commitment of everyone in lorillard has continued contributed to a very successful 1997 and given this solid foundation we will enter the coming year in a strong position to meet new challenges and working together take advantage of all the opportunities available to us for continued success thank you thank you,something seemed eternal",0.8613482100917428,0.661857,0.9128387,fpnh0063,,tobacco; cigarette;  <a href='http://www.archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&mediatype=movies&collection=industry-archives'>Browse by keywords

improving the value of the stock and reiterated its commitment to spending off Nabisco when the when the moment is right this moment may have passed but he does still hold at least one card he can call a special shareholder meeting to push management for a spinoff Katherine Barrett CNN financial news New York, it was reported earlier been at le beau today conceded defeat in his six month effort to support of food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco he joins us tonight to talk about his efforts and future plans could have you back that's to be back at this point what what do you blame your defeat on or who do you blame for that defeat I think most of the institutional shareholders didn't quite understand the settlement agreement that we came up with I think it took you know it was, just announced about three weeks ago it's taking time for to filter out the people initially the institution at the institutional investors were at whatever the margin supportive of your efforts then backed away do you feel you just simply failed to explain it because many of them expressed to us today and you saw and Catherine burns report earlier disappointment with the settlement well I think and they don't understand the implications are but you also have the problem of large institutions and we film our stock and rgr stock and the, the feedback and Philip Morris not being you know reflected in the RJR situation so it s times will take time for people to understand I think in time the sun was the right thing to do and we do it again we think that's the right thing do you think that that settlement will be of help absolutely I think it will be approved by the court and will be upheld yes and at the annual shareholders meeting who will be there in your and your place tomorrow Daniel shares mean they gave us two minutes to get up and speak out of anyone going speak for 2 minutes ago, minutes isn't enough for or not not enough to get that get your message across what do you do now you've reached this point this round to RJR Nabisco is management for the you do in the next round well we of course myself and Carl Icahn we only put 90 million shares of stock for the second-largest shareholder here we have a major investment we tend to maximize the investment and as we've been agitating for six months now the way to do that is for the company's spin-off the Biscoe we want the Biscoe spun off and that's still our goal and the man, one of RJR Nabisco so that's their goal as well you have a different time table perhaps a different approach there's do you think that perhaps is the British say you were perhaps too clever by half and reaching that settlement when you did I think the settlement was a right thing at the right time I supported and I continue to support it and I think time will show that we were right in doing the settlement okay why I think it's time for tobacco companies to stop fighting and sit down and settle and there's a lot of talk now a lot of politicians are coming around a lot of riders a lot of, journals are saying maybe we should sit and talk and make a deal I stopped all this legal thing I mean I've are gr and Philip Morris left so much equity on the table here yet Philip Morris have great company is trading in such a way Lou where domestic tobacco comes being valued at zero and our jars trading for two times in our earnings in the back of side one of the things that you didn't up with Philip Morris but with RJ are you did when the right for a shareholders meeting are you going to exercise the right to explore options now, go for it where is Carlos also know the story on seems to have major investment and it's a very support of the whole situation is you know supportive in the last time you and I talked in the midst of this battle we talked a bit of my car but he has not been quoted he's not been at all out in public with you why not because I talk every day I mean she knows everything that's going on he's been supportive supportive of public but I don't know if you have to ask all why I mean he wants to your, his partner I have two generals I guess leading the charge just one and then we kind of started I would be the one to do it it's no I'm the backup person we have ligand where we Now understand the business and did the settlement Carver support of the settlement and agreed all the way through as a principal shareholder of RJR having lost this first battle what do you think is going to unfold what is your plan specifically from here but what can you do the institutional investors have backed away from you at least through this part of the bat, did you say either they don't understand or don't agree with your position in the settlement and its effect on the prices and evaluation what happens now I things up to the management now do something little the stock still 29 7h today the stock is going to going nowhere it's up to management spin-off in the Pisco and do something fun stockholders it's time to let see if what their program is get the stock up where it should be this dock is greatly undervalued now it's Management's term to do something the short term, I'm okay little bo major investor and RJR Nabisco and as the saying goes he isn't going away let's go",0.8186381418750001,0.7446154,0.89025635,fqwc0072,,tobacco; cigarette;<a

frgp0190,"mr. Coleman some serious charges have been raised on the floor of the Senate and even in the tobacco publication but the tobacco companies are organizing to thwart the ban on broadcast advertising of cigarettes now we understand a meeting has been called to discuss this problem can you tell us about it and whether you plan to attend, I can tell you about the meeting I do not plan to attend that meeting will be attended by chairman of the Federal Communication Commission the president of tobacco Institute in the president of the National Association of broadcasters and the purpose of the meeting I gather is to try to clarify the a new law which reflects the fact that cigarette advertising will be off the air we volunteered to go off the air we plan to be off the air, we agreed to do this the law provides it we plan to adhere to the spirit and the letter of the law we're not going to advertise cigarettes on the air, from CVS Washington in color Face the Nation a spontaneous and unrehearsed news interview with Joseph Coleman third chairman and chief executive officer of Philip Morris Incorporated and chairman of the executive committee of the tobacco Institute mr. Coleman will be questioned by early avel science editor of wcbs-tv News New York Morton mints of the Washington Post and CBS News correspondent George Herman, mr. Coleman as you know some of these charges that certain cigarette companies plan to try to sneak in some hidden advertising so to speak of there is any such thing are so serious that as I gather the chairman of the FCC has called this meeting do you think that no one is planning to sneak in a little commercial here and there on the corner of the camera well this question has come up recently of course many of these sporting events have been sponsored by cigarette companies for a number of years it's not a, new development and it's been known that they were going to sponsor these events for at least nine months I would say that I am confident in the Integrity of the other President's chief executive officer of the other companies I do not feel I'm confident they are not going to subvert the law and are going to try to circumvent the law what we need here is clarification the law says cigarette advertising will be off the air and cigarette advertising will be off for you what, leave a meeting with the dean Birch will concern itself with is the question of clarification this is a new law and we need clarification I think the broadcaster's need clarification and apparently the Federal Communication Commission is going to help us in this matter but I'd like to say that many of the articles that have appeared in the Press I feel are misleading the companies are very sincere they're law-abiding and they're going to abide by the law, well I have no doubt that you're abiding by the law literally but say if your company sponsored is a Virginia Slims tennis tournament an Invitational for women tennis players isn't that really an effort to get around the intent and spirit of the law which is to stop as I understand it the the spirit is to stop the use of the airwaves to promote cigarette smoking, well that's a good question is two men so I would say to know the purpose for our sponsoring Virginia Slims Invitational tournaments is to help the ladies antennas to to get a chance to to get prize money and to show their prowess before a lot of people in the areas where they're playing the tennis matches their there is no plan to telecast these tournaments and let's just on premise promotion in the areas, they're going to have the tournaments and we plan to adhere to the spirit and the letter of the law these tournaments have not been telecast now for example we've been sponsoring the US Open tennis championship at Forest Hills for a number of years we think that people have appreciated that sponsorship we won't be able to sponsor it in terms of television commercials in the future but our sponsorship of sporting events will continue without television exposure, you're our company makes a number of other products besides cigarettes do you have any plans for example to increase the amount of are advertising broadcast advertising for those products which may bear shall we say name resemblance or a look resemblance the cigarettes, well that's been raised too many times we don't happen to have any such product we're also in other businesses such as chewing gum and dear I'm not going to mention the products I would say that no there is no intention the will be no intention to subvert the Lord to circumvent the law and I feel absolutely confident that this will not be done by my company and I feel just as confident won't be done by the other coming but I cannot speak for them today not particular area I'm glad, brought that up because I think this brings me to another point that I do want to make the relates to that question we have tried to be responsible and responsive we have been responsible in many ways over the years we've discontinued all campus promotion activities when this was brought to our attention is being not appropriate we have discontinued advertising and college newspapers we have discontinued the use of celebrities the use of sporting figures in our advertising, and the use of testimonials by them further than that we volunteered to go off the air which was a very big move to attempt to clear the air so we have shown I think responsibility and we have been responsive we are also very concerned about the charges leveled against our product and we're very anxious to do whatever we can to clear the air in this manner we happen to be optimistic about the future and we happen to feel that this is a great industry and the business industry, can face the future with confidence because when as an if any ingredient and cigarette smoke is identified as being injuries to human health we are confident that we can eliminate that ingredient before we get into the medical aspect which I think now you're leading us into I just want to finish off on the advertising question are you not involved in a lawsuit to test the constitutionality of this law Banning broadcast advertising the tobacco Institute or your company no one not the mr. Herman I'll, I think you're referring to the question of the fairness Doctrine yes out of Communication Commission that relates to the question the fairness Doctrine was invoked by the Federal Communication Commission and they required that all broadcasters are and e-cigarette messages without charge and approximately a percentage of 123 regular cigarette commercials now that we're off the air the Federal Communication Commission has ruled this is no longer a controversial and hence, broadcasters who are an e-cigarette messages do not have to are the rebuttal by the tobacco industry but the Federal Communication Commission went on to say that the stations may do this the issue here is whether if and e-cigarette messages are aired by stations after the cigarette commercials go off the air don't think tobacco companies have a right to rebut and answer the question under, to the fairness Doctrine if it was a fairness Doctrine you personally then are satisfied that this ruling of a products advertising illegal products advertising off of some media of advertising and not off of others is a constitutional and fair within the law process within the powers of the Congress well we volunteer to do this understand I'm just questioning of the legality well the legality of something that I don't think I'm qualified to pass on here I will say that the Congress passed the law it has not been tested, stood yet from a constitutional standpoint is being tested I think you may also be referring to a suit brought by a number of radio companies for us that was not bought brought by the cigarette industry mr. Coleman now that you'd not advertising on, on radio and television you can have a little bit money left over I think in your company something like 30 million dollars a year perhaps for the industry as a whole quarter of a billion you can use that money for example to do more research to settle the health question the research is going to get a certain an expanded amount of mind that that matter comes up all the time that's subject what are we going to do with the extra money, are we well what are you going to do with this well I can only speak for my company and what I believe the other companies will do of course this is a very competitive business we will continue to spend money for promotional purposes and some of it will go and print some will go and point of sale somewhere going on premises promotions we will be spending it on an expanded sales forth but a lot will go into expanded research and the desire to get the answers to these questions what is a loss what percentage of your advertising, using budget for example there is a question that I anticipated I don't know how to answer that question if they're so different items when you try to get a message through to 200 million Americans 65 million smokers and you compare that figure to a figure for research this is a very difficult figure to come up with I have to know roughly what our company is going to spend I think it's a large for you we are, building right now a whole new Research Center in Richmond we are expanding we have been expanding our commitment to research both product research product improvements and research in the area of smoking and health I'm just trying to put it in proportion because the figures is I've been able to get them and they're kind of mixed up in the facts and different standards but as I've been a is mirrors I've been able to figure out it's about 1% or less of the advertising budgets that is that is not not true mr. Herman I would say that in, 81 something in the area of of a half to a third will go into research compared to our advertising for your company or for tobacco hospital because big the tobacco industry advertising come to like 250 million a year and you would you like failures have been reduced to two hundred million all right would you think half of that 100 million a year is going into research no I wouldn't say that for the I can't speak for the other companies I'm talking overall research product research product and provide health resort in health research, but I want to say this that I've been advised for a number of years of problem here is not funds the problem is Direction confidence and trying to find out what do we want to ascertain how do we want to assert a right well I'll go look Morton is straining at the bit here but not one question of that that I would like to ask one of the most controversial of the recent experiments has been the one of the smoking Vehicles who were forced by a hole cut in their throat to smoke cigarettes smoke and came up with a number of, cancers neoplasms growths tumors all different kinds of words to describe it the problem that that I come up with is this it was immediately jumped upon by the tobacco Institute and thoroughly denounced for various reasons some of which is since evaporated I understand some of which have not my question is this how many dogs or laboratory animals have comfortable size has the tobacco Institute financed experimentation of that kind on how many vehicles have you had smoking we've had animal and Elation test, on all over the world not sponsored only by the tobacco industry but sponsored by independent research actor for over 25 years and I might say that these tests have always been - they have never been able to induce lung cancer in animals due to inhalation of cigarette smoke and I would like to comment on that our backgammon reporter this is a very important development that was announced as you may recall on February 5th at a press conference the waldorf-astoria hotel, as a major breakthrough is the first time that a major animal had indeed been induced to get lung cancer from smoking cigarettes outside of map, outside of man that is correct animal I believe I said I also want to say that, a charge was level not only against Out product but a claim is made of the cigarette industry as the result of these experiments should assess its advertising policies and its overall policy this was a serious charge against our industry and we were astounded frankly after 25 years of negative results to find that the American Cancer Society could come up with this result, so we directed a letter to the Kansas side of we directed four letters to that we were also surprised that this procedure the Press coverage of the waldorf-astoria hotel because normally on a matter of this consequence, the medical profession goes through the discipline of submitting it to a medical journal it's then either accepted or rejected by the journal and this gives it a much more appropriate foundation for accuracy we thought in view of the charges made against our product and the fact that we were asked to reassess our policies that we were entitled for an independent review of the of the facts the slides methodology and whether or not goodness, it was really good research the Cancer Society refused to let us do this, even the New York Times supporters in this particular Endeavor they said that the can study should let us do this and finally we understood that the paper the Outback Hammond paper was submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Association this was after it had been turned down by the New England medical journal we were very interested I think we ought explain why it was turned on by the New England Journal it was turned down simply because it had been released ahead of time that was a policy doesn't that indicate this was not, proper procedure but it in no way reflects on the accuracy or enact no I didn't mean to imply that I'd like to say further that the Journal of the American Medical Association submitted this paper to 18 reviewers 17 of 18 review is rejected the paper and was sent back for major revisions now on the day of that submission when we finally found that out these gentlemen appeared in Chicago, and we found their position had been materially changed we also found their position had been maturely changed when we finally did get hold of a document in its final form as accepted by The Archives and of environmental health Minister Yuval I will I will tell you that but I believe you know that but I will say that as I see it, originally the our bank Hammond reports stated that for the first time and a major experimental animal, lung cancer had indeed been induced by cigarettes, and they claim that 12 dogs got cancerous tumors, in the final paper that was appeared in The Archives of environmental health they no longer claim with the purpose of the experiment was to determine whether cigarette smoke could induced lung cancer and bagels and they'll oh no longer claim that they did get those results are no longer claim that they got lung cancer from smoking cigarettes those are two very major changes and they reduce the number of doors, goes from 12 dogs to two dogs and I am still challenging the Cancer Society I have a letter on the record asking them to demonstrate to us whether or not those two dogs did indeed get Logan's on that point I happen to have a paper here which paper the one that finally appeared on the archives of environmental health and they refer to 12 dogs dogs who have invasive lung tumors two of which were identified, defied of carcinoma and the rest or invasive lung tumors invasive lung tumors does not mean lung cancers it is a matter of small Comfort to that difference well there are many tumors that can be developed in many people and we try to face it, that I wouldn't existence would you like to have an invasive lung tumor I don't believe so I don't think you would but that does not mean it's lung cancer no that's not what they say they will measure with to do it do it Chu was developed in the dog that didn't smoke that's in that report to non-invasive tool to non-invasive non invasive tumors that's a technicality I don't really feel confident that an invasive tumor is one which leaves the site which it originates and goes, to other tissues joining that site now these were invasive lovely thank Hoover Orton thing here is the dead change they did not claim as the originally claimed that they got any lung cancers from smoking cigarette you'll note if you read that carefully it does not claim that even if they were invasive lung tumors and even if that is undesirable thing which apparently it sounds like today this was no this is not claim to be the result, of cigarette smoking that's clearly omitted from their final report just common don't agree with that it seems to me that the statement says that not only is it associated with smoking but that it is less in dogs who smoked filter cigarettes it's related associated with smoking Mr Hammond does not mean, a lot of things that may be associated with a lot of things wrong I've been reporting science for a long time and it takes a great deal of information to establish what a Layman would consider to be a cause-and-effect relationship but I would say this that a scientist and his care generally says associated with and if you feel that cigarette smoking being associated with invasive lung tumors is not a Cause, well that's your opinion let's come around like you exhale us all from the lungs for for a couple of minutes and why one quick one and then I want to get to an area involving the promotion of cigarettes to women in an ad that you ran a newspapers December 1 I believe you said that you had spent 35 million dollars to support independent research I'd like to know whether you've ever spent anything the industry I say you want to help, those millions of people I believe there are millions I can't prove it who would like to quit smoking and who may be told by their doctors that they better quit smoking what are you spending on ways to finding ways to make tobacco tobacco cigarette smoking less addictive, well those are really two questions I think this immense as you quiz we have no program that I know of to try to help people to stop smoking we do talk to the question of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous we do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous we don't accept that but we are working with the government working very very hard with the government and various methods of ascertaining whether or not cigarettes, can be found to be hazardous you believe that cigarettes are safe and they've been proved to be Satan's to come I believe they have not been proved to be unsafe while in view of the fact that they haven't been proved to be safe what does it justification that you would offer for spending according to one estimate I've seen three billion dollars in the last 20 years to promote their use when there's that uncertainty when we have an excess excess deaths of 200,000 to 300,000 a year when there's all this, evidence which you don't feel as conclusive what is the reason for promoting its use when it might, cause cancer heart disease and so forth well I'd have to answer that This Woman's to answer a great many people in the United States and all over the world who would enjoy smoking who find it satisfies a very important human need, we think that those people are entitled to the best possible products that we can produce that is essentially our job and what we now embryos don't have much Choice fetuses don't they don't like to smoke the British medical research council did a study of all of the 17,000 babies born in a single week in the United Kingdom as you doubtless know the council found that those, babies born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy we're in significantly higher proportion small weighing under five and a half pounds approximately then the babies born to mothers who did not smoke and there was a higher rate of stillbirths and of deaths within 28 days of birth the question is in view of this study which is the largest and most elaborate of its kind ever made is it right, to promote smoking among women with Virginia Slims and the other brands especially marketed for them with no warning as to the danger of the embryo that may exist you're reading that question that goes it's a complicated question and I would say that I did read that report and I concluded from that report that it's true the baby's born from women who smoke are smaller but they're just as healthy as the baby's born from women who do not smoke, some women would prefer having smaller babies that I don't I don't know if familiar with that mr. Coleman every book on pharmacology identifies nicotine as a drug and with regard to the use of any drug it makes little difference as far as pharmacological definition is concerned whether you injected inhale it sniff it what take it by mouth, now under the laws of this country a manufacturer of a drug has the duty and obligation to prove that it's safe now only to prove that it's safe but to prove that it's efficacious namely that it does what it's supposed to do if indeed cigarettes are drugs within the meaning of the pharmacological turns if not the legal terms isn't it incumbent upon the cigarette companies to prove without exception that cigarettes are safe and not to Simply say prove that it's dangerous, well I think mr. you built this case your premise is wrong I really have to refer to the surgeon general's advisory committee report that report stated categorically the cigarettes are not addictive I didn't say that they were addicted I said that nicotine is a drug within the meaning of a term of drug in a chemically they went it's more important for the industry to take the word of the surgeon general's committee they said that cigarettes are not addicted I didn't talk about addiction, said that nicotine is a drug that means that it is a chemical which when taken into the body produces physiological changes whether it's a dick of a not as another property I'm talking about its being a girl here again the surgeon general's committee largely exonerated nicotine is a health hazard of any consequence to the public I have to glean on that after all the surgeon general's committee met for 9 months or longer and they can they concluded that nicotine is not a hazard to help do you have any problem in leaning on the, the surgeon general's report in some directions and denying it another directions no I don't frankly have about two minutes left Surgeon General report concluded that smoking is a health hazard of sufficient consequence to take appropriate remedial action and the Congress has responded to that but I want to remind you that the Congress in its premise in its preamble to the, law that bans cigarette advertising stated that in order to inform the public that cigarette smoking may be hazardous to health the following law is enacted I also want to say an answer to mr. you bail and mr. Mintz they've asked me some very searching questions I hate this popped out you guys me some very intelligent Grand a 13-foot I just want to say that, at the surgeon the surgeon general's report made of candy with certain certain conclusion that is true but there are many other developments subsequent of that and we had these, hearings for almost two weeks before the Congressional Committee of the house 14 days eminent scientists appeared on both sides that Committee of the Congress decided that there is nothing new in the smoking and health relationship since the hearings of 65 accepted both sides are supported by a larger statistical base and that's our opinion, I have about 20 seconds left you have two grandsons I believe we're at least two grandchildren at what age will you encourage them to start smoking cigarettes I wouldn't encourage them to start smoking cigarettes up to them okay thank you very much for being with us here today thank you mr.

fsph0257,"hello my name is dr. Jeff Gordon I'm the director of pain management and palliative care at the angle would hospital and Medical Center in Englewood New Jersey and also a clinical instructor of anesthesiology at the Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai I want to welcome you to our program entitled evolving rolls same goals the changing landscape of pain management, judgment, before we get started I'd like to take this opportunity to have our faculty introduce themselves dr. Hargrove why don't you start us off, I'm Charles our golf professor of Neurology at Albany Medical College and director of the Comprehensive Pain Center at Albany Medical Center in Albany New York, dr. arkov will present how a multi-faceted approach can help address opioid abuse and dr. Michael are Brandon will discuss developing abuse deterrent opioids dr. Brennan I'm Michael Brennan I'm the medical director and chief medical officer of the pain center of Fairfield and Fairfield Connecticut I'm also associate medical director for the chronic pain and Recovery Center at Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan Connecticut I also want to let you our audience know that this program was developed by Teva, articles that the three of us are presenting on behalf of Teva and that we've been compensated by Teva to give this presentation over the course of this program we will discuss some of the issues we all deal with on a day-to-day basis when managing pain specifically we'll take a look at treatment options focusing on opioids as we all know opioids are used to treat pain but abuse can occur as such it's important that we as clinicians understand when and how to use them, we will also examine a multi-faceted approach to addressing issues associated with opioids and how Healthcare professionals patients and the government can also play a role finally we'll take a look at how the development of abuse deterrent opioids may play a role in this multifaceted methodology taking information from the 2015 FDA guidance on this topic, I would like to begin this program by talking about some of those day-to-day challenges of practitioner May face when it comes to pain management chronic pain constitutes a significant medical need in the United States we recognize that patients are living longer with chronic illnesses surviving their trauma or cancer and as a result may also be experiencing chronic pain, we know that chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans and cost this country a significant amount of money estimated at over 600 billion dollars annually in direct costs and lost productivity and we know that there's a cost to patients as well that chronic pain May impair routine activities, now we know there are a few choices for analgesic medications and opioid analgesics represent an important tool in our treatment Arsenal, unfortunately with the expanding use of opioid analgesics an epidemic of prescription opioid abuse has resulted one of the challenges for those of us who treat pain patients has been how to utilize these important analgesics safely and effectively and what we recognize is that there is no simple solution a multi-faceted approach is needed to make sure that pain management is adequately provided to patients who need it while we also deal with the issues such as abuse misuse, use and diversion of these substances we have developed strategies to deal with opioid abuse most notably focused around educating the many parties involved the pharmaceutical industry has also stepped up and is trying to play a role in preventing the misuse and abuse of prescription analgesic medications one way that they have done this is through the development of abuse deterrent formulations for opioids, and any time we treat pain patients as clinicians we need to recognize the balance in our treatments, so we have to provide patients with adequate analgesia but minimize the Adverse Events associated with those medications and not just the physiological adverse effects but also the adverse effects of opioid abuse misuse and or diversion, I mentioned before that opioids are certainly an important analgesic option for pain management this has been recognized over time if you look at this chart starting in the early 1990s taking us up to 2013 you could see that there has been a slow yet Progressive increase in the amount of opioids dispensed by retail pharmacies in the United States again this has to do with our improved abilities to assess pain and our willingness to treat chronic pain with, a treatment regimen that includes opioids unfortunately the greater volume of opioid analgesics has also resulted in issues related to misuse abuse and diversion of these important analgesics, Beyond increased misuse and diversion there has also been an increase in deaths due to drug overdose, as you can see in this chart prescription opioids outrank both heroin and cocaine combined as a cause of drug overdose deaths here in the United States, looking at the slope of these curves you see that drug overdose deaths due to prescription opioid use has outpaced heroin and cocaine over the last 10 years or so highlighting the need to develop strategies to prevent prescription opioid misuse and abuse David fish beIN a psychiatrist and Pain Management specialist from the University of Miami conducted an evidence-based review of The Chronic pain literature focusing on patients with non-cancer and, ligament pain who were receiving chronic opioid analgesic therapy he looked at 67 different studies that evaluated the abuse or addiction rate aberrant drug related behaviors and urine toxicology testing and what he found is that only three point two seven percent of patients being treated with chronic opioid therapy had a high likelihood of abuse or addiction with their opioid analgesics, most notably he found that 25 times lower rate of abuse or Addiction in patients who didn't have a prior history of abuse or addiction, this is an important data set for us to recognize that the risk is clearly greater in patients with a previous history of abuse or addiction and that it's relatively low for patients with chronic non-malignant pain who don't have a previous history of addiction we all know that the most common initial source of opioids for non-medical use comes from a friend or family member for free but as the frequency of non-medical use increases the opioid becomes more likely to, I'm from a clinician highlighting the need for us to educate and reinforce to our patients how to use their medication appropriately, this brings us to the end of our discussion on some of the complexities clinicians face in pain management and I hope you found this chapter informative please return to the main menu and select the next chapter to hear dr. our golf tell you more about the role that clinicians and others can play in addressing opioid abuse,I'm Charles our golf professor of Neurology at Albany Medical College and director of the Comprehensive Pain Center at Albany Medical Center in Albany New York in the previous chapter you heard dr. Jeff Gordon discuss some of the challenges we faced with balancing the need for Effective pain management with some of the dangers of prescription opioid use to continue this conversation I'll focus on how we can help address opioid abuse with a, OT faceted approach, there are many approaches to mitigate opioid abuse and I would like to divide them into three main buckets first its education that ensures clinicians understand how to screen monitor and manage patients appropriately with opioid therapy this can also be combined with patient education on adherence to a treatment regimen as well as appropriate storage and disposal of opioids, second is the availability and use of tools that can help us guide the approach to managing a person an opioid therapy for example prescription drug monitoring programs which have been developed in almost every state help us as clinicians see what Controlled Substances our patients are currently being prescribed we have also had scheduling changes regarding certain opioids we have risk evaluation and mitigation strategies or Rems programs to help us guard against opioid, abuse changes to opioid labeling and guidance from the FDA on developing abuse deterrent formulations, the FDA guidance outlines how abuse to turn properties can be tested and what statements the FDA might allow in a product's package insert based on study results, it's important to recognize that there are multiple stakeholders who are involved in addressing opioid abuse and it is necessary for there to be a collaborative approach among these groups these groups include Healthcare professionals who are currently involved in managing patient care the patients themselves state and federal government entities as well as industry to promote safe and effective pain management we can incorporate a multi-faceted approach among all parties to, noise and mitigate the risks associated with opioid use, Healthcare Providers can play a role by following universal precautions incorporating screening strategies and monitoring patient adherence to prescription opioids some of the elements of universal precautions are outlined here and include establishing a diagnosis incorporating the use of a treatment agreement periodic pain assessments reviewing the diagnosis and of course ensuring appropriate documentation, in terms of screening there are various instruments that we can use as Healthcare Providers to identify the risk of opioid abuse in our patients and some of them are listed here we also have adherence monitoring approaches State specific prescription drug monitoring programs provide us with some insight into the use of opioids by a particular patient but these may vary widely between states, random drug screens are important random urine drug screens may be a way of confirming or evaluating adherence for the people to whom we prescribe medications as is pill counting to see whether it appears at the person who are prescribing the medication to is actually using it in a way that we have prescribed it and is adhering to that regimen, keep in mind even though we might consider any of our patients to be low risk for opioid abuse no patient has zero risk as health care providers we are the front line against opioid abuse and as such we need to use multiple methods to support safe and effective use of the treatments we prescribe, the patient has responsibilities as well which we can help through patient education for example we can help the patient understand how to safely use store and dispose of opioids from a safe use point of view we can encourage our patients to take their medications as prescribed to understand the risks associated with chronic opioid therapy and to be aware of inappropriate use and its consequences from a safe storage point of view, we don't want a person's opioid therapy to be accessible to their children or other family members just a single dose can be very dangerous as someone who is not supposed to be using an opioid analgesic so opioids should be locked or hidden to avoid access by family or friend and of course our patients need to know never to share their opioids with others because again a single dose can be regrettably but real, Stickley catastrophic with respect to adverse outcomes including death, safe disposal is also very important there are an increasing number of community sponsored take-back programs so opioids in a particular community may be disposed of through this approach and if that's not available the office of drug control National policy recommendations have been established and can be accessed to allow for an environmentally friendly disposal approach to these medications, so what exactly is a prescription drug monitoring program or pdmp for short, by definition it is a Statewide electronic database and it is designed to collect data on substances dispensed in that particular state it is housed within a designated state agency so could be a regulatory administrative or law enforcement agency this may vary from state to state and it's accessible only by authorized Personnel what are the potential benefits well this is a program that allows us to see what Controlled Substances a, Pacific patient may be receiving in that state and in that way it helps to support legitimate access to controlled substances, pdmps may also be able to help identify and deter drug abuse and diversion they may be able to facilitate identification and treatment of those addicted to prescription drugs by detecting certain patterns which can be very helpful in cases where addiction is not obvious they also allow you to establish it you will be monitoring every patients opioid use patterns, they may provide use and abuse data to support Public Health efforts to help educate all of us especially our patients on how to effectively use medications and how we can all play a role in limiting abuse and hopefully reduce diversion, as you see Missouri is the only state currently without an enacted prescription drug monitoring program and most other states have an operational prescription drug monitoring program pdmps vary state by state but in general they are all constructed to help clinicians understand how patients use prescription opioids which may then impact are prescribing Behavior, this can be used to help reduce Doctor shopping and to promote greater transparency it's also fair to say that the full benefit of prescription drug monitoring programs will not be reached until all states Implement data sharing and interoperability between each other to ensure transparency of opioid use across state lines, those of you with patients on Medicaid may be aware of its lock-in program which provides some ideas on how to limit abuse as well, federal law allows Medicaid to restrict patients who over utilize Medicaid services to designated providers it does so by requiring a patient to be seen by one health care provider and obtain their prescriptions from a single Pharmacy, the purpose of this is to empower a single provided to coordinate care to reduce doctor and Pharmacy shopping to limit drug diversion and to reduce Health Care utilization and Pharmacy cost, in the future this model may be adopted by other governmental payers be on Medicaid and even by private insurers as well to accomplish the same goals, as we alluded to earlier Controlled Substances scheduling of opioids can also help address prescription opioid abuse as you know the lower the number the higher the potential for abuse and dependence hydrocodone products were rescheduled from schedule 3 to schedule to in late 2014 which makes the process of obtaining a prescription and refills somewhat more difficult, the US Food and Drug Administration has also established a series of steps designed to help reduce opioid related risks and these are known collectively as opioid risk evaluation and mitigation strategies or Rems, they include the establishment of a medication guide or patient package inserts, a communication plan one or more elements to assure safe use and implementation system and a timetable for reporting the rims assessments to see if these strategies have been effective or not, Rems programs differ by opioid class for example immediate release opioids do not require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program / FDA guidelines the trans mucosal immediate-release fentanyl products or turst do involve a Rams program and practitioner and manufacturer participation is mandatory with access restricted to prescribers who have completed certain educational activities and have scored successfully on, an examination, in other words not everyone with a DEA number can prescribe these medications there has to be an additional set of educational activity before that can happen, with extended release and long-acting opioid therapy participation in the Rems program is not mandatory for the practitioner and access is not restricted to prescribers who have fulfilled certain criteria, the federal government through the FDA can also change what's in the package insert of a product here you see some changes in the package inserts of extended-release opioids that were implemented in 2013 as you can see the indication itself for extended release and long-acting opioids has changed in two ways the first change specifies that extended release or long-acting opioids are indicated for management of pain severe enough, to require daily around-the-clock long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatments are inadequate the second chain states that these agents should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options for example non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids are ineffective not tolerated or otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain there are also post marketing studies the FDA, now requires the FDA specifically is requiring new studies to further assess the known serious risks of misuse abuse and increase into tivity to pain sometimes known as hyperalgesia addiction overdose and death finally there is also a new box warning that states quote chronic maternal use of these products during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome or now's close quote, to summarize we need to really consider a multi-faceted approach to addressing opioid abuse the key stakeholders in this multifaceted approach include Healthcare Providers patients government as well as industry as we discussed healthcare provider strategies for mitigating opioid abuse include universal precautions screening for drug abuse and abuse risk urine testing and adherence monitoring, patients should also be educated specifically on the methods and importance of safe use safe storage and safe disposal of opioids, the federal and state government have developed and continue to develop programs aimed at making opioid diversion and abuse more difficult and less likely including the use of prescription drug monitoring programs the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy programs or Rams and labeling changes I hope you enjoyed this chapter the program and better understand the role that Health Care Providers patients and the government play in a multi-faceted abuse mitigation strategy, she industry may play a role in helping mitigate opioid abuse to tell you a little more about this and the potential role of abuse deterrent opioids please watch the final chapter in this series presented by dr. Michael Brennan,I'm Michael Brennan and I'm the medical director and chief medical officer of the pain center of Fairfield and Fairfield Connecticut I'm also associate medical director for the chronic pain and Recovery Center at Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan Connecticut, over the previous chapters in this program you heard about some of the issues associated with opioid use and how Healthcare Providers patients and the government can help reduce risks associated with opioid therapy now I'm going to tell you about the potential role that the pharmaceutical industry might play in mitigating opioid abuse specifically through the development of abuse deterrent opioids, you'll see that there are seven General approaches that have been recognized by the FDA as categories of abuse deterrent opioids these include physical chemical barriers Agonist antagonist combinations a version substances added to the analgesic delivery system characteristics new molecular entities and prodrugs combination approaches and novel approaches regardless of the different approaches to these formulations keep in, that all of these products share one important commonality when the medication is taken as directed or intended the opioid works like a medication that does not include abuse to turn properties it's only when the formulation is tampered with that the abuse to turn properties become evidence so that's the technical issue right creating a drug that will work for pain but at the same time making it difficult for somebody to want to abuse that drug, or make abusing the drug less beneficial, so where does the industry get their guidance there was a guiding principle document that was published by the FDA in April 2015 I'm going to provide you with an overview of what's contained within the guidance for developing abuse deterrent opioid formulations, there are four study categories that can be used to assess the potential abuse to turn properties of an opioid and as we get into the types of abuse to turn Technologies it'll become clear that certain Technologies may meet one type of study and prove beneficial but not necessarily a different type the first group of studies our laboratory manipulation and extraction studies these determine if tampering with the drug can override the formulation and provide a, access to the unadulterated opioid the next a pharmacokinetic studies these studies look at how the abuse to turn properties exert an effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug and after the drug has been manipulated in the lab if there is an alteration in that pharmacokinetic profile, examples of such alterations may include changes in BIO availability of the drug or changes to Peak plasma concentration the third type of test is the clinical abuse potential study, these are studies that look to see how attractive or light by recreational drug users the drug is in its unaltered and Altered States finally and perhaps the greatest hurdle will be the post Market studies has there been a demonstrable reduction in abuse based upon the availability of a certain drug in the market as you can imagine it's going to take several years to determine if there has been an effect, now there are different categories of labeling statements that may be proposed for the package insert and these depend on the results of the studies conducted, let's look carefully at the manipulation studies that have been outlined by the FDA the goal of this type of study is to see through physical or chemical manipulation if a drug can be easily extracted from the formulation, these studies look at particle size and determine if a small enough particle of active drug can be extracted through the various methods including crushing grinding hammering chemical reactions and changing temperature in other words think of whatever a closet chemist might try to do to get that active drug out of the delivery system let me emphasize this again remember the molecules were using are the same 13 or so molecules that are available in the, United States that are deemed opioid analgesics so it's not the molecule itself that's being evaluated what we're looking at are the formulations carrying those molecules can those formulations protect and make it so the drug is more difficult to be used in ways other than intended and the studies also include is I mention solubility studies and we're trying to Target three specific means of abuse snorting smoking and injecting, why are these three the types mentioned by the FDA because these are the approaches more often linked to substance abuse and addiction, the second type of study that I mentioned earlier PK studies so for those of you who can remember back to medical school pharmacokinetics look at how a drug acts in the system by looking at plasma concentration so we're interested in looking at maximum plasma concentration the time to reach this maximum the total area under the curve a relevant partial area under the curve which we think is very important in substance abuse that is how quickly does the drug get absorbed and watch the terminal elimination half, if life was very important in these trials is to try and understand if manipulation of the drug has an effect on the rate of Rise of drug concentration we want to determine if other substances benign substances food alcohol water other common Solutions such as soda might affect the way the drug is ultimately absorbed and also collect Adverse Events let's take a look at what are known in the guidance as C AP or clinical abuse, initial studies these are what we use to refer to as the human abuse liability potential of a drug measured in a way that many clinicians find interesting this involves exposing recreational non-dependent individuals to the opioid formulation using well-controlled studies so people who aren't physically dependent on an opioid but we'll use them recreationally and have enough experience to understand what the normal high of an opioid would feel like, and what the subjects are asked to do is tell us how much they like the drug so they're given a visual analog scale similar to this bipolar scale on a slide where the individual is asked after being exposed to the drug how much they like it or dislike it and they're ask questions questions that you and I won't ask in our clinics I mean we may ask our patients about Adverse Events but here we're trying to tease out different information from these recreational drug abusers and then the all-important question, kitchen How likely are you to use this drug if you can get it, the fourth category describes post-market studies to be conducted in order to examine if a formulation is likely to decrease abuse in the community the goals are to try and provide estimates of how the drug is being abused whether it's being snorted or injected and has this formulation demonstrated a reduction in abuse these studies require sufficient numbers to determine whether or not there is a real or an artificial affect and as such study populations, you're going to have to be carefully selected to Target real-world abusers comparators will also be looked at to see if changes are due to the formulation or other factors like educational programs or changes in law enforcement there will also likely be other opioid comparators as part of these studies, now that we've reviewed the studies that may be conducted to test and abuse deterrent opioid formulation let's switch gears and look at some of the different approaches perhaps the most common form of abuse to turn is the crush resistant pill in capsules all of these have in common a process that makes it very difficult to crush the pill or as we see in the bottom right picture on this slide a pill that if crushed becomes a viscous or gelatinous substance that's very difficult if not impossible to draw up in a syringe or to snort, here we see a different approach which is the use of Agonist antagonist combinations for example in a medication with a sequestered opioid antagonist core the antagonist will only be released if the formulation is manipulated with any of these strategies we have to remember that no technology can completely prevent abuse only time will tell if these Technologies are successful in helping to deter abuse in summary different approaches to opioid deterrence, continue to evolve this is a very exciting science and a very exciting time to offer our patients drugs that may make the abuse of their drugs more difficult it will take time to work through the testing especially for post-market studies but as these studies are completed and reviewed by the FDA abuse to turn opioids may be able to include language in their package inserts to let clinicians know what effect the formulation is likely to have on abuse and abuse potential which will ultimately help us make better informed, form decisions for our patients, thank you for watching this chapter on the development of abuse the turn opioids if you haven't already please be sure to return to the main menu to watch the other

fxxb0079,"new smokeless cigarettes have already been the focus of criticism but now the controversy has a new egg it produces the the pleasure and and what the smoker wants from a cigarette without burning tobacco Premier is nothing more than a sophisticated mechanism for delivering a highly addictive drug in that snake to nicotine good evening I'm Ted Koppel and this is Nightline r.j. Reynolds is, prepared to spend up to a billion dollars to develop and Market smokeless cigarettes now government researchers say smokeless cigarettes can be used to ingest crack and should be banned we'll hear from both sides of this new battle in the smoking War tonight, this is ABC News Nightline reporting from Washington Ted Koppel r.j. Reynolds has not made it this far in the world of Commerce by deliberately flushing huge sums of money down the toilet so one must assume that they have expectations for their new almost smokeless cigarettes that are not immediately apparent to the untrained eye this is for one thing the first pack of cigarettes I've ever encountered, with its own pamphlet of instructions on the back it warns you not to smoke these cigarettes if they are bent crushed or damaged it concedes that you can light them with matches but equality butane lighter is recommended and current lighters it warns don't work the rest of the pamphlets suggests implies but never says that this is a safer cigarette the Surgeon General of the United States is unconvinced he calls it a drug delivery system that should be regulated by, by the federal government and that phrase drug delivery system apparently applies on more than one level we'll get to that shortly first a little background on how we have come to this from Nightline correspondent Judd Rose, sending the message was a lot easier when smoking was in step with Society in those days we were told that smoking man was manly Viceroy the thinking man's filter and the Smoking Man of taste we were told that smoking was romantic with the use of living if you know easy it is to keep a man happy why not give your husband a carton of Philip Morris cigarettes we were even supposed to think smoking was good for us when you change too far, all right you will feel better did you say I'll feel better smoking Philip Morris what America grew skeptical as evidence mounted linking cigarettes with disease and death these days smoking is unfashionable and in many cases flat-out illegal so now the tobacco industry wants to sell us the smokeless cigarette all other cigarettes burnt tobacco this cigarette Premier does not it produces the the, pleasure and and and what the smoker wants from a cigarette without burning tobacco it merely Heats tobacco six years in the making developed and marketed at what's expected to cost 1 billion dollars tobacco giant r.j. Reynolds is hoping this is the future of cigarettes but even if there's no smoke there's plenty of fire Premier is nothing more than a sophisticated mechanism for delivering a highly addictive drug in that snake to nicotine it is also a mechanism by which others, liver other drugs if they so choose Premier is a cigarette it's marketed by RJ Reynolds for smoking taste and pleasure and the same way that the all other cigarettes made by the company are marketed for smoking taste and pleasure it's not a drug it's not a drug delivery device it's to be smoked for enjoyment by smokers judged by that standard alone Premier so far has been a resounding flop since October RJR has test marketed it in St Louis Phoenix and Tucson, despite heavy promotion sales have been very slow first it's strange it doesn't burn down there's no Ash it's hard to tell when it's out and it smells funny this is the only cigarette that comes with instructions on how to light it then there's the cost up to 30% more than regular cigarettes and as for the taste well this but has become the butt of jokes Jessica's molted it was horrible what did it taste like can you describe it like this open plant in Illinois, still Health officials are very worried that smokers who might otherwise quit will instead turn to Premier thinking it's better for them than conventional cigarettes the package does contain the federally required warning label but the ads call it the cleaner smoke which critics claim is just a left-handed way of saying safer smoke r.j. Reynolds has engaged in what I think is perhaps the most massive deceptive advertising campaign in the history of this country I think that statement is the most massive deception that that I'm aware of, of is it safer there's no claim that it's safer our advertising doesn't say that it's safer is it is what is it safer a safer cigarette you talking about your is no claim that it's safer and I I personally am not competent to evaluate the question RJR claims Premier does not produce the tars linked to lung cancer but critics say it does produce nicotine which is linked to high blood pressure heart attacks and strokes and health experts say it's sophisticated design actually gives the smoker a more direct nicotine hit, initially when you're like that the blast of nicotine you get is far in excess what you get for regular cigarette even the worst of the regular cigarettes so it is an effective nicotine delivery system a substance very addicted to young and old alike which is a major reason that I suspect the company wishes to produce it opponents including top federal health officials have banned together and asked the Food and Drug Administration to regulate perhaps even ban Premier I petitioned the FDA to, elated because I think it is a drug delivery system and you might like to know that my colleagues who work in drug addiction have found that that cigarette is a better drug delivery system in the laboratory than anything they have yet devised nicotine isn't the only drug at issue here scientists at the National Institute on drug abuse say that they tested one of these they found that in just one minute they were able to open it up and load it with crack cocaine writing in the current Journal of the American Medical Association the scientists say they have, machine smoke the altered Premier and found it to be a highly efficient way of smoking crack without anyone being the wiser we've seen test for that and the delivery efficiency is going to be so low that it will be wasteful for the crack abuser and he's not going to want to waste his way to his crack that way but what if that assumption is wrong people get cut with knives people get into accidents with automobiles guns kill people there A lot of products that can be, be put to Illegal uses or abused and lead to harm that's not necessarily the manufacturers fault what has to really ask the tobacco industry at this point where is your code of ethics where are your morals what are you doing to help us convince those 100,000 kids aged 12 and under each year in this country that utilizing your product is a major serious health hazard good Heavens have you no shame cigarettes have, in regulated by a federal health agency but the pressure is mounting on the FDA to regulate this one that could cripple premiers chances of success and be a devastating Financial blow to r.j. Reynolds and with domestic cigarette sales slumping already the entire tobacco industry may get burned by The Fallout from the smokeless cigarette Judd Rose for Nightline in Washington in a moment we'll hear both sides of the debate over this new cigarette as we talked with dr. John Slade one of the, leading critics of the Premier cigarette and Richard campy an official of the RJ Reynolds company this Avatar New York Studios is dr. John Slade one of the country's leading Specialists on smoking and addictive diseases last summer dr. Slade testified before Congress about the dangers of the RJ Reynolds Premier cigarette also with us in our Washington Bureau is the president of RJ Reynolds tobacco development company Richard can't be who oversaw the introduction of the Premier cigarette mr. campy why don't, begin with the question that your attorney felt himself in competent to answer is it a safer cigarette said we're not claiming that this is a safe or safer cigarette we recognize that there are a lot of issues and a lot of criticisms that have been made about cigarettes we certainly recognize that a controversy exists Premier was developed and introduced in response to that controversy a good deal of the controversy focuses around the byproducts of burning tobacco and all of the chemicals that are related or less, aged to be related to the smoking and health controversy Premier substantially reduces many of these controversial compounds and when you compare them to other low tar cigarettes you talking about reductions of 90 to 99 percent now mr. get a let's let's take these things one at a time nice and simply so that even I can understand it we're talking you were talking about a controversy which deals with a lot of chemicals that cause if One Believes the doctors and the American Medical Association in the Surgeon General, Seymour cancer and all those other nasty things like heart disease that we are familiar with if you are claiming that this cigarette has fewer of those nasty chemicals in it than the other cigarettes do then presumably it would be safe to infer that what you've developed is a safer cigarette what I don't understand is if that were the case why can't you say it while Ted the the issues with respect to Tobacco burning cigarettes results in a controversy there's a great deal of statistical Association, based upon epidemiological studies but in terms of hard conclusive proof in terms of laboratory inhalation studies with animals there still are questions all right so you would have no trouble then with my saying that Premier is not a safer cigarette so you've introduced it for some other reason we introduced it to respond to the controversy that's correct we're which part of the controversy are you talking about I'm talking about the things that have been cited the allegations that have been made people find things in tobacco smoke they, the only gatien's Mystic a if you'll forgive me the allegations have to do with this being an unsafe thing to engage in I'm talking about smoking tobacco cigarettes so if this is in response to those allegations why respond if your response doesn't produce a cigarette that safer but it does indeed Ted respond to so many of the issues we're not saying that this is a perfect product no I mean you got it does respond I'm not asking I'm not asking you whether it's a perfect product I'm not asking you whether this is as good as vitamin A or vitamin C for you I'm simply asking whether, of to Tobacco cigarettes this is safer and you don't seem to be able to handle their question why well I think I'd like to go back to what I know what you'd like to go back to what I'm asking you is why you can't handle the question well if you I think I did answer it earlier if you look at the the information that has been made available on Tobacco burning cigarettes we conclude that there is still a controversy that there are still issues that are unresolved but if you look at the issues that people have said indict cigarettes, many of those issues relate to these controversial compounds one of the one of the controversies is the one of the controversial compounds is nicotine right that's correct this cigarette doesn't reduce nicotine intake if one listens to what the doctors say apparently it more efficiently allows you to ingest nicotine that is absolutely untrue nicotine is absorbed it's metabolized it's eliminated and it's distributed in the body based on good sound scientific studies know differently, the nicotine found in tobacco burning cigarettes so this is the same as a tobacco burning cigarette insofar as nicotine is concerned once the nicotine level is less than 97% of all cigarettes sold in America I think it's about time that I went over to dr. slay the darkness lead insofar as the ingestion of nicotine is concerned do you accept what mr. Camp he just had to say with regard to its ingested by the body in the same fashion and therefore I guess you sing is no better or no worse well in part it's certainly used by the body in the same way once it's absorbed but, device this nicotine delivery system delivers the nicotine more efficiently and with much less irritation than a traditional cigarette does so it's potentially more addicting for a novice to start with because it's easier to inhale and easier to start with what do you mean by potentially more addictive well is it more addictive or is it that you don't know yet we don't know yet because Reynolds has had the product itself which is not an available to researchers and all we have are Reynolds animal, studies to draw inferences from and a couple of small human studies and what are they sure they show that this device is far less irritating than regular cigarettes for laboratory animals laboratory animals free this like they breathe room air and they really shut down their breathing when exposed to tobacco smoke well is not good well they know they find this very easy to inhale which means the nicotine gets into their bloodstream quite easily even without any practice with smoking then then dr. Slade why is the the nicotine, all that's in the blood plasma less than cigarettes that burnt tobacco the only system in which that's been tested is with the cigarette that has three times the delivery of the Premier the mr. campy mentioned a minute ago that this cigarette has a this device has a delivery of nicotine that's less than 97% of those in the market but it's in the middle ground of cigarettes if you compare it to traditional cigarettes that can be adjusted by the smoker, to deliver an addicting dose of nicotine the people can compensate to a huge degree what I mean by puffing harder I puffing Harder by taking longer Puffs by puffing more frequently and so there's a there's not any scientific reason so far to feel that this is any different than most cigarettes on the market as far as they could change deliveries concerned clear on this can't be we have to take a break I'll give you a chance to respond to that and then we will also take up this issue of whether this is a useful delivery system for the smoking of crack, a canned and how and why that whole controversy has arisen we'll continue our conversation in a moment, I'm mr. Richard campea the president of r.j. Reynolds development we were talking a moment ago about nicotine nicotine is an addictive drug as I don't know I don't accept the fact that nicotine is an addictive drug I didn't realize that that was an ambiguous question I thought that was a medical fact well if you take a look at the fact that 40 million Americans have chosen not to smoke 95% of those in their own free will without any assistance whatsoever it's awfully difficult to indict something like that is, being addictive we're going to a camp people have quit opium they've quit heroin there's no question that those are addictive drugs simply because someone has the strength of character to quit doesn't mean that what they quit wasn't addictive to begin with well I'm you know Ted you got to come back and take a look at the issue all cigarettes contain nicotine nicotine is a natural part of tobacco it's a natural flavoring ingredient Premier is a cigarette it contains tobacco and it also contains nicotine but at the issue is nicotine and the drug delivery device I think that that's outrageous, this is a cigarette by any definition if you asked a hundred consumers out there to look at this thing light it up I think that they would say it's a cigarette it's lit its inhaled it's exhaled it operates exactly like other cigarette except it doesn't have an ash it has about what I mean you would know precisely one-fifth one-sixth 1/10 the tobacco enter the regular cigarette it has about a third the tobacco of a regular cigarette but now it has approximately half the tobacco when you look at it on a cigarette by cigarette basis but the issue is whether or not this, this is a cigarette which responds to so many of the issues dr. Slade has been criticizing this industry and many anti-smoking zealots for the last 25 years they've said reduce the yields reduce the controversial compounds deal with environmental tobacco smoke here we develop a product that substantially reduces the controversial compounds virtually eliminates environmental tobacco smoke and now these people are saying Jesus product is wrong let's ban it it's not perfect it doesn't go all the way but God is a significant technological, breakthrough it's something that should be looked at reasonably an objectively let's let's talk for a moment well go ahead if you're dr. Slade if you want to respond to that but I do want to leave enough time so we're going to talk about this this allegation of it being usable as a crack smoking device go ahead yes as far as this being there's no question that this is an addictive drug and it's highly addictive and at least as much as cocaine and heroin are and can't mr. camping makes a point about reducing controversial compounds and answering criticisms, he didn't come and consult with health officials about whether we thought in 1989 this would be a good idea in the 1950s and the 1960s filter cigarettes and low tar cigarettes were introduced by the companies companies to allay fears and and keep people smoking to make it look safe to smoke and this is in the great tradition of low tar cigarettes and filter cigarettes dr. Slade why did the Surgeon General and his report asked that by the year 1990 that, cigarette manufacturers reduce the yields of their cigarettes this product goes beyond even that which is contemplated by him the reported by the year 2000 will there still be 40 million smokers has given by government figures by the center of Disease Control I mean there are 50 million Americans what do you want to say 3,000 trees to look like it's not written by the voter natives Alternatives which respond to the issue in the controversy just abandon them well what will hold on a sec what do you mean just abandon them you make it sound as though you keeping blood plasma way from people abandoned people, people so that they can smoke cigarettes is I'm sanding them in terms of providing alternatives to because they're hopelessly addicted to nicotine know if there are 50 million Americans who choose to smoke and if the government even by its own calculations when we're supposed to have a smoke free Society by the year 2000 says that they'll be some 40 million Americans that smoke isn't it not in all of our best interest to develop products technologically that deal with some of these issues it certainly some of the compounds it certainly is no rentals best interest but I think that, we can develop public health systems that help it eat make it easier for people to stop smoking gentleman we've got to take a break and I promise when we come back we will focus the last couple of minutes on the business of cracked delivery will continue in a moment, dr. Slade I'm prepared to be as cynical as the next fellow about the motives of the tobacco industry but surely not you not anyone is suggesting that they have deliberately developed a cigarette the the inside a little metal core of which can be used for the smoking of crack that's been a concern of a lot of my colleagues in the addictions treatment field ever since we saw the preliminary drawings of this last spring that they deliberately did it know that it's possible to do, I don't think at all that this is their intent on how I mean they'll surely can't be held to account for that anymore as someone from RJ Reynolds suggested in the earlier piece anymore than someone who you know makes a knife can be held responsible for someone using it for illicit purposes not talking about responsibility is talking about the potential problem a potential difficulty with what do you think they're going to do about it, I think that the FDA ought to regulate this product as a drug and that this is one of the elements that ought to be considered in sorting out what the potential problems are with this device mr. camping Ted I know and response to dr. Slade I think the whole issue is is ridiculous I think it is being used for the political lens to try to get this product band if you looked at the tests that we're done and the article that was submitted in support of this this assertion an individual would have, smoke a continuous puff for between five and seven minutes and even then they wouldn't get any efficient yield I know very few people who can take a puff and hold a continuously for five to seven minutes as the tests done would suggest an are wearing I think is too emotional eyes the issue but let me just say I'm going to ask you the question of the very emotional fashion if I put a little piece of crack inside one of those cigarettes and gave it to her you would without any hesitation take a puff right I would, I'm asking you now you're not intentionally put any crack into a no no but I mean the cigarette what I'm what I'm asking you is if in fact your contention is correct that no one's going to get any kind of high from this unless they unless they can inhale for a solid five minutes you wouldn't have any problem putting a little piece of crack in their lighting it up and taking a puff would you now I can't I'm not an expert on drugs but we have gone to we went to Francis Mullen he's an extra executive director of the FBI and also is involved with the drug enforcement agency as a group administrator I mean told your work he says that the whole idea, is preposterous there are such other easier method it's not Preposterous and not me it's either easier methods and you can take aluminum cans getting far more efficient yield these people are talking experiment that doctor hitting field and his colleague at night I did do a quarter they were trying to answer the question was it possible for this to deliver crack and they found that it was they weren't trying to duplicate human situations but Reynolds for the last six months has been saying it can't be done and now in this simple experiment, using a system that used with marijuana and tobacco to duplicate useful biological effects they have shown that it can be done all right I'll tell you what I don't want to go over on this program tonight we're in danger of doing that right now but mr. campy I don't want to leave it this Ambiguously and I do want to leave you the last word on that point go ahead make whatever closing comment you want to make on the issue of its use as a crack smoking device well when you follow the experiment the dr. slay just referred to you've got to heat the system beyond the point that the product can't even take it, physically degrades when you look at what happens you burning it at temperatures of over 350 degrees don't know what you're holding in that vial well these are cigarettes that have decomposed as a result of putting it through the same experiment the dr. slay just reported about you're asking a machine to smoke a product for 7 minutes and then you saying that that indeed is the way that a human would smoke in order to extract crack it's a total abuse of the product and it's not even a reasonable way in which it would be done I don't know if somebody who could do that they're beginning to be case reports of people using this too, Vice in just that way all right I'll tell you what on that slightly ambiguous know what I'm afraid I'm going to have to thank you both we have gone a few seconds Beyond are normally a lot of time I hope our Affiliates will excuse us for that I want to thank you mr. campy dr.

fyhb0039,"Eclipse primarily heat rather than Burns tobacco it reduces secondhand smoke by nearly 90%, Aunt doesn't leave any lingering odor and produces virtually no messy ashes it reduces staining on Fabrics such as curtains drapes wallcoverings and it's also low in time nicotine with a smooth Rich tobacco taste, eclipse is clearly what many smokers have been calling for first and foremost they want a good-tasting cigarette but they also want a cigarette that reduces secondhand smoke to address many of the hassles that they feel in today's society with a Clips are Jr.'s developed exactly what many smokers have told us that they're looking for, well they're in our research in Chattanooga over the past few weeks the response to Eclipse has been very encouraging thousands of adult smokers in the Chattanooga area have tried eclipse and a lot of them have told us that they're very interested in buying it on a regular basis retailers of also told list that many of their customers are asking for Eclipse so we're moving to a full-scale test Market including retail availability and Chattanooga beginning June 3rd, we've heard thousands of positive comments from smokers and Chattanooga ranging from the lack of ashes and the lack of lingering cigarettes known their clothes and cars to the positive reaction that they get from non-smokers who are around them when they're smoking a Clips smokers have told us that they've waited a long time for a cigarette like this, our expectations for Eclipse are realistic we don't expect a Clips to appeal to every smoker and our research shows that it's not for every smoker but we are offering a significant new cigarette that many smokers have asked for and one that many smokers and those around them should like,The Cliffs looks like any other cigarette with one exception that's have to lay it in Eclipse has a small high Purity carbon tip that burns and sends warm air through the tobacco role inside the cigarette since the smoke from eclipse is mostly water and glycerin the smoke that is Exhale by the smoker dissipates very quickly and because only the very, tip of the cigarette Burns Eclipse doesn't burn down the way other cigarettes do and there's virtually no smoke off the lid end of the cigarette after the first few Puffs this results in an 85 to 89 percent reduction in second hand smoke compared to the leading cigarette brands, Eclipse primarily Heats tobacco instead of burning it that's the basis for its many benefits it it's made much like any other cigarette with a special difference a tip made from high Purity carbon this tip is wrapped in an insulating heat barrier that keeps the tobacco roll from burning down the rest of eclipse is just like other cigarettes a blend of flying tobacco followed by a regular cigarette filter, as you smoke your eclipse the heat barrier keeps the tobacco roll from burning down inside the cigarette instead when you draw warm air passes over the tobacco getting a just hot enough to create a full-bodied smoke that carries the flavor of the tobacco with it, smoke particles from other cigarettes are about twenty percent water and glycerin but Eclipse Smoke is the reverse about 80% water and Glycerine glycerine is something found in all cigarette smoke as well as many food products and baked goods based on Government testing methods full flavor cigarette Styles range between 15 and 20 milligrams of tar Lifestyles between 6 and 14 and ultralights between 1 and 5 mg but Eclipse which primarily Heats rather than, his tobacco is three milligrams in its full flavor style and to in its mild style for nicotine full flavor cigarettes typically range between point eight and one point seven milligrams of nicotine lights range between .6 and .9 and ultralights range between point 1 and point five but eclipses nicotine level is just point to mg in its full flavor and point one and it's mild Style, and like I said today we are here to talk about exciting you cigarette after marking miles back company called Eclipse now imagine a cigarette that produces almost, most 90% less secondhand smoke the lashes the lingering over practically no state now imagine a cigarette the produces almost 90% less secondhand smoke the lashes no lingering over practically no stain and it is an ultra low power in the cigarette eclipses a cigarette and like your cigarette it's got a filter it's got a roll of tobacco, rapping cigarette paper the difference between eclipse and all the sacraments is the eclipse has a high Purity carbon tip and a farrier okay it has all our Eclipse primarily heats the tobacco rather than burning it we Smokin Eclipse their travels through the tab across the tobacco getting just hot enough to release the flavor and create the smoke, all right, in a way I'll have to say I was skeptical because I thought not no you can't do that how you going to get it the back of flavor if the back tobacco itself doesn't burn, but the answer is in eclipse and they figured it out and I think it's a wonderful concept, well it meant I could smoke in the car because I generally can't smoke in the car because some people are offended by that if they get into my car smells like cigarettes they might not be real happy with me as an, agent and you have to be careful of something like that with the eclipse it really didn't matter they didn't know I was smoking in my car so there was no you know there's no odor so that means a lot to me,well when I first my first concept of it I thought that it's going to be you know basically not real flavorful cigarette I was really surprised, well I've never been one for causes I've never been involved in any demonstrations but the week I had the eclipse cigarettes I was sharing them with my smoking friends I was smoking around my non-smoking friends I was getting feedback from everyone that was around me and so I shared my cigarettes and I told everyone this is absolutely the greatest thing I mean I really believe in the cigarette, and I will buy them, I just noticed that the the owner is not in my house anymore because I used to smoke the regular cigarettes and I would come back in you know like say you would go out to the store or something like that in the house is are closed in any kind of that kind of like a musty odor you know and now with the eclipse and you walk into your house you don't have that musty odor anymore,Eclipse primarily hates tobacco instead of burning it that's the basis for its many benefits it it's made much like any other cigarette with a special difference a tip made from high Purity carbon this tip is wrapped in an insulating heat barrier that keeps the tobacco roll from burning down the rest of eclipse is just like other cigarettes a blend of fine tobacco followed by a regular cigarette filter, ER as you smoke your eclipse the heat barrier keeps the tobacco roll from burning down inside the cigarette instead when you draw warm air passes over the tobacco getting a just hot enough to create a full-bodied smoke it carries the flavor of the tobacco with it, smoke particles from other cigarettes are about twenty percent water and

fypj0015,"imagine a cigarette with smoke that disappears like this and smells like this imagine a cigarette that leaves no ashes, I'll leave your windows this clear introducing eclipsed by Vantage the cigarette that reduces secondhand smoke by 95% hi I'm Mark Elliott and I'm Carol maze we're part of the team introducing Eclipse around the country we'd like to take a few minutes to tell you about it it sounds impossible doesn't it cigarettes, smoke that's satisfying and full-bodied but leaves no odor no stains and practically no secondhand smoke I have to say I was a little skeptical at first look at the smoke when Carol exhales and see how fast it disappears next time you smoke your cigarettes see how long it takes for its smoke to disappear and look at this there is virtually no smoke off the lid end I mean you really have to try it to believe it so how does it work girl it's a pretty simple idea Eclipse primarily Heats, go instead of burning it inside it doesn't look very different but the way it works makes a big difference in the Smoke eclipse is made much like any other cigarette but it's got something special a tip made from high Purity carbon this tip is wrapped in an insulating heat barrier that keeps your eclipse from burning down so the tobacco doesn't burn the rest of the cigarette is a blend of fine tobacco's followed by a regular cigarette filter, when you light up your lighting the carbon tip so take an extra puff and a longer draw use a good flame a car lighter won't work very well once it's lit the carbon tip gets hot and stays hot until your eclipse is done as you smoke your eclipse the heat barrier keeps the tobacco from burning down inside the cigarette instead warm air passes over the tobacco getting it just hot enough to create a full-bodied smoke that carries the flavor of the tobacco with it, since it doesn't burn down Eclipse doesn't have any smoke coming off the lid end there's nothing added to the tobacco that isn't another cigarettes but the smoke is different right Mark right what Eclipse does is take common tobacco smoke and well turn it upside down smoke particles from other cigarettes are about twenty percent water and glycerin but Eclipse Smoke is the reverse about 85% water and Glycerine glycerine is something, found in all cigarette smoke as well as many food products such as cookies for example, now let's get down to brass tacks Mark what are the tar and nicotine numbers exactly well Carol let's take a look most full flavor Styles have between 14 and 20 milligrams of tar light Styles have between 7 and 13 milligrams of tar and ultra light cigarettes typically have between one and six milligrams in comparison Eclipse which Heats rather than Burns tobacco has about three milligrams of tar in its full flavor style and to and it's mild Style, as you know Carol all these tar levels come from methods the measure tar from cigarettes that burnt tobacco since Eclipse primarily Heats rather than Birds tobacco it's sort of like comparing apples to oranges that's right in fact with those methods the glycerin and eclipse is recorded as tar if they didn't include glycerin Eclipse would have at our level even less than 1 milligram, now looking at nicotine levels full flavor styles of other cigarettes typically contain between point eight and one point seven milligrams of nicotine lights range between .6 and .9 and ultralights range between point 1 and point five in comparison Eclipse has 0.1 milligrams of nicotine, and because Eclipse Smoke is mostly water and glycerin it has a smoother taste and disappears very fast kind of like your breath on a cold Winter's morning exactly this smoke combined with the fact that there's no smoke off the lid end is what gives Eclipse a 95 percent reduction in secondhand smoke right you know the way Eclipse works is something like making coffee, when you pour the hot water all the flavors release from the grounds the grounds are still there when you're finished but the flavor is gone so you throw them away, just as you do you're finished eclipse, you really notice the difference when we're both smoking the smoke doesn't build up in the room and you can be confident that smoke stains won't build up on your walls your windows your curtains even your teeth it takes a while to notice that Eclipse doesn't stain or build up but here's a way that you can see the difference right now, Mark's going to Exhale smoke from a leading light cigarette through some curtain fabric, notice the result, now he'll do the same with a clips, take a look at the difference, here's another thing about eclipses that's pretty amazing would you pass me the other a story Carol, because Eclipse doesn't burn down it doesn't leave any ashes if you put it down the tip keeps burning slowly but look at this if the cigarette somehow falls out of the ashtray it can lie flat on the table without burning it in fact eclipse is much less likely to start a fire than other cigarettes but be careful if the tip is still hot the tip Burns as long as any other cigarette about six to seven minutes so you get about the same number of Puffs as your regular brand just before eclipse, goes out you'll start getting less smoke The Taste gets weaker that's how you can tell your eclipse is finished now we've just enjoyed our cigarettes and all I can smell is the coffee it's great and everyone who comes in this room really know this is the difference but we've been talking long enough right well there's still a lot more about the eclipse begins let's hear from people all over America who had a chance to try a clips for a while and see its benefits, I thought the eclipse would either taste like absolutely nothing or it tastes really bad because it didn't burn like a normal cigarette Burns but I laughter I had an eclipse or two or three it wasn't you know I was kind of surprised it actually tastes more like a cigarette than I expected it to being a Salesman and I'm you know on the road in my car all day long smoking Eclipse you know cut down the stain on my windows and the smell of my clothes and in my hair and and being out dealing with the public, that's something nowadays that you have to worry about my friend that I walk with, I read their a drive to church or she dressed the church in when I smoke in her car she says I can't tell your smoking I can't smell it for me personally the key benefit of Clips is the lack of mess that's associated with cigarettes there's not the Ashes to clean up or we'll be all over the house and the windows in the house in the car don't have that Hayes on them and you don't have to clean up as much and I like that, occasionally go up to the bedroom or something to change I'll have a cigarette with me and next thing you know all your clothes smell like cigarette smoke with the eclipse you can't tell that you were even in the bedroom what's the eclipse it was great I could still do dishes and stuff and I didn't have this Burning cigarette burning up into my face and Ashes dropping in my food or on my laundry while I'm folding it I didn't have any qualms about smoking in the eclipse inside the house because, was there was no visible you know smoke anywhere and there was no smell it was it was a clean kind of cigarette I can't see any any reason why any smoker wouldn't switch to an eclipse I think if everyone smoked Eclipse smokers and non-smokers would probably get along a lot better than they ever have thanks for joining us and taking the time to learn about

fzgb0039,"okay, as you know we're going to wait on Janice is going to join us midstream, what I'm going to do is talk to you for about 45 minutes about your experience in the last three weeks you've participated in a study that started about three or four weeks ago study just concluded last week I think it was you've either been back here I've talked to somebody on the phone several times in the last few weeks and we're very interested now in this portion of the test is known as qualitative which is to try to get your attitude and opinions we know what you put down on the written questionnaire now we want to find out what's going on in your head about the product, what I want to start with though is if you could just for the record give us your name let us are you married do you have children that are in the house do you have grandchildren that are in the house do you live with a smoking spouse just a little bit about yourself Hobbies things like that okay I am married have two children a daughter 21 a son 15 they're both at home let me see my husband does smoke my children do not let me see I just quit, work well I worked at a daycare or six years and of course we weren't allowed to smoke inside daycare but I took breaks went outside you know away from the children right or they can influence the children right now I think I'm just trying to enjoy summer and, okay with my son and what you spoke as you use your breath okay Vantage ultra light Vantage Ultra Lights hmm okay how much do you smoke a day forth in the need to travel a little over a pay a little over yeah okay I'd say it to a pack and a half a day okay okay how about you said that your husband spoke with this he smoked Marlboro Lights Barbara let's Okay and we have he's what do you like to do I like to cross stitch I like to go fishing with, going camping some more and things like that one of the first things do you smoke in your house and used to okay and then we both quit smoking that stayed quiet for three years and it's are for this white sounds but by the time you get the wild wash down that you know what I'm talking about now so we'd sad then we would not smoke inside the house so we smoke outside okay so both you and your husband smoke outside, where do you smoke I had important porch yeah so this is a self-imposed restrictions yes if you find it difficult in doing that or are you pretty much used to that now pretty much used to it but boy when it's cold it's rough we're letting your car keys yes okay so you got it okay, there are smoking restrictions here in Chattanooga have started I don't know how well they enforce it because I'm not one of these people that, just bound and determined they eat other if they say I mean I do respect other people and not smoking other people's houses you know I think that's just a common courtesy I don't know that I agree with the mouth saying that because you're not smoking in the stores it was like damn you know outside but yeah there's just you know several now that's getting restrictions on them and of course I never have like I say I'm not one of these it's going to, sit there and try and force it you know good okay first question I have is it relates to when you came in here a few weeks ago you saw a demonstration of a new cigarette we're going to spend the rest of our time talking about the new cigarette various aspects about it tell me what do you remember about the demonstration what was the what was it like what were they talking about and it was a long time ago but okay well they showed us a family, and I've gotta admit it was hard to believe at the time you know talking about the film and the family would leave like I'm married you know that that's not going to happen now and I'll be truthful we did smoke those cigarettes inside our house people non-smokers that came in could not tell it okay so you have sin was very very pleased very special yeah even in the car because in the car you know crack the window, let's smoke away up we're going to talk about you and the reaction of others in what happened at home but back to that demonstration there was a there was a man and a woman that led the discussion what were the types of things that they were talking about the discussion what do you consider to be what do you remember the most was the most memorable part of that whole discussion okay well I had the chart about the lower tar and nicotine okay which was a big thing and then like I say even talking about you know you, I won't say that you don't have to be careful but not as careful just such as laying it down on the table whatever you know or if you dropped it the one thing I think that I didn't realize as much and they were talking about you know it was an adjustment for the cigarette right which is a big adjustment but yeah just talking about all the differences in it but I think a lot of it, yes and at the lower tar and nicotine in about filtering about how it heats up and it's not burning the tobacco okay so they talked a little bit about why it works the way yeah and I even cut one open okay you know and Shout a scene just look like dried yeah a rather than Barnes looked up to talking about how nice it is not to have the ashes hmm you know which to me non-smokers that's one of the, the big things you know besides the odor and they ashes is writing things okay for you remember to knock a lot what would you consider to be in that hour long discussion what would you consider to be the number one thing that you walked away from that thinking that this is important what do you read what is the the best recollection you have of that whole demonstration, I think the lower tar and nicotine was the big thing but I don't think I really quite, belief this is much then now I'll be truthful because this is fun so they had a time in the discussion for people to ask questions did you ask a question in the now we're sitting down here talking about couldn't believe that it wouldn't lie film only talking about how you didn't believe it you remember some of the questions that were asked, of course they were asking you know had we know that there's not something else in this cigarette that okay you're not telling us okay and I stress the fact that what is in that cigarette is no different than what is in your regular cigarette same factors just different ratios okay okay now I think is what 88 percent water and then 12% glycerin and, yeah the difference in they had and how it would be more like a vapour okay but yeah there was some I think skeptical about they and then of course you know talking about, the difference about not having to be, you know as careful with the regular cigarettes and the okay okay did you like the demonstration was there it was interesting but like I say it's, I think hard to believe you know you walk out thinking sure sure yeah got it what, then you had to try the product at the demonstration yes it has their own cigarettes do you cry what was your reaction to the first cigarette when you try to does it wanton Bay and it wasn't bad yeah it wasn't what I was expecting how is it different, okay, first of all I tried I smell cold fronts okay and I tried an ultra-light in his stupid is what this sounds it tasted stronger than mild mild your life okay okay so thinking and they did ask Dean 11 try men which I tried that one right there on the floor okay right okay to me the full flavor, and the ultralight in the new cigarette with not that much different because they weren't so I ended up smoke and when I did this I ended up smoking the for fly for flavor and do you recall a net is that the tar and nicotine the same or different the full flavor versus the what they were calling the mile, do you recall no okay no I really don't I was thinking it was the same that I maybe know you're actually right on that it is the same and they just taste a little bit different but you're right there they are very similar so it wasn't what you expected would you in you said it was okay with wizard worse than you expected better than you expected better was better okay what were you expecting, I don't think I really know what I was expecting because of all the benefits they were talking about, I don't think I really realized what it was I guess I expected it to taste like some of the basic cigarettes okay which I cannot stand that give me headaches okay and I guess I was expecting something along that line though I really was not expecting but the more you smoked of those the better you like them okay they you know it is an adjustment okay we're going out tonight okay we're good we're going to talk a lot about that, part of the the presentation used a videotape do you recall the videotape what were what were some of the things in the videotape if that all that you remember okay it was the main woman and they were talking about how it was like Steam and they had like the, once a coffee pot thing okay showing the steam that it would and then they would smoke cigarette and love smoked where you could see right you know that it was disappearing it didn't just linger and and I land, I think that's a lot of that that it was talking about and I think they even brought up about you know it didn't leave the film The odor the smokeless okay Ashley good good good memories of everything it was in there all right you had a chance to take the product home hmm what is it to a net what is the biggest benefit that you see of the of the cigarette after smoking it for a couple weeks what is the one thing that you can sit back and say this is to me key in this product, okay, I would say because of the lower tar and nicotine you can feel it because you don't cough is much we mean by the okay with smoking and you know it bring on site has problems or whatever you know I don't think you can talk as much so you notice that after the two weeks of smoking it yes ok when will you notice it, I guess a couple of days after okay you know there was a difference did you make a complete switch to this product during the test or did you dabble with your usual brand a little bit tell me about how you use it, no it was it was basically a complete switch don't get me wrong maybe in that week maybe I have a pack okay of regular okay but now it was basically a complete Suite okay so you made a complete switching you noticed in a couple days that you do you weren't coughing as much as what you thought okay you've been back to your usual brand for how long now since last Thursday last Thursday how do you, but your usual brand after going back to that now, the same as you did before the sign is that did before but if I had it to do it where they kept on asking you know about like what would you buy what would you buy right, okay I think when it came down to it I would buy the new cigarette but probably had by half and half okay half and half way half we have, the only thing I'll K the only thing I have against cigarette is it is an adjustment to smoke them what is the biggest adjustment in your mind well at first when you start lighting you're like you know really or not yeah harder to lie I think that's a big thing but then like I say the more you smoke them the more you do it just out to it and then, if you're outside whether it could be a faulty cigarette or not sometimes it would go out just real soon okay this long without end I really felt like it was the wind okay, then let me see okay harder to light didn't last as long as some of the cigarettes a big fault with it like I think your base bad like if they're on the telephone to smoke okay and if you're talking or something or you know you have company and you wait when you start with that cigarette it's like you have to keep on smoking it but if you have a pause in between then it's like you're having to do that, that purple over again to get it going again to get it going again how big of a problem is that for you, I mean obviously you're fighting it's aggravating what was it still aggravating at the end of the second week to do that, well I think that's where I had come to know that once you lift those up you need to go ahead and finish them and not have the passes okay okay as stupid as that sounds no that we've heard that before that's good I appreciate you sharing that,what did you really like about the product during the two weeks talked about your some of your dislikes what is it that you liked the taste is not bad at all okay not bad at all and I'll be truthful I did enjoy smoking them inside the house you so you cuz I but you smoke in the porch but with these we did smoke me inside okay when you say we you're sharing them I shared some with my husband I think it's like a pack and a half okay and so no I still took, some of those outside you know on the porch to but then if I was inside and doing something one cigarette I didn't stop go outside with those are let him up inside how do you feel about that I enjoyed that part you know really even order in the house so and I honestly felt like it was course don't get me wrong I know that that short of time you couldn't tell but I really did not, feel like it was leaving any film or anything because I'm certain you've been in smokers houses especially if we're to I'm smoking you can tell on the wind has the glasses you know and I honestly did not feel it was leaving any of that family okay so you like that aspect, obviously other than the people who live in the house with you your husband and your two children the over the couple week period of Time how many people do you think you talk to about the cigarette you know first of all how many do you talk to and then I'm going to ask a follow-up question which is how many people did you let try it first of all how many people do you think now because of a net know something about this cigarette, I'd say 15 15 people okay what did you tell them about well they were amazed okay you know we're talking well course you know some of them noticed that it wasn't you know burning down and sort of looked at you funny okay and so anyway you know talking about you know that it was like an experimental thing test stages what did you tell them, well I think the biggest thing that they were amazed as there wasn't burning down you know so we went through this deal about you know just Heats of tobacco it doesn't burn it you know it was supposed to be lower in tar and nicotine it's not supposed to leave them you know there's no ashes no you know went through the whole bit because you know like I say they were amazed right amazing in a good way or skeptical, half and half half in here how does it I'm curious how does it feel to be it sounds like you had to explain the cigarette you were kind of the center of attention well it's like they're going you know it can't be a cigarette if it's not going to burn down okay and what would you tell them to that just talking about it doesn't burn the tobacco you just hate it okay yeah that that's why it took longer to light it to get it you know that the little, tip on the end you know was what was keeping it going in okay yeah okay so about 15 people than you talk to about it the most of that occur in the first couple days there was that spread over the two weeks that you sort of spray it over the two-week spread over the two weeks and the general reaction of course people are amazed by it would you say the general reaction or the feedback that you received was it neutral - positive both okay you know someone was really, graced with it and of course send this smoked you know tried it okay then some that didn't smoke course it's like everything else will you don't really know what's in it okay you okay so they expressed some skepticism over how it was made or we're getting a house how we don't know if it's better for you are not it how would you answer that question well I'll tell him I said well that's true I'm taking their word for it okay, you know but but really and truly I felt better you felt better uh-huh did you tell anybody that yes what was their reaction to that, well steal the same some of the ones that Skeptics I think well I always be Skeptics and the ones that was amazed you know I think would have liked to have had some to try for themselves to see I guess that's a good way for okay what about other smokers how many different people that smoke did you let try the product, oh gosh I forgot hanging it was to take the car home thanks I'm just gonna do this I want you to meet a net and that Janice okay we're going to get out of here in time so I don't want either one of you to worry about that yet put your purse down and make yourself comfortable here for about a half hour okay, and that's had the benefit here of already talking to me for about 15 minutes so I'm going to I'm going to pick on you and then we're going to come back to in remind me if I forget to the reaction of other smokers to the product but before we do that Janice quickly tell us a little bit about yourself married single do you live with a smoker do you have kids in the house okay I married my husband smokes we smoked the same brand of cigarettes you smoke Winston in the Box okay 24 year old daughter, lives with us but she doesn't even matter because right so she has like a it's not an apartment but it's a room bigger than this so we don't smoke in her room okay are anywhere around her she doesn't smoke and I have a married daughter and she doesn't smoke okay she doesn't they don't live with you no okay and her husband doesn't smoke, believes in an apartment close to me but she smokes okay no I think that's good I just wanted to get a flavor for who you lived with did they smoke pot smokers D and this is a question for both of you do you enjoy smoking, nod your head yes you enjoy smoking you feel guilty about smoking or do you just you get okay so you see you enjoy it but you feel guilty right do you wish that you could quit yes you do you do you want do you want to quit, I'd like to do you like to to certain yeah to certain extent I enjoy it but I also realize I probably be healthier not smoking I think that see it okay okay, I was talking to a letter earlier about you've been participating in some research for a few weeks now in this is the end of the research and it's time for us to ask some questions again in side your head and get at how you feel about the experience the first part of the experience I wanted to talk about Janice was you came here a few weeks ago for a demonstration of the product do you remember that yes okay we remember specifically about the demonstration what three weeks later you were you were here for an hour tell me about what you saw, well one of the things that impressed me a lot was watching the film watching the film and seeing that the smoke disappears is like steam uh-huh I was really impressed with low tar and nicotine okay what kind of how low was the turn nicotine do you remember I'm trying to think now it's alright I know it's hard to do I think well I think you could smoke like 30 of those cigarettes 21, Winston and I think it was like nineteen percent turn nicotine That was supposed to 80 something okay how are you remembering a little bit of a chart you remember what the numbers are now I thought it was 88% water 12% okay glace renting something on the new one and I'm probably run okay I don't know maybe you're both the right I'll tell you before you leave here though who's right and who's wrong okay so you remember that in the end, and the video tape and I remember, trying to get the cigarette lid that was in the in the group in the group okay and what happened well it's just hard to get lit in the course I was really excited when I found out we were going to get to take some home okay real excited about that what was your first reaction to the product which was it what you expected, I didn't really know what to expect but it was it was good I meant for a long time one of the girls in the group in commented that about a month ago she started smoking real light cigarettes and that it took her about a month to to get to that point where she you know felt comfortable with the new cigarettes just cut out a lot of them and so, I wasn't disappointed when I found that they were not quite as strong as mine because I sort of expected that okay and I thought well you know I'll get used to it okay that's something I'll just get used to just like that I had to learn to be nailed okay okay take me two years to learn about the old guy would all right what do you consider you after having been with the product for a little bit, of time what do you consider to be the one key benefit of a few well I felt my when I would smoke those sort of set of time about 8:00 at night when I sat down to watch TV or something like that and I would just smoke those cigarettes and then smoke maybe one Winston before I went to bed but I noticed that didn't hurt in the year what do you mean by that, don't know I smoked a lot at night when I'm watching TV just and because I have a lot of nervous energy and that's reason I'm afraid that I wouldn't be successful quitting smoking I don't think I have any trouble going through the pain of it but it's just the what I do with myself for 30 years mmm so, when I smoke so much at night and noticed that my chest will hurt a little bit right in here and those did okay those didn't cause me to they were real hard too, draw for me okay that was that was sort of hard and, so, as a result I didn't smoke as much because, and so that benefit I didn't smoke as many of my Winston's as I did when I didn't have the new cigarettes because, I wouldn't allow myself to smoke the Winston's so I sort of you know time to myself why don't you allow yourself to smoke them because I wanted to just just smoke those cigarettes just exclusively like for a couple hours not not trade back and forth and because if I did, at first when I first got the cigarettes when I would try to trade back and forth I found that I wouldn't smoke those okay and so as a result I didn't didn't really know how how they just you know maybe go half a day or something without smoking those and I just keep on smoking my Winston and my daughters were so impressed with cigarettes and they wanted me to smoke those why because they want me to quit real bad they want my husband myself to quit real bad they were, about us they hate the second-hand smoke we know we can't smoke around them how did they feel about the cigarette oh they didn't mind it at all I we went to we have an antique shop with my oldest daughter and we go on buying trips every two weeks and we my husband and myself my daughter we rather the truck and so, we were allowed to smoke these cigarettes in the truck with your daughter with her okay and I mean that's if you knew how ugly they acted even know that was a real I mean they just act awful mmm what is it about this that she liked well they they did well she thought she was smelling him when we first load them up we discovered it was because we were using matches so when we started using their lighters to line them up then she didn't even she didn't even, we were smoking okay she wouldn't even know we were smoke because the big truck right and so she didn't mind those who don't and in the motel room you know we usually you know stay together because we were you know 26 hours from home and so we're never allowed to smoke in the room and she she didn't mind a smoker okay is that important to you her reactions to will cigarettes and a lot of time with her since I have, business with her my youngest daughter now she's not at home much and I don't go many places with her",0.8409691861445782,0.60710776,0.91283935,fzgb0039,,tobacco;

fzgv0183,"sit down, okay here's where we're at is what we're doing my name is Keith and I'm going to be your discussion leader tonight by way of background I have an independent opinion research company and I'm based out of Washington DC and what we're doing is conducting a study that's part of a much larger study where we're doing a number, a of these kind of discussion groups and it's about people's reaction to the way media treats corporations and we're going to focus very very narrowly tonight on one specific example of that it's it's one article in a newspaper magazine and you'll see the top there's as businessweek free questionnaire it's an art article that you're going to be reading a we're going to be talking about it's about one company it'll become it's pretty clear in the questionnaire which company is about, and it's that's it's basically just it's just a research project what we're going to do when it comes time to talk I'll call and some people with generally it's a chance just to have a free-flowing discussion there's no right answer is no wrong answer the only thing I probably will ask you is just to go one at a time and the reason that is is because we're we make a recording of This which helps me write a report for my clients and one at a time helps get it on the tape so if you'll start by filling out these questionnaires I'd, she ate it and at the very top on the right hand thing there's a right hand side there's an ID code you can put the number that's on your on your little name tent there up top that would help me a lot, and there's also questions on the back so don't forget to fill out the back as well all right number two, put three slots but we only have 10 people so one numbers fishing I'll be right back going to get a cup of coffee,jobs are also, you figured out it's okay to get up and get absolutely no problem,okay well a couple your finishing off by filling out the backside there one of the one of the major companies are asking about it here is Philip Morris we're going to focus a lot on that company tonight what what are your basic because you've come into this room what our basic opinions of them any words or phrases used to describe a large diverse diverse, connecting with tobacco, what else, - I just hope the move to the side or something how many people saw this movie The Insider, correct describe what was it, based on a 20 - 40 bucks Philip Morris but as far as I know it's somebody else, just about a interview that was quashed on 60 Minutes, what's going on Mike Wallace is in the movie portrayed by Christopher Plummer and just gave it just has a very negative image of the tobacco industry, a man who worked at that he could work with them but sort of is going to be kept secret, it's running be sold by suggest you do have two hot girls and I know that their product line most of it I use besides your cigarettes so I think for people come because all the product line is operated company's products which ones how many foods, I don't put I don't know, top of which evening persons of Philip Morris is a company old company blue-chip steady growth well-diversified Lena, it's sort of a negative impact on me, how do you know a bunch of other corporations that were right at their companies like AOL General Electric Walt Disney Texaco how do you how do you think of Philip Morris against those kind of companies or comparison to those kind of companies, about the same or different go go ahead down, all right well I would say for the most part that full of more probably has this negative image because of all of the controversy with the smoking whereas most of the other companies many of them of course are very Diversified but most people just recognize them you know when they're freaks ban you and for the most part, I would think that they have a positive image field in terms of contributing something positive for you look I mean I'm sure Fillmore's like you to write up this way I'm sure they do a lot of charitable things I'm sure they do like community service you know as mentioned here 30 with their employees which were like you said it's old or plugs old company and good stock whatever you know if I go to sleep, Lion King or go to Disney World I get really excited about Disney but there was a whole report came out of book the maps that something about Disney that was quashed when their theme park their new theme park opened up with the animals ever get what's called animals were dying before hand you know Texaco at this whole discrimination suit against them not creating a African-Americans fairly you know I don't know if I would necessarily not fill up my car with Texaco but, you know your you watch these things and tobacco especially as you know has a negative mindset but you know I might boycotting ABC or ESPN because of the things that Disney does know but there's certain things that always company have and I look out for them I see what's in the paper and I'm aware of some of them talk about two different versions of Philip Morris the rest is from the welder they own craft food so there they do, the first and foremost the tobacco company and that was like their engine and the Kraft Foods part of his doing real good but their stock is done broke poorly recently because of the lawsuit, but I'm free anti-smoking so you know wouldn't, I'm not sure what they're getting at in the way the economy is the company's earnings are incredible a lot of these so people will sacrifice that well I'm a Believer and smoking but the earnings were unbelievable and so then the the lawsuits come and the biggest thing was the blatant lying in front of Congress we didn't know that nicotine was harmful and that's kind of, go ahead like I think your favorite change your name to Graham Foods their stock would be 100% harder today their dividend has eight percent which is high and I think the stock would be one of the best docs on the market and as a result of bad this city through papers and articles and Newsweek or whatever everybody who's the owner of this talk and some people rely on them for their livelihood has suffered the negative part of Omar's I agree with these cigarette proton blast, but the positive part of the 99% of your other company which is also a very profitable is not realized by mostly public there's a kind of a stark choice in the back number for about people who are top corporate Executives of Philip Morris very Stark choice and what they're asking you to do is choose one that they're seeing their like senior Executives any other company got a legitimate job to do or there are moral because, they sell a product that harms that users would which side did you all come down to how many how many took the first one gentleman job will go with the last one there more might take that, whether it's just I mean like you said pack is bad but they're going to promote it because it's getting in my head is getting them some money there's just negative and positive with anything and I think anybody I think Miller because many people have tobacco industry and they don't do it to the alcohol people they'll go after many many other companies, these Pages tobacco companies versus Choice whether he wants to be killed by performing these products or not well it's Fabio killing logic, health insurance companies in America are redevelop billion dollars into cigarette companies a few years ago so like anything else in a capitalist Society mutated to go with the bed you are good things that Philip Morris manufacturers also all right is Phillip Morris changing I mean not obvious there's a lot going on in the legal world and public opinion and politics around, and the products it goes cigarettes at Philip Morris makes are they changing at all or not, as a company trying to change your image apparently yeah because they're trying to acquire all the kids that are 18 like they like to drink in like they Park them at their under 21 now it's like we can't get them was you show idea if people come here which is which doesn't really know how much are they doing that I know personally I work on a college campus and the number of young people smoking now compared to 45 years ago as a lot, big companies are tiny little little stores they don't care they're going to feel like I could bring more money into them they're going to cry that's losing profit for that felt it only makes me think they're changing yeah I think the whole tobacco industry is kind of change the way they operate in Pastor has a lot of secret documents and, Court proceedings in the lawsuit Center think on Earth some of the unethical practices tobacco industry not just Philip Morris but the other major tobacco companies like Reynolds and, I think they think as any industry or any person does as you as you as you live and grow and learn from your mistakes I think it's very important to them to have I think it's important to any company to have a good image Public Image so are they doing to improve their I think so they're in a couple industries that are controversial like they own Miller and there's a lot of times with drinking and some tobacco lines of Marlborough and, there's a lot of problems with, that so there is some controversial Industries and, overall they have a really good job of marketing the products you know keeping ourselves down, their marketing actually offends me though because I as an ex-smoker it's very good morning is extremely well targeted marketing if you look at the way they're going after the 18 to 22 year old market and it offends me because as an expo I know, well what it can do to your body and I'm just afraid that it's so good as this gentleman mentioned that is increasing smoking is increasing yeah because you know what there's smoke in here because they can get the gear all the the jackets in the t-shirts and the luggage so you smoke more just to get the stuff off twice as fast yeah that's what they're doing that's what the cuts by their War aim towards the kids because it's, the new smoking go Outdoors giving bring moves away and anybody else what else besides making it ugly too there are some signs do you think that they've got wallet some of the promotional period oh I think there has definitely been, n/a overall decrease in the amount of advertising I remember and I don't know where the camel is the Philip Morris cigarette or not but it was a lot of controversy over the the camel young people getting you know using that and your promotions but I think that overall the whole smoking controversy and with young people I think they smoke the question peer pressure when I used to smoke I Smith be cool with it was the, in thing to do not because of any ads or I just think it's a peer thing that sometimes we tend to put the responsibility for something that perhaps parents should be you know dealing with with your children when the the public none of my children ever took up to have to look and even though I used to smoke I think it's just a gum, the type of social issue that people need to deal with within their own groups as opposed to blaming the corporation for the speaker person right there I think it's a backlash what's a backless I think I think there's more young people smoking because it's so because of the pressure not to Smith from The Establishment to do something so it's a rebellion through its at the more the, how much more I mean you brought drive down and pull boards and you see all this non-smoking spot that wasn't there five years ago which more young people smoking I'm just going from what I say, I work address on pan, I just see a lot more young people spoke very few years ago does anyone know if that's true that there are any status I haven't read anything I don't know my impression was it was leveling it's leveled off though we're down slightly but I don't know maybe maybe those schools it is up okay well one of the things we're going to do tonight is quite a bit of homework so I hope you brought your homework shoes with you first thing we're going to do I'm going to pass out this article I told you we were going to look at look at this article, I want you to pass it out but just put it in front of you don't open it up yet I want you to look at the cover look at the cover and then after you take those take take one of these and pass it along to if we end up short down at the end up and basically on the gray sheet on the gray sheet everything on the gray sheet or some questions about the cover I'd like you to take your pencil answer those three questions that are there, the three questions say what's the main point that's being communicated by discover what do you think the main focus of this article is going to be and what impact does the cover have on your own perceptions of Philip Morris if any, okay three questions just write a short answer to each, a couple words or sentence just based on the cover,once you finish writing the answer to this then I like you to spend the time to read through the article, and now I will say this again but I realize it's going to take awhile when I read it at my usual fifth grade Pace it took me about 25 minutes so maybe maybe about 20 minutes to Pace yourselves 15-20 minutes to go through it and read it for me then we're going to talk about it after you read,I'm back, sorry,finish I got two more sheets for you to fill out, the end of a writing session from then,yeah put your number on the yellow sheet all the shoes,you can smoke there, she's a she's like a militant Pro Smoker she loves boats letter to the owner of the house members are similar but he lived Hugh's dish lives in Cincinnati correct I know I didn't do that to a friend of mine, the children he fathered they didn't mention and little fairy have the think they're animals the some kind of all kind of stuff I read so the movie as crazy as it seems that happened didn't it didn't scratch the surface areas for agencies, we'll just have a little discussion just,okay we can start talking here about Rusty I haven't finished up your Yellow Pages of paper we go ahead and just finish up we'll talk amongst the rest of us what tell me some of your major impressions of what you read some of the top impressions, I was disappointed to see that they really have no intention of getting out of tobacco if anything your whole problem is to explain the World Market to maintain that ten billion dollars a year in Revenue to get each year 66 percent of the company's net income I was hoping to see that they were trying to shrink tobacco market and get into other areas but, seem to not be the case, Karen how much you I don't smoke either but I just I didn't see why they should get out of the backyard like it's not like I don't I agree with them like I didn't see them at fault for what people choose to do I mean they're just making it that they don't go with another company is going to do it or another, I was thinking the other day I decided to be a great stock price I really feel like anything else this is a real bad boy today tomorrow someone else it'll be a bad boy never forget about Philip Morris for a while and it's talk is so undervalued it's mind boggling my opinion, they want to share that opinion this would be a good stock to buy now after with did you have that opinion could be created by this article yes this is the names there I know it's Tom and also come you can just leave them at that's right that's just saw something on TV about 12 more singles on CNBC when I know, Philip Morris and everything the time it was probably goodbye there was one interesting thing that I said I can worst case scenario they completely lost all the lawsuits there really for problem rs.100 a case all I have to do is raise the price of a pack of cigarettes 7 class sensitive breaking I thought that was pretty cool the people that smoke was still there, for $20 a share and making trillions so it's a most strange why, John what kind of Impressions did you have out of this article I researched many because I only before this article I own a stock I followed I believe that undervalued but I'll also with him lost half the half of their market value and that we think it's you know rebound quickly regardless there's other stocks out there right now that you can buy off you want to make a profit much quicker profit on, long term with your good stuff too hello other takeaways from the article over the stock side what how do you think they come across I was how does the company come across this particle, companies trying to Rebound with the public as far as for opinion or the opinion trying to fight too bad public opinion with their own quick public in their charity work in their contributions are far better than most other companies, I was kind of surprised that God wants us there or not but if they're going to try to paint a pretty picture of themselves there wasn't anything in the article about what it's like working for the company for Joe everyday employee it was all about the big guy there was no motion all the operating operating in I thought I caught were starting your autopilot for the figured it's going to be not the person that works here the regular guy says it's a great place to work well I guess it, outside of the smoke you know I think you're right now spending more that too but the one thing it does touch on that I think is a key to some degree of the article is what the employees told the company is that weird Bounty image and we won't change and based on that they started all these things you know to change the image it's kind of like you know what we'll use to pull doublethink in 1984 you know it's bad when you have free choice in it which is an argument I have or and I don't think is responsible, you know they do these things with the youth you know to prevent smoking but on the other hand you know they go into college campuses where kids are so anxious young people want kids to get a job you know and you start 40,000 and I'm going into the third world where there's not as much militancy against smoking and was more accepted I'm not a big fan of the Palestinians like one found that it was a defensive what we're doing with them and mention and the other thing I got the impression is you know they're really dealing with the best in the, brightest the lawyer they mentioned there you know work I think the County Administration it said or whatever you're not dealing with you know you know fly-by-night lawyers either armed to the teeth with with really good people who know what to do and I think you know the people can they control themselves a little bit they do do wonderful things they did get an ordinance from the city of New York to be able to have some smoking facilities within the confines, but you know in some of the executives you know hold a cigarette you know in the picture every year and all that but I still think it is something that has proved detrimental and I've seen them I've seen him on television shows where they've been very calm and nicely dressed and say this is your choice and this is what you do I saw one show when Mario but used to be in Philadelphia if you remember back then before he is Chun and what national they had, somebody on from I think Philip Morris or Tobacco Company talked about all the M sport all of this evidence about smoking and how can it harm you and eat denied it and he said it's not really proven and I'm not saying I believed him but he had so many good things to say was so powerful in this presentation you want to Blink these are and that's the one leaky Impressions I had that they're changing their strategies to accommodate and that there are really are, also very bright people other stuff that they're changing their strategy someone else are they probably just changing strategy they actually changing their company changing the way they behave in the way they think I think there are group of this gentleman completely that he spent a hundred million dollars out of ten billion dollar profit annually in a PR effort I think they're very very bright people very Insidious people in there, on to be very successful people, Diana what kind of impression did you have this article well, number one the executive View, their job I mean their responsibilities to the organization the same way that other Executives get their responsibilities to be a particular organizations so they realize that the social issues are they are but on the other hand need you would as a necessary evil and I think somewhere in the article they, talk about their market share here in the United States and worldwide, and it's almost this underlying tone of, so far the United States has been the Forerunner in the and he's smoking but when you go around the world there's an anti-smoking movement doesn't exist or it's very going to school to be so therefore, they approach seems to be that people want to smoke and we're going to maintain and find ways in is less offensive the as possible to maintain or increase our market share we will try in the process to repair our image but there is a market for our products and we're going to go after completing our survey we tell the public about your research departments that are trying to draw, rough on nicotine cigarettes or e-cigarettes won't harm you if it's possible and if they are doing that kind of research but I don't think the public is aware that they don't educate the public that the great that they are trying to improve their danger to smoking you don't hear about a half that stuff the way you used to go low tar and Littlestown let's go on just as long as you don't they know it's crap and the public doesn't buy it I don't know if Linda what kind of what kind of reactions, image of the coming out but I think they should stop trying to convince everyone but they're not teenagers because I think statistics show that most people even some of the executives started smoking when they were teenagers so my perspective is they should just try to get out of it back not get out of it but try to get into other things and I don't see there they're making you think, they're going to change their strategy but I haven't really seen from this article how they doing there was a question I think it's the second one on the pink sheets that this article is this article positive neutral or negative towards Philip Morris how many people said this article is negative towards Fillmore's got ones that was negative towards but more somebody said it was neutral towards Fillmore's 12 and how many said it was positive towards Baltimore has one two three four, 456 can you look at Jim's and see what he said, neutral okay six positive three neutral one - someone who said positive tell me tell me why positive were you Jimmy Neutron father, give me positive Tom O'Connell sort of neutral tell me Peggy what stopping the advertising doing away with the Billboards and stop aiming toward kids you don't hear about them for a while you got to buy the cigarettes if you want to buy the cigarettes but they're not advertising like, which is good for me good yes I agree I think they understand that a lot of the criticism is coming from those people who feel that they are going for the younger people under age 21 so just like the liquor industry where there are you here in the commercials a little Adam one should be, what do you want to drink you know I think they're trying to move in that direction similar to the alcohol commercials that sometimes I hear them where they emphasize is okay to drink but you should be responsible for and bottom of the page is something about being 21 so I think that if they could they'd probably leave if they could overcome the public image of marketing to teenagers, they you know they want a large part of the battle and that this is an adult thing and adults make decisions to either smoke or not smoke and then you should wait until you're an adult to pursue that habits really come across this article is really trying to not want to Market to teenagers when they were interested train three thousand retailers to go recognized full site he's at because of positive Sean, it was written by somebody who's very aware of how to suddenly make it positive with outstanding defensive is very they made him seem like they made they made these five people to talk about very human you know we're not want out of monsters who you know he didn't the people again why neutral wonderful topic that's initial it's the Oracle toward Philip Morris the article is basically a series of, is with the top Executives from Philip Morris I don't think it was an article, that was saying Philip Morris is great or Felton Norris it's horrible it was just here's what it's like to work at for Philip Morris and then whoever wrote the article is very neutral like they filled in some facts and put some data in there and but they really didn't say anything like well Philip Morris's going in a good direction of moment that direction so they said what direction Philip Morris has gone into it it really talk about like the ethical Parts too much these kind of, of State some facts and here's how the top Executives feel about working for those companies, well you're out of the room did we ask how people voted on the second question pot was the article positive negative neutral We snuck a peek at your paper yeah usually sort of decision for what you want to explain why you gave a neutral thought it was either positive or neutral and and I went with neutral because it didn't come right out and say that, you know it's okay to do this you know what but the fact that it wasn't - that it is neutral makes it positive because it's a negative going here you know so it's even put neutral it's kind of like positively thank you know what I mean I mean you're going in the way the whole article is set up its the cover is the most you know viable reviled company almost no of front it's going to be there weren't conic of the other way but what about the cover what kind of impression is this picture on the, uh cover create where you can also flip back to it and look at it what kind of Impressions does that cover create only the come on tardy want to show you what we're all about it says come and says come inside for sure what we're all about we be filled more saying that we want to show what y'all up, and it Norman Rockwell's our CEO Norman Rockwell confused and missing red in the bottom it's like that had something to do with lines word, he looks confused he looks like yeah but I wanted to kind of what kind of images do you get from from the company where this man by looking at this picture, ladies ladies in the Bible Belt sort of God his name is like yeah it looks to me like he like a country preacher like they like the weathered face I mean he looks like a guy running for president, this kind of signifies the old Blue Chip company and they're backward a lot of times the way, they view how the world is today and this is the way we've been doing business interests commercials on TV this is the way we've been doing it doesn't for 80 years and that's what people are going to get and there's these new companies are coming in are like on a Cutting Edge it can either either it's like you represent is the old school and they're powerful and do whatever it wants to do great what kind of images conjures up when you see this coming, Bible is interesting and is mentioned I think someone closeness before I was hoping to get a little bit more perspective of the daily life there the average worker once we are able and I think you really get that and the more reason I chose - not anyone has made but I want to mention all the changes that everyone talked about many things are so positive I think you have to remember those aren't changes because they want to do they're trying to stabilize the bleeding they're paying out billions of dollars and was already renegotiated for more money, so these are not changes they're doing because they're just you know seen the light they're having these changes including a good at making changes because they have to I think you're Miss I think people respectfully I like the changes but I think it's wrong to think that doing them because of this you know their Judgement Day or the stuff that's in you think they'll go back to the old way after they get all the racket I think, but I think there's a lot of differences between companies and I think a lot of things they do or horrible there's something to be said credit go ahead go ahead and lie what you're saying I don't see, what they're doing in order to Stave off the criticism that anything different than what a lot of companies do whatever he could win it, I know I wouldn't be because I didn't think that when the heat is on people respond and if you never called the task and you just go back your business and do whatever and this has been there the culture and many Industries if it wasn't for federal regulations or unions or whatever this run roughshod over the people and learning why nobody is doing anything about it I think you're doing what any CEO of a company with your appointment and keeping in mind that, these people do not own the company company is owned by the public and they're fighting their best to protect the image in the in the profitability of the company for the public who owns 80% of the company, and check it is some of these talk orders a day on to be shocked it they really don't want as much stock as you think they did when it companies to get large salaries but each one of these CEOs I'm sure can go to any other company in the country and get to Maine the same kind of money because they're valuable people with brains, this guy who's the CEO Jeffrey Bible how does the article treat and how does the the reporter in this publication treat him how does he come across I guess is another way to say how does he come across, well I think very very well again I was neutral towards you article but I think you article you haven't realized it was written businessweek natural to my way positive slant to it absolutely yes a concern but I think the portrait of Bibles is very this positive as a cigarette the executive can get at I think it's all crap, there is a very successful strategy and it's probably a he's a good company to buy stock in, choose, Karen honey think he comes across town to Port right here I think it's a positive um they seems to like, he like, like he's stressed like he makes things better in only like anything they down on me up like he sounds like a like a guy that listens and then changes things and was a positive outlook on them, Tom how much you home so it's going to be a very powerful image the city stands there for the last cigarette like javelinas hand and nothing they went around they touched only if they try to create like The Human Side of them to I think I'm not sure if it was in there talk about the women's tennis there's no sponsorship deal with this plasticity got all chipped try to show a little bit of the other side, person to person, just with the first paragraph there that you know says you know, what did I do to make the world better that's what it's going to come down to, what do you think there is sort of this there's this one statement in the beginning about your measured by what you do on the arithmetic goes on and talks about you know what he's doing is ahead of a cigarette company what how is that how does that come across, how do you think this this reporter makes that sound how does that come across to you is he I think they tried to show some of the human qualities of me top management like how the one guy was, in a foreign country or can Aid relief for five years and fruit flies on the children's faces and they had done good things in their life and what they they had a sense of humanity it was just happens to be that they're working for a very successful company and an industry leader but they're working for a company in an industry that's in a very controversial, industry right now Jim well I mean I think they do a good job of make over all the teaser human guys who, I'm making a living and who are not actively trying to trying to destroy the world or try to try to hurt people so I mean cigarette smoking is a very popular everybody wants to which to burn and a culture where like stuff that's going on out there let's all get let's all gang up on cigarettes because you know it's proved he's sometimes the lesser of the year, I'm sort of being used by I was never I was never in the thick of cigarette smoker but so I don't have I don't have the passion for it they puny has but I really am like the whole how horrible it is and have people line up at you know to wave the flag at the the horrible devil of cigarette smoking when there's a lot worse those are out there was one of the questions they keep it keeps running, and through this the theme as they talked to the I guess the five corporate execs here is how do you answer the question right honey answer the big question how do you work for a company that kills people honey what's your feeling is you read through this article about that company gonna go ahead I'm not a psychologist here but they have rationalized it real well in their own mind really big time and and who am I to say that they don't believe what they're saying is true you know it's a real good at believing there's a lot of, there's a lot of people that rationalize things their own mind to what they believe it that was a big theme and at the say something before about you know there's some truth to say hey well what are we going to do not do it because the government says not to do it you believe in that philosophy of living here there's some truth to that statement and then I'd come back and say you have it in a we can't push it to the other extreme good character, just because there's pine it doesn't mean you have to go out and buy something the company should the state's I think it's coming more and it's probably more harmful because with that particular in stay educated enough to do it, it with the liquor they don't you don't see a start in the state store saying this may cause problems in your family well you know they've got every beer at service because you make was probably your family and every Soldier almost yeah well that's a very important factor they'll try to go ahead and Diane I think it also points out that the very clear contradiction because on the one hand the cigarettes a lawful in this country, and you have the you have the lobbyists that are holes of Congress and Senate I mean we're not about passing any laws here to ask you all the cigarettes so therefore these people who are involved with the cigarette business terrible awful business you know you can't you know it's almost like the government wants it both ways you know it's a lot of money tied up in it they're not trying to promote this fish, sure World prohibition which didn't work when they did with the alcohol back in the 20s but I think the government sends mixed messages I mean if you feel that strongly about it out Lord then the cigarettes are going to grab and you know that'll be another issue but they're not doing that they're just and I think these people realize that it's just you know they are the bad boys right now and I mean everybody knows the hadza to the dangers but the government is not going to go so, so far as to outgoing a problem and so since they're not going to do that it's a knew you would come is there anything that you read this article that you learned that you didn't know anybody here learn something new you did,or do you know all this that you lives in here, charitable contributions of charitable knowledge of a heart Craig anything in there you didn't know yeah actually smells asking the question about where cigarette smoking was at this point I think I mentioned it's going down a little bit and there are numbers of yeah and I wasn't anything in there you didn't know now I didn't have the particulars of the of the big guys at work for me, now there really wasn't that I thought the lawyer was the probably the strongest character in here he always had like a little work for these guys like an ACLU kind of mentality because everybody's down these guys are at work you know because because because it's the because what somebody was kind of saying hey they got a right they have they have legal rights and this guy I mean he had a quote in there that I thought was right about that you know it's legal, but I really now I caught when I saw the caller I kind of expected with pain from the decent picture of these people that that's what would happen showing anything you learned that you didn't know about these girls were all real skinny and tall are you they're doing it, this is what is inside there were pretty situation was good with their forty thousand dollars and if it's guaranteed any sizable multi-millionaire who could compare the things we did was a real familiar with the company like like the stuff is in here 8 out of 12 from the top executives are smokers and it wasn't that the number I didn't know I sort of need to know that but I guess you figured well it was there anything you remember that kind of stuck in your mind is gee I didn't know you're doing, that's kind of interesting that kind of reaction, I don't know if we're just checking rated Beer Company country never really focused on the fact that Philip Morris was the world leader in the tobacco industry and, you know I guess the Articles would imply that you know we're fighting this battle here but at the same time we're building new and great Frontiers in some of the developing countries that are you know long way we are with the social consciousness of the cigarettes and I think from that point of view if you look deeper into to it it's very - because, we always well frequently we here in the United States experimental people in developing countries with our pharmaceutical and now we're going to dump but we're going to go after those unsuspecting people with the tobacco market and these are people who didn't have the resources that we have such as the media the education government, but she's taken away some - okay Peggy how about you there anything in here you learn didn't receive the only exception in New York but they weren't I didn't know that okay and how about you okay let's talk about that what about the fact that they own crap Miller announced is that how does that reflect, act upon either them or on those other companies, there were they seemed like they were about 45 to do that before we came in here already but how does that reflect the fact that they could come out of this article is it more people would know the craft Miller are Catholic pope Morris because apart from Craft and Philip Morris and crafts and motor do a very good job of divorcing themselves exactly yeah you think after the - for craft to be carful Fillmore's valorous right, we think is that everything that I probably would help Philip Morris more than it would hurt crafter but agree with Linda yeah it's pretty important shall we, so they know there's always a parent company and crafts probably didn't have a whole lot to say about it maybe you need to see how the take those if you were if you were Philip Morris top management person would you have let the businessweek reporter have the access that he had to write this article yeah sure would you try to stop it try not to let it happen in here they used to not give interviews, and I said this was one would they let him have it so was it a mistake or the right thing to do right, you think this is the kind of thing more company should allow happen, let a reporter come in and watch what you do for a living ask you tough questions should be a nice Excellence now I don't I don't think you should do it if your backs against the wall like full of morons I think you should do it period to you if you're an open Honest Company it's very outside you couldn't buy this kind of an advertisement it makes you more of an open and honest company yeah I don't think most companies are afraid of, let me ask you this if if a you know one of these one of these top management guys was in the mood for advice what kind would you give based on what you've read here today with anything that they that's in here that they should be emphasizing more or something that's not in here they should say, it struck me about the last closing paragraph from they were saying yeah but you know how come it when you stood in front of Congress and said that you weren't addicted how do you how do you get by that all well we were we weren't like sure of the definition I'm like thinking of who saying well it depends what your definition of is is like who said that you know we're saying teaching clearing well you know what was your definition of is it addictive so I think they a lot of people pretty sad I think people are not as dumb as, I think they think the world could have been done by saying it's addictive but we're selling a legal addictive product as opposed to complete we don't think it's a big deal at all come on you seriously and then saying jumping on well we didn't know the definition which reminds you clean Baba saying it as what is is, serial sex okay anybody else has any advice you give these guys go ahead no I didn't get the whole way through the article but I would just say maybe provide the public with more of your strategies on what new business opportunities you plan to get into my I didn't really see that I kept feeling that's what they wanted but we talked about that earlier I got the sense that they weren't looking at all to get into new businesses the, only business they wanted was to expand their world market share but you think it'd be cause of divorce them Erica I'm getting this in several you think would be positive for them to diversify if they diversify if they moved into some other me two product lines, is that true, I don't think it is 66 percent of their profits from from tobacco why would they want to change that think they're already reversible, any other advice, let me let me just lastly go go quickly through a couple of quotes that were in here is your reaction to his highlighted for you the head guy Jeffrey Bible talked about how he changed his mind at one point recently with the last couple of years you're so when he was negotiating they decided to sit down with the critics and agree to that big national settlement to pay a hundred seventy five billion dollars they also agreed at that time to do things like actually absolutely give up the Marlboro Man as one of their own, their marketing tools how did that come about how does that come across, Craig you want to leave with that how does that come across to me I mean I respect it and I think it's better than before but I think it was there stating off the bleeding of what could have been much more disastrous than what they're facing Jim how about you yeah I stopped that was what I was almost ready have their backs against the wall in the wash another guy in there Szymanski I think his name is, he's the one who went told the story about the his house his wife The Reef but yeah the wreath was placed at his house and he said he when he's asked how does it feel to work the company work for I don't want to look I can't lose somebody else's life we can't remove risk from people's lives if they choose to do risky things that's their choice, he's right, does that come across as that, yeah I mean it's good Arc he also talked about how the company spending a hundred million dollars a year anti youth smoking campaign they don't do Billboards anymore and they train thirty thousand retailers to spot fake IDs they've got the basically making the point they're committed to trying to cut down on you smoking I don't buy that but yet we're still selling a billion a day right come on they've got the most Creative Marketing in the youth magazines and I want to read them, kids under the age of 21 or looking for advertising systems are smoking because their friends are saying they have nothing to do with the bill brought into our what they saw on the TV because there was a pretty bad in the book and most of them probably don't smoke the more specific you know for to divide is cheaper cigarettes yeah so it's called Moore's he's not selling as many cigarettes of children's I think people think children buying cheaper cigarettes it's a premium cigarettes very expensive today, py weird are back I think there's the head of the worldwide operations Who quote some of their statistics saying that they've got 83 in the 83 youth prevention programs going throughout the world in 55 countries he makes the quote we don't want kids to smoke because it exposes us to attack as an industry, how does that come across as he addressing the third world kind of issue is an international issue I think that's a very realistic statement if they come by the way again I think I said earlier to get the anti-smoking groups off of their backs of terms of I think the real issue is filled by the miners smoking, I think that you know is what helps to keep it alive so if you could somehow move the issue off of from that level then the link to it being an adult type of behavior I think you would see a lessening of the criticism right I guess finding is crap I think I like to see some statistics on what the programs are and how they're changing opinions there's a famous story of taking two seconds to tell you of a CEO from an HMO that died he woke up he wasn't he, so the Pearly Gates he said I can't believe I'm going to have any salsa same Peter and said I'm in heaven I can't believe it you know what I did is a CEO of an HMO I just threw people out of hospitals people who are sick and dying I said have covered wasn't enough I'm how can I be in heaven saying Peter Burton says it's okay you only have two days I really don't know anything wrong but Mars is still getting used to because I don't think that's their market like I said before so, Dollar Wise if you can't afford their product and they know it John posting us alone up its karma, they go after the kids because of the children more sacred but 12 gotta but it was fuel because they're trying to recoup medical costs because too many people are bleeding Medicaid dry because they're dying of cancer at 55 years old it's not about the 13 year old and the other and then they go for the emotional pitches that you know John he's 13 years old and he's gonna kill himself already but it was the only way that the attorneys in the class actions were able to do is to recoup costs for the state people bleeding the medic, paid Medicare system dry and those were mostly people over 40 but they use you're saying that use the kids as yeah he's dirty and health smoking he probably has like five bed Partners to die they will still work for me though what are they going to say these people are PR experts these people are all multi-billionaires I'm sure we'll find out about Jeffrey wigand or whatever his name was from The Insider I mean there's issues with that movie too but I guess the longer they want, the major questions I'm asking you here tonight one of the reasons why I'm here is because this article appearing in a business week does it does it change the way you think about the company from the way you came in at all raise your hand if your answer is yes how did it change you crib, good morning to meet interesting to see what they're going through and I'm interested to hear I don't have this perspective and I think a lot of its double-talk and I think a lot of its PR but a little facts like you mentioned about the exemption New York and where things are at I'm interested in their mindset you know and where they're at I don't believe everything I think what you touched on this is a very this is a test of a concern with this is not very important magazine is conservative and and there and there, strategy based on what the employees wanted as I said in the beginning the article is to accommodate and to deal with the media because they will be coming iconoclast and they were isolating themselves and they are pressed to the gills to do something and Pete and carefully and you can bet these guys met Ad nauseam before they grain of these interviews as to what to say and they all work with the same gobbly gook out of their mouth and I think ultimately it is your choice to smoke and I agree with you but we're not what Mike Mike about Mike, I thought my hope is that you don't sleep because you're tired is anybody in here smoker anybody married to a smoker Linda how did it change you I think just basically you like this company, these Executives a lot better after you read the article you just like them better, any particular reason well because they present that human aspect of their hands give to charitable organizations and they're good people and that type of thing they're really not the bad guys about how would you care how do they change my whole thing was I mean I don't smoke and I don't I don't like to be around people that smoke I think thanks but I would never turn a blame the company for it I got blamed you for being dollars nursing a sobering to hear me but I mean like I mean everything to blame the company for supplying cigarettes, well I as a business person that it's sold me on the company is this from that perspective it's a great article from Mars, Mike better to change you, well no worries you're really gonna change my opinion is the same thing you coming in okay maybe I missed your hand okay anybody else, anybody else want to make any comment we have a cigarette he won't let me keep the arm actually I think I needed for my next now you can keep my I don't know what you can keep it if you want I have enough one of the question what acid it was one guy in here the Miller CEO made a very strong statement but it's 17 and 20 year old Sons as I want them to smoke or drink what do you think about that when he says that, there's the guys ahead of of work yeah I think it was your choice my choice is my kids are good choices taking smoke guys a head of a beer company that's owned by cigarette company he's saying his kids just because he works there doesn't mean he's a drinker he was 21st, and foremost on the parent yeah that's a first, I wish I would like to know whether the kids smoke or drink well I think that the generation of the heaviest smokers which are the people now maybe qualities State class action suit two people have 50 over who came up in a culture with looking was quite acceptable when I first started smoking it was, acceptable thing to do with your hands and all your friends did it but my daughter is who, Ruffian generation we have a lot of Education about not smoking and I don't know of any of difference is look so I think in their case the education about the risk has paid off but in my case I've stopped smoking but I certainly was a generation where that's very early age of 13 or 14 it was the end thing to do in that whole idea of the, Bob wasn't out there yet but I really thought I really think it had a critical mass and I think that the 25 year olds and up don't smoke as much anymore but I think there's some 25 year olds or smoking more out in the family's done any studies on it I don't have any how many 25 year olds would admit it but I know what I see walk around okay and you're all lot more young people smoking than there were five years and they're under doing it in rebelling because they overdid the can smoke but it's substituting the cigarettes for, years ago when I was looking kind of stuff you know it's in I really I do not require one thing I would like to do is I'd like you to leave League watch the your paperwork in front of you just as it is and as you leave today sweet little ladies out front and they'll pay you for your time and pat yourself on the back because you were good you did your homework, and thank you very much thank you thank you and I'll pick everything up just leave it you can have the article you want sure,do you have kids, he

reflect input from you as well, this this document does not okay say it says on the top of this document that it's the 2014 mid-year performance discussion guide is that right yes okay and the employee name is Todd ruin who is he Todd was a district sales manager okay when do you remember what district he was in,I don't recall the district he was in however reading the document recalls to me the Nashville district and seeing the reference to payers also recalls to me the Tennessee responsibility he had okay, and did you supervise Todd ruin I did for a period of time after Jay Myers departure okay, and so you would have been Todd room supervisor in looks like mid-2014 yes okay and I guess my question is if you'll flip with me into the second page, it says cultural Hallmarks manager completes prior to discussion in that dark bar do you see where I'm at now yes okay did I read that correctly yes okay and then it says leaders assessment of employee demonstrating male and Kratts cultural homeworks do you see right it says that yes so and maybe I'm just incorrect it would appear to me that says manager completes prior to discussions so did you complete this section I did not okay do you know who would have, reading this it appears that Todd completed this himself okay and so looking downward says competitive yes I have delivered timely feedback to Representatives both via the fcr and verbal coaching during field rides do you know what that means, the statement yes ma'am as a district manager Todd represents that he provided feedback to his Representatives, by way of the fcr or field coaching report and also verbal coaching as he rode along with the sales representatives okay so I think I understand so where it says manager completes prior to discussion that would be the district manager not the manager that's written on the top of the form on page 1, So reading the form in the way it was intended to be completed yes the manager would have completed cultural Hallmarks commentary prior to discussion in this instance this individual completed this part himself okay that clears that farm and thank you very much okay you can set that aside, I believe before you were speaking with mr. chalice about the copay and PPI report, the card yes okay and did you receive reports on co-pays and ppis challenge I don't recall specific reports although I would

refresh your recollection at all as to how often you would have received the reports yes okay and how often would that have been this email States every Tuesday and Friday okay and do you recall the time when that stopped you stopped receiving reports or Tuesday Friday I don't recall that all okay and what would you do with the reports when you received them, these reports would be useful too, use along with TRX information just to have an overall assessment resource utilization when it came to this particular resource okay and you would monitor the copay and ppis from Physicians all over the country is that correct, objection of the report included redemptions from across the country and across the country but also include redemptions from Tennessee yes okay thank you Mommy can set that aside, okay and then my last one here, we are going to Mark as Mallinckrodt chick exhibit 24 at Bates number is mnk underscore T NS ta 0 2 5 8 2409, okay do you recognize this document ma'am yes okay what is it a video this is appears to be an email forwarded to me from Jane Eyre the region director not long after I began at Mallinckrodt from one of his district managers okay and did you know

internal discussion about moving from least company cars to a car allowance or a lease management program managed by run timer okay it looks like that didn't happen it did not administers there and

gfhb0039,"how about yourself Gina mean if you did you get it did you talk to other smokers about the cigarette or not yes I did I get two packs away one to a police officer who sits in a closed car all day and she liked the idea that the car the cruiser was not full of smoke and I wish I had given a pact to my son Virginia because my granddaughter has asthma and he has to go outside and smoke and I I didn't do it I should, yes I was stingy kept most of them for myself what how do you I mean like I ask Rick if you had this a look personally what was what was most attractive to you what was the biggest benefit for you as you would explain someone else hey look you need to our try this thing and here's what it's about how do you what do you focus on when you talk about the health part of it very big and the idea that you know you're not burning something that's going inside you okay, other than the the health issue that was that we talked about is there are other issues that doesn't smell up the house okay talk to me for a second about that I mean did you is that something that you personally know yes I have a small small house in the living room small and when you come in from outside and smell cigarette I don't enjoy that I don't like enjoy smelling cigarette smoke after in the Attic Dan on spray the you do not have to do that the house stays free and, I was told I haven't had enough cigarettes to make that type of a test they say it will not yellow the walls, and won't yellow your windows and my other cigarettes do every time I wash it television screen it's yellow yellow and black from cigarette smoke and so I understand it will not do that and that's just I'd like to fight math either of y'all smoke in your car yes both okay have you ever noticed that film that gets in your car window and you smell talk to me for a second if you you know if you did notice, any difference with this cigarette it's not you know when go on to another subject but it either y'all notice anything I never really noticed as far as the windows or anything goes but I guess just common basis would think that water and glycerin versus tar and nicotine which is going to stick Like Glue and water I think the glue stick yeah yeah it's I think that's the other aspect like she said about you're not drawing in tobacco we're not blowing it out either you're not trying it in and I could be blowing it out it's going to keep things cleaner, as far as the smell and everything else goes okay Rick is a question for you yeah you're out you know let's say you're out talking to another smoker about this thing and they go wait a second I thought you said no you know 90% less secondhand smoke but I still see a lot of smoke coming out of your mouth so what's going on here well you take a drag off of your cigarette employee remove watch yours and you watch mine and let's see who stands around longer you don't see it going, they have their own second and I can guarantee their Kyle shut up because it's the truth how do you explain them and we go what does that work well from what I understand from the the course basically we went through is that by using a high-resolution filtered carbon tip and wrapping it in spun and woven glass you can actually heat it such as a barbecue where you actually cook, the tobacco thus instead of pulling the tar and nicotine by burning it you're actually pulling 85% water and glycerin and 15% card nicotine versus the 80% or better of tar and nicotine in a regular cigarette maybe 15 to 20 percent water and glycerin now water and glycerin is as far as people are concerned they think oh that's kind of good but what people don't know is when you heard about those millions of ingredients excetera you know what I mean it was the point that what people don't understand is you have to have water and glycerin in the cigarettes that, keep them fresh I work at a farm stores have been working there seven years I have cigarettes such as Pall Mall 100's that I wouldn't sell the people they sat in the store for over a year and when they saw I want to come on you've got them so I'll take him and I'll crunch the cigarettes form French the packet they can you hear this your cigarettes would dry brittle and just they're stale as can be if you want to buy them fine but I'm letting you know ahead of time now if you've got something that the water and glycerin dries up out of well then in that case I'm cigarettes, twice as bad because now all you're doing stuck in a tar and nicotine but something here you're never ever be sucking in straight to our next game because you're not burning it I mean for the if there's any my neat little bit of tobacco and then that you can gets charred to be a miracle actually and the nice part about the resolution tip is there's no Mass but the meantime it gives you a good six to seven minutes smoke such as a piece of charcoal we do it Cooks your meat for a while and it burns out and dies there's no mess you can lay it down you can you know you can fill your ashtray with them and you, don't have a magic pick them up the hill tonight that's right he's clean okay it's moisture and the stuff that dry tobacco like he said well they showed us with and that's why it doesn't scratch your throat because it's its moisture okay what what do you think the Public's reaction is going to be this let's say eclipse is now in the marketing genius mm what do you think I mean let's say there's a lot of eclipse we could be amazed because I was, it in what way when what are they what's our what's the world the smoke more what could it potentially happen let's say that everybody smoking it quits the only you know everyone ends up liking it and you know like Rick and although this would never happen What would the world be like if everyone were smoking too close I think would be great but I can't I can't predict that things are to stranger what about you Rick you have any feelings about that well I think very first thing is going to get Susan can skepticism right all throughout everybody's waiting, I want to know how I don't believe this is just too good to be true there's nothing bad about it but everything's good how can this be it's a cigarette but then if people did find out every people didn't try you're never going to get everyone because there's different people for different different cigarettes but the meantime you're gonna find out I think a lot of people would really try it simply because of the cigarette out there and because of what it does when you hear about something like that if you're going to spend the same amount as what you're going to spend for your pack of kools or Salem's or marbles why not spend $2, and see if you can help yourself if you can help yourself and help other people around you and eventually they look at it as the fact of you can actually smoke around people that normally don't smoke my sister she's got three boys and her husband has been dropped down to bring our smoking in a laundry room 4x4 he pays the house payments and I came down a recently for that but the point of it simply is because of the smoke in the boys and the attitude and the health factors but what of all the sudden he was blowing out water into the air, which humidifier does anyway things like that also maybe you might be able to come back in and smoke cigarette when he's watching his movie instead of well I guess I'll go outside real quick Miss for but seven minutes and smoke a cigarette so I feel better that's that's something if people could find that out and people start trying it you're gonna have a lot of people who don't know why this is this is going to be something that it will go over in it it will revolutionize smoking and maybe everybody would should pick up the cigarette and try it if they did well, kind of throw a couple of companies out of business but in the meantime to it would it would help people around for all benefits Health neighbors atmosphere there's just there is a lot of benefits there's a whole lot and it sounds kind of strange coming from so maybe a cigarette benefits there really is though I mean if it was just there's only one or two things out of it that would be one thing if you were still sucking down heavy tar and nicotine levels that would be one thing but you're not, it's completely different and yet it still tobacco and it is still a cigarette it just doesn't have all the things and added into it simply because it doesn't need to you're pulling the flavor out you're not smoking the tobacco and that in my book I think that's what's going to turn it over the more people do try it the more they'll tell others in the more they'll tell others in the more they'll tell others and eventually you're going down there a lot of people out there goes to hey I'm gonna spend my two bucks why not get the flavor and spend the same two bucks as I am right now and knock them, killing myself as I said earlier it's the point of 18 milligrams of tar 60 milligrams versus one means I can smoke 16-18 cigarettes this is what we get when I'm going to smoke in the next 20 minutes if I was to light up one of my marbles and yet I love my mom bro but that's pretty good benefit of you ask me I smoked a lot of cigarettes all right now this remember these videos will be watched by people and in rentals okay when they get back no look at this one what's going on out what people feel alright let's say there's someone back there it says well, there's no market for this cigarette I don't think we should even waste our time and money to Mark the cigarette what do you what do you say to them right I think a man needs to re-evaluate the cigarette industry because there are so many people out there now that smoke and there's so many people that are really getting a fold over what the government is doing to us and how they are taking away every right we've ever had that he would definitely need to have to sit back and think about this for a minute because unless it tasted totally horrible and nobody would want to pick, get up then there is a market there always will be a market for something that's going to be better be better for you and still is comfortable and taste good if it didn't taste good well then it wouldn't sell but maybe that man must be a nonsmoker that I gets a cigarette of the future it's and we need it now I think it's great, where else is there to go I mean this is amazing badges I want a smoke I don't want to quit - no because you know you had some topics you want to definitely talk about and since we only have two minutes left what let's go ahead and get those out oh the thing I'm very concerned about and I was wondering if they'd be like in the packaging if they could have another piece of, cardboard here to put your instead of them I'm afraid they'll be in the street and at that that yes that concerned me okay and I thought you know where you could just as you take them out you could put put them back in somehow yeah they're they're looking at a number of different things right and there will be good devices one thing is in there looking at is putting in the carton a real thin with their Corner Pocket ashtray it's just real thin and you can fill it up with those four five six of them and then dispose them when you get a chance another thing is the back, what you're talking about is like a honeycomb pack where you can just slide them right back in there something that you could just yeah somehow so you don't drop them on the street because even the regular cigarette that's what really concerns me about that matter any other topics oh sometimes I wish I had just maybe a spec more flavoring in there did you try to talk to me for a second if you did try both Styles yeah now just this is the only style that I've tried okay why can't I don't, like mental no I didn't try that good we ought to try those real quick let's go back and forth if there's one word if you could just use this as you know what one word describes a cigarette Rick won't you, exciting, oh definitely can you do it again and use it on Center if I had to pick one word to describe Eclipse it would be exciting but give me that sentence so we have a person oh it's uh thing yeah if I had one word to sum up the eclipse I would have to use the word exciting, it was not EG exciting and amazing I think it's an amazing thing I can't imagine, whose head this came from how did they invent this and I think it's wonderful okay where do you get on with it bring it on the market what should the government's position now the government has taken a position on smoking and it is no smoking in government buildings no Smokin in the military sector what's the what should the government's attitude be toward the cigarette Rick I think they should look at the benefits and see what it can do and instead of arguing and get the point about cigarettes which people are going to smoke anyway whether, they stand outside they store or across the street and then let's County Schools I go right near the superintendent's of vehicle across the street getting stand in the parking lot smoke cigarettes yeah it's going to help these people that are going to smoke anyway let's give them a little bit of leniency if all the sudden

Morelli you've got exhibit 20 in front of you and I will tell you for the record it's a portion just cut down on Forest loss of the entire presentation and I wanted to turn your attention to the back page, which is headed team membership and this is a list of people in, medical Affairs in the first row correct yes just hand it then says who does what on strategy and development team Excel go implementation team pain Sade implementation team and then generic products implementation team who it says, everyone in PPS is in on the generic products implementation team is that a rims team or what what's being implemented yeah there were certain there were certain generic products that had certain FDA requirements for certain things that we had to do and that's that's what that was and then PV what part of medical Affairs was that, I've forgotten if we call pharmacovigilance and that was Danielle Eddie and Danielle said he's a physician Danielle is a pharmacist but for specifically for generics implementation oh Danielle yeah okay and that's again just to do with the rims that was all that you guys had to do with any generic that, required rims from the FDA, so yes there are elements of safe use put it that way because this is so far back some of these it was before Rems ekron a lot Lorenz rims came in and 2007 so it was pre rims but it was still certain safe to use telephones that we had to do okay but I mean 2007 you hadn't even arrived eval right run but so that's when the legislation came in okay all right, and now let me, we done with this one yeah okay, I've got it, sorry, 21, okay,are you have you read it mr. where I am okay this is an email string between yourself and Rod Hughes with some other Cece's on it yes and the subject line from mr. Hughes is prescription painkillers: company's attempt abuse proof OB voice opioids hey, see news correct correct and then mr. Hughes rights to Joanna schooler was she in medical Affairs know she's Communications person Joanna I'm sure you have this but I wanted to highlight this just in case it is remarkable how Purdue has positioned their product as abuse proof they did this by, by showing no data the exact algo abuse deterrent features are just as good if not better than oxycontin's in fact that tablet also uses poly Ox as the excipient and I read that correctly you didn't was there poly Ox in Excel go, I don't recall but I believe there was okay and what is you recall was the function of poly ox, it was an excipient, which means to it was a non active ingredient but part of the formulation and what, what did Polly Ox had to the drug I mean did it read more bioavailable I don't know okay, and you think Excel go may have used it as well it may have did it have any potential abuse deterrent reason to be in either Oxycontin or in Exile do I don't know action of one all right, and your comment too, what mr. Hughes wrote to Joanna was another reminder of who we are dealing with and why our industry has the problems it does, we must lead right we Covidien correct and, who we were dealing with was Purdue, the industry in general quite frankly and why did you art Morelli believe that in 2020 11, the industry the pharmaceutical industry or more narrowly the opioid pain space which one were you targeting injection of one well this email was about the opioid pain space but I was making a more general statement, okay not to exclude opioids but to include them in that and explain to me your phrasing of this is why our industry has problems why don't have the primary article here so I really can't comment definitively on that but the overarching statement is, you don't have an abuse deterrent indication don't try to petition your product as abused to turn well in from the art Morelli who has, appeared today don't make that statement without showing data that supports it corrected even if your data even if you have data that's helpful but it's not definitive you have to have the indication to promote and position your product as of used to turn and so, were you, expressing, your frustration and having to be in competition with a company who you thought ignored the principles of Pharmaceutical, safety and Reporting objection to form not so much no I would just think rather than compare ourselves to other companies we just know what's right and we have to lead with what we know is right, and what was the industry-wide problem that you were referencing objection to form, well it's quite well known that the perception of the public perception of pharmaceutical industry is pretty low and stunts like this can't possibly be helpful that's what I was thinking of when I wrote this, and mr. Hughes wrote back that he agreed right did you ever sit down and have a discussion with mr. Hughes I don't recall about this series of events I had many discussions with mr. Hughes but not not specifically about this that I remember okay, when you decided to leave Mallinckrodt, part of it you said was, not wanting to remain in st. Louis correct it was it was a big part the biggest part actually okay you also though had or just into the not the launch but the development of excel go correct oh no we're going to form well after the launch okay and you put in your Rams put in the Realms of Realms of fully approved and in place the cares Alliance was fully developed and, because it launched in 2010 at the pain week meeting and the team was in place established and you know it's like I guess leaving it leaving it at your Peak kind of concept, how did it is alko Du did you keep track of your little baby after you left objection form, very very lightly if not at all you know maybe in a discussion on the phone with herb here and there but that would that would be about it I never saw data or I never really had any insights or did you get enough information to determine whether or not it had been a hit drug or a so-so drug or a drug that never quite caught on objection to form, I can't comment on that I don't know, is it still on the market, genericized yeah, then I do know genericized with the oros or genericized just as overalls tuner corals, okay, and what did you do immediately after leaving Mallinckrodt, laughter Mallinckrodt I worked with Paragon RX the Rems development company I'm various rims projects that they had throughout the industry especially almost exclusively the companies in California any of them opioids those Realms that you were yeah getting together yeah they were and where they branded opioids or were they, expanded have you ever had discussions with going back to work for Covidien know, has anyone else that we you had a good working relationship left Covidien and spoken to you about it, no you said that you had, maybe I overheard it talks with art Newman that you would have brought something up if you knew about it have you had discussions with the seat dr. Newman I've had many discussions with dr. Newman I've had many interactions with dr. Newman and I worked with dr. Newman on subsequent projects okay what have you worked with him on the Ohio State Initiative for cancer Enlighten the, advanced cancer Imaging company I think those are the only two and both of those are kind of long long duration kind of engagements as mr. Newman still at Covidien oh no he left after I did but soon after did you have her trade stories about your days at Covidien with dr. Newman sorry privileged and confidential, that's a new privilege that's not recognized but we were friends were friends our wives our families were friends so I'm assuming that you did have talks with him in which you said, unless you had no frustrations during the time when you were at Covidien here's what I couldn't take or here's what drove me crazy when I was at Covidien telling it to dr. Newman very little action to form dr. Newman moved to California from st. Louis we were became you know you know closer to each other on the map so there was more potential to interact with each other he's in the Bay Area, yeah but his wife's a doctor so we have a lot in common and we're just close friends and you know whenever you work anywhere there's always frustrations but, that I'm at a level of experience where I can kind of roll with the punches so they don't bother me so much having met you and spoken to you today it is as you said in an earlier answer that you had a very high principle and one of the things that I take away from being able to ask you questions today is that your personal approach to safety was it was an all or, thing bottom line thing that pharmaceutical companies needed to address especially in the open space did I get that right I tried to adjective form try to do that to the best of my ability yes and was there ever any frustration that could videon was not, as Ardent about that as you were judging the form I wouldn't I would say no you know whenever you're at a company and you're managing you know projects that are big expensive projects there can always be the potential for the feeling that you know well they going to continue and that's just the normal operations of things, but the Covidien you know I what I was doing was supported by herb, and the CEO tomb right I always felt like I had really good support and belief in the importance of what we were doing so they were very little on the frustration scale quite frankly and what you were doing during the time you were an employee was all if not exclusively greatly the majority in Excel go through it was young and and the cares Alliance, and you can't tell me haven't been able to tell me today much about what was going on in the generic opioids face even within Mallinckrodt truth I had very little interaction awareness knowledge with the generic business and the people in the generic business, let's go off the record for just a second time is 528 4548, we're back on the record the time is five fifty-one p.m. hey good afternoon mr. Marley how are you doing fine how are you great I am Trisha her svelte and I am an attorney representing the plaintiffs in Tennessee do you know anything about the Tennessee litigation no okay on before we get started I just want to Lodge our usual objections to late production of documents non-compliance with the mdl protocol and the other objections that we've lodged in the other, missions I'd like to renew them at this time we disagree with your characterization regarding our compliance with the mdl protocol we have complied but we know your direction okay great now we'll move on I'm okay so you don't have any awareness of the Tennessee litigation sir I do not okay, okay and you've been to Tennessee before is that correct I've been to Tennessee how many times did you say you've been I've been to Tennessee once in my life okay and with that for work no hey what was it for my daughter's swim meet at the University of Tennessee when she swam at Arizona State oh okay very good you haven't been to Tennessee for work for me you have not been to Tennessee for work no okay, okay I'm when you were talking earlier about hot spots for pill Mills you mentioned Florida obviously and then Kentucky and West Virginia would you consider both of those states to be in Appalachia fictional form I don't know really can I think they might be but I'll rephrase the question would you consider Kentucky and West Virginia to both be States contained within Appalachia yes okay and would you consider Tennessee to be part of the Appalachian, and region know and have you heard it all about pill Mills being a hotspot in Tennessee I have not, do you recall having any conversations with anyone about particular opioid abuse problems in Tennessee I do not, do you know what neonatal abstinence syndrome is I do and what is it to your knowledge neonatal abstinence syndrome is a condition where newborn goes through opioid withdrawal because they were exposed in utero to the mothers consumption or use of opioids you know what region of the country has the highest number of Naas births no but I bet you're gonna tell me, happy if you don't know hey have you ever known no is that an information you've ever endeavored to obtain, would you be surprised to learn that Tennessee's number two directional form I would be neither surprised or disappointed or anything is it is what it is the data is what it is probably isn't is what it is though for those babies I don't know it's terrible it's a terrible thing have you ever seen videos of baby's going through withdrawal from opioids and performs I have seen some videos because of my work at Dupont with Narcan and dark and neonatal which is used in that setting, you and how would you describe watching those videos of those babies after they're born guess objection ghastly ghastly ghastly you think they're in pain objection to form don't know but they're in distress certainly, you knew that there was opioid epidemic specifically in Florida is that correct no it's not exactly correct I knew there were a lot of pill Mills the pill Mills that I were aware of we're in Florida and they were is an opioid epidemic you know an opioid problem was more pervasive than just Florida okay yeah and, I'm going to show you what number are we on for exhibit okay well we will Mark and number 22 great thank you, okay mr. murali what I've handed you here appears to be an email from person named Chris De Fusco do you know who Krista Fusco is I do and who's Christopher Fusco he is an employee at Mallinckrodt in the, think of the business development I think is what he was in when I was there okay and on Business Development did he handle any of the opioid product so okay and just for the folks on the phone and the record that Bates number on this is mnk hyphen T1 underscore 00:06 317 909 it's a one-page document and what is the date on this email mr. murli 3 29 2010 okay, this email is sent to Deborah Hass Hass Hass can see and speak to you and to David silver is that right okay and who is Deborah hasse she was a co-worker of Krista Fusco okay and so she was a mailing proud employee yes okay and David silver he was the Deborah and Chris reported to David silver okay and so David silver was also a Mallinckrodt employee okay and this email was sent to the three of you on March 29th 2010, n is that correct that's correct okay do you have any reason to think that this email wasn't sent to your email address no I'm sure it was okay I'm and what could you be the subject for me there please hey speaking of the subject News expose Oxycontin Florida and Tennessee okay and then what is the email site speaking to one of the folks I met from grunen Thal in Portugal in the training class in Barcelona last week about our paint products and he mentioned a News expose, out the problems with the abuse of Oxycontin in Florida and Tennessee and I thought you might find it interesting and then I do you speak Spanish at all I do not okay and so underneath that it says T2 though right oxy Express that what does that teach you to oxy Express red B TC oh okay very good okay and so do you know why it is that Chris would have sent an email specifically to you David and Deborah fictional form no I don't know why he sent it okay it did you respond, to this email I do not recall okay do you know if you ever had any conversations with anyone where you looked into an oxy abuse program or an oxy abuse problem in Tennessee I do not okay but according to this email which was 2010 the very least then you had received information about the oxy Express involving Florida and Tennessee is that an accurate statement I received this yeah I may be other things that I was exposed to all the way, okay but at the very least received this in 2010 I guess I did okay and can you think of anything else you might have been exposed to along the way that would have alerted you to an oxy abuse problem in Tennessee just news releases you know perhaps okay and I'm going to show you what will Mark is the next exhibit, 23:23, okay and this is oh yeah do you need a minute this is what happens when you mark them I'm sorry I'm a very fast just cough and then I'll slow down that's what they usually do with me, okay for folks on the phone this is mnk hyphen T1 underscore 00:07 2002 16 and it's a one to three page document, okay mr. Marley have you had a moment to look over this email, yes generally yes not in detail but yes okay let's kind of just go through it for for one second I'm not going to ask you to know everything in it does this appear to be an email that was sent from a person named Steven Littlejohn to you on February 19 2011 yes okay and it also copies Joanna schoolers that rights right and do you have any reason to believe you didn't receive this email in the ordinary course of business no I don't, the subject here is re wsj fight over a fix for Florida pill Mills do you see where it says that, yes okay and who is Steven Little John Steven Little John was a guy was the VP of the Communications Department for Mallinckrodt, for mailing don't cry and who is Joanna schooler she works in Little John's Department okay so also a male and crowd employee yes okay, and so if you look at the email that's being forwarded it looks like it says from Joanna kind of mid where the pages FYI more on the floor issue in Florida and the ongoing State funding debate will make contact with the reporter and that sent to a whole bunch of folks do you see that is that a yes, is that a yes that's yes yes okay sorry I have to get you to say yes it doesn't work on my transcript okay and then it looks like you reply on at 8:50 in the morning so it looks like, just shortly shortly there later I'm could you reach a response to Joanna there yes this article brings out some excellent points pro and con of pmps, the problems remain however, I see here a way for us to bring in a best practices orientation rather than a good or bad approach and our idea of changing the dialogue from problem identification and blame two solutions we need to contact Keith Humphries the Stanford PMP researcher named in the article Bobby and I can do that Bobby some of the works for me do you agree, okay and I reiterated education collaboration Innovation which is a strategy for the cares Alliance okay and so did did you ever reach out to the Stanford PNP researcher named in the article Keith Humphries I don't recall doing that now okay and do you know if I'm Bobby did I don't know okay, okay I'm, and then if you'll go down and actually read the article get to the second page here, you believe based on your email response to this that you did read this article that rights are at the time, I believe I did yeah okay so I'm just going to kind of bring you to some of the more pertinent points okay I'm going to ask you questions about the very first line in the article says State Line Miami do you see that very second the second page yes okay Florida Governor Rick Scott's called cancel a state drug monitoring program has sparked an uproar and Appalachian State's that say they are deluged with illegally bought pills from South Florida pain clinics do you see where it says that is, yes sir yes yes it is yes I see it yep okay and so was there a concern from Mallinckrodt about the PMP Pro State drug monitoring programs injection of Point can't speak for male and cried but I can tell you that I'm very I would be very concerned about the cancellation of any PMP program that I'm very concerned about the lack of utilization of pmps around the country okay and the delayed various problems with pmps it's one reason why they're not utilized and they're underfunded, they have problems with their data and speed of updating and that's a barrier to adoption for Physicians so there are potentially very valuable tool and then if you'll move down with me a little bit further on it says Jason Henry for the Wall Street Journal about halfway do you see there, no where were you at where you at oh I see the next one okay okay and then if you kind of keep going down it says pill Mills have flourished in Florida especially in Broward county in recent years week standards governing who can set them up a lack of oversight by state agencies and the absence of prescription monitoring programs have contributed to the problem said Sherry green chief executive of the nonprofit National Alliance for model street drug State drug laws did I read that correctly you did do you agree with that I agree with it, okay now the next one says according to the Florida Attorney General's office clinics are often casually Enterprises employing doctors who write prescriptions for painkillers without examining patients you see where it says I do and were you aware that that was happening it happens it happens yes it does okay and would you characterize situations where that happens is a pill Mill tricks in the Forum no not necessarily they could be but it certainly improper and could contribute to the diversion of, into the illegal drug Market absolutely and the next sentence there says they have proved to be a magnet for buyers in the Southeast period according to Frank Rapier director of the Appalachian high intensity drug trafficking area highway patrol offers officers and hot spots like Eastern Tennessee routinely Stop Van loads of people returning from Florida with fresh stock piles of prescription drugs did I read that correctly she did and does this, refresh your recollection at all about whether Tennessee was identified as a hotspot clearly what they're saying here it is okay and had you heard of the Appalachian high intensity drug trafficking area never heard of it no okay and do you know who Frank Rapier is I do not have you ever had a conversation with him I have not okay but you agree with this statement that Florida was a hot spot for those drugs to be brought up into the illegal drug Market direction of one I do agree, and specifically into the illegal drug Market in Eastern Tennessee, yes what it says here I have no basis to do so agree with it okay and then in the next line it says in West Virginia state senator Evans Jenkins Evan Jenkins said flights on discount Airlines between Huntington West Virginia and Fort Lauderdale Florida have been dubbed the Oxycontin Express and before I think we you'd been asked if you'd heard the term Oxycontin Express or oxy Express and I don't remember what your inside I hadn't heard okay and have you heard of ice, 75 being designated as the oxy Express injection before - I have not okay, okay can take this document and set it aside please we done with this one yes sir, I'm going to hand you the next exhibit which will be marked as exhibit number 24, there's that, I don't know that I have as many Kathy's here guys have to share, okay for the record this is mnk hyphen T1 under two of these well you got to, underscore 000 429 8470 and it puts you page document, okay sir some very familiar with this okay what is it sir so this is this is an agenda for a quarterly Rems safety board meeting these occurred quarterly okay with our panel of experts we where we presented data they for their review and feedback and action items that we would take and make, into actionable plans okay and if you will look here on the very first page the speaker that's designed from 9:35 a.m. to 950 AM that you that's me okay and did you indeed speak at this I did okay and does this maybe refresh your recollection as to whether you've been to Tennessee for business I forgot about Nashville I've been actually I've been to Nashville many many times I just completely forgot about you have you know most people don't forget Nash I know I'm really sorry because I've been to Nashville Maybe, and times and I just blanked out that's okay so why don't you tell me other than this will come back to this agenda okay and just a second but the other times that you've been to Nashville has that been for business or for personal both it meant mainly business and when I worked for Cardinal Health Cardinal Health had a big facility in Nashville okay it was a third party Logistics distributor company I used to go there you know you know a number of times, it's okay and so when you were working for Cardinal Health and you would come to Nashville for that distribution issue or meetings did any of that have to do with the diversion of opioids and the prevention of diversion of opioids okay okay and so other than your time with Cardinal Health and other than personal times other than this meeting that we just talked about have you been to Nashville for business reasons for any other times, not that I can remember no okay and so let's go back to this meeting then that you had here on April 8th and 9th 2011 at the Loews Hotel in Nashville is that correct that's correct okay and do you recall that lows being across the street from Vanderbilt University I do checks because I went running on the campus it's pretty and it's beautiful yeah it's very good okay so I'm looking at this agenda I see that it's you speaking and then we have some other folks I just want to make sure I understand who they are I think, already a discussion about Lynn Webster so I don't think we need to ask about Lynn that's the same limb Webster that was discussed earlier is that correct okay and what about Herbert Newman who is the chief medical officer of kovarian okay direct supervisor and so he would be a Covidien Mallinckrodt employees all right yes okay and then Daniel Burrows who is Daniel Burrows Danielle was a pharmacist and worked in pharmacovigilance at Mel, grunts okay and then Bobby Clarke who is Bobby Clarke Bobby Clarke is an epidemiologist to was on my patient and product safety team not a Mallinckrodt employee yes was a melancon employer he was he was okay I'm Julie Milford who is Julie Milford I actually don't know okay how about Jeanne Wang NBA Kenny Wayne worked for me okay so on the patient product safety team so she would have been mown Crowder for the unemployed, okay, I think that covers everybody that was on the list is that sound correct it does okay and so the people who attended this conference would that have been on just people that run on your Advisory board or would have been open to other positions or no driver's it was it was a the purpose of the meeting was to present data on the use side effects reported problems program success of the example gold rims, and Exile go to these experts for their to give them an opportunity to weigh in on the data and give us their impressions of what was really happening behind the data so they were interpreting the data okay and who were the experts injection of form it was Deborah Gordon was one David Brushwood I think I went through this before they want me to tell you who they were or is it the same less that you went there before what, yeah and there were others I can't remember all but there were a few more yeah okay and do you know if there were any Tennessee prescribers that were there oh no prescribers would, Tennessee prescribers prescribers were not invited to the meeting okay I'm do you know if there was anyone who was from Tennessee for based in Tennessee that was at the meeting at the time I don't know exactly but at the time Steve pasok may have been an employee at Vanderbilt I know it one time he was but I don't know if at this particular time he was working at Vanderbilt and you can set that aside, thank you sir, okay I'm going to hand you will Mark as collected exhibit 25, together I think the boys do here, okay for the record I just handed mr. Morelli what we've marked as plaintiffs exhibit 25 the Bates number is MN K Dash T 1 underscore 000 790 1956 looks like, like they have copies of email twice I don't know if you guys have two pages or one but it should be a one page email with an attachment, and the attachments placeholder page is mnk hyphen T1 underscore 000 790 1957 so it's email and attachment okay mr. Morelli if you'll just take a look at the email for one second for me please, okay you see the email I do okay and this is an email that was sent from Regina Ruben to you and it looks like a whole bunch of other people on October 8 2009 is that correct that's correct okay and do you have any reason to believe that you didn't receive this email in the ordinary course of your business no, so you believe that this email is something that you received I do okay and so who is Regina Ruben Regina Ruben is in was an employee of farm Paragon RX the consulting firm we use to run everybody through the RX f ma a process in terms of building safe use tools okay and Jeremy steamer do you know who that is Jeremy steamer is a melon crowd employees and a date, the analytics division of prescription data analytics in Mallinckrodt and what is prescription data analytics do so data comes in through a data service and it's quite voluminous and people like Jeremy steamer and his team would would get inside the data and kind of translate raw data into kind of usable actionable information understandable information rather than a page full of numbers, okay yeah okay and if you look at this email looks like Regina is forwarding something to you and a bunch of other folks on where it says attached is Jeremy Steamers presentation from this morning's core team TC thanks Regina did I read that correctly and do you know what she's referring to when she's talking about a core team TC injection of them I do not know what TC what the context in which he's using TC maybe it's core team backwards or something I don't know, no teleconference movie it could because we did it verbally and then he followed up with hard copies yet I think that's what it is okay and core team would be which team is that the co videon exha go Rems so let's look at this, so the the to the to line on this cover memo is a wait there's more job, so this is a laundry list of employees at Paragon RX and employees at Covidien who were involved with the RX-7 be a process okay okay now if you'll flip with me to the this is the attached I'll submit to this is the attachment we've printed out here the PowerPoint on let's take a look at the first page, the title page here it says exalt go Rams which I think we talked about a lot already today a commercial analytics perspective what is a commercial analytics perspective correction form so, in the process of operating the rims operationalizing the rims we need to collect data that, tell us who's prescribing the product how much product is being prescribed where it's being prescribed all those prescription data analytics because that data has to be presented to the exact algorithms safety board okay and that's data we use to try to understand if the product is being used appropriately at least from a data analytics perspective and if there's any hot spots or things that look, bad we need to dig into that further okay because that would be responsible thing for Mary Pratt to do if you have that data want to dig into it further and find out if your product is being abused or misused or diverted is that right direction to form okay okay I can page, okay Market overview data and information needs and implementation strategy yes switch to the next one okay then it talks about Market overview do you know what's meant by market overview, Market overview is how the company has segmented the market and where they're going to send sales reps okay so part of part of part of responsible responsible use is targeting the right Physicians not targeting Physicians who have no reason, by their specialty or by with their practice to prescribe Excel go a sales rep can't be in that office because there's nothing good can come from that because they're not seeing chronic pain patients okay at least on the surface okay so it says Market overview prescribers and then targeting and scope introducing introducing dr. Marc Murphy then pharmacies chains Independence mail-order specialty and hospital so, so does that generally is that match with your understanding of what the market was for Mallinckrodt branded opioid product yes okay next page, I'm talks about Market overview here and volume segmentation did I read that correctly yes okay and then it talks about these different product families which I think you'd already discussed earlier so I won't spend a lot of time on that but suffice it to say you got oxycodone morphine fentanyl in alpana did I summarized that correctly Oxycontin yeah okay morphine products fentanyl products and oh panel okay and then it, facts about a prescriber audience greater than 325 thousand active prescribers do you know what that means that the the, potential number of prescribers who would be the called on audience could be as large as that, but and these are the metrics that we use to analyze that target market and to break that Target Market down into more sub-targets might say okay and when you say called on is that sometimes also referred to as being detailed it is okay and so then this breaks it down by various deciles and then it looks like there's 10 different death Styles is that your understanding that's 10 the cells are always intense okay, and so people that are a decile 10 for this prescriber those would be the highest prescribers right in the form okay okay next one, let's admit segmenting Physicians by-product use, identifying Physicians predisposed to prescribing one product one product written 50% of the time or more did I read that correctly you did okay and do you know what that means yes it was is trying to create an understanding of which of those Physicians were essentially using one product or were prescribing multiple products to their patient population okay and when you friends on their habits and their comfort level okay and so when you're talking about products, is that opioid products you're looking at every single prescription oh no these are just long-acting opioids just long-acting opioids long-acting long I think okay search the next one, segmentation survey, so looking at this one says among deciles 2:50 the spreader segment is the largest do you know what that means, the spreader segment was a, descriptor intended to identify that went with the segment that's spread their use across product types as you can see there as opposed to head dominant of one or the other okay I see so there's spreaders that use that will prescribe multiple opioids within their practice and then there's other folks that were called more dominant groups and they prefer one right okay and then so, that would make sense then for that second bullet which then says dominant groups oxycodone prescribers are the most loyal with an average share of 70% for Oxycontin in your understanding is that's accurate that's okay okay next page manually tuning the segmentation increases the overall coverage of the market without compromising the strategy do you have any understanding of what that, means, I just think it's saying that you have the raw data and then it's tweak somehow based on other criteria but I don't recall this at all okay and when they're talking about coverage of the market is it coverage of the market for sales, injection of porn coverage of the market in terms of the the intensity of prescribing which is very important to us okay and it's very important from a safety perspective total why okay so a high prescriber, has the potential to do more harm than a low prescriber okay so if I'm designing a safety program, I'm going to focus first step out the door I'm going to focus on the highest prescribers of example go because they have the potential to harm more patients than someone who writes one prescription and doesn't write another prescription for 6 months, it could take a lot of energy and time and money to get that position that's in West Bemidji Minnesota to fill out the eif and read the Rems and when we go there he says I I wrote One prescription for example oh I'm never write another I'd rather go to Freddy Smith over here in Indiana who writes 10 prescriptions a week and put my energy in on him in terms of Education okay so it's a it's reflects its real it's a reflex, based on what their prescribing activity is okay to make sense it does okay moving forward so then you have this next one which is this very colorful chart here and that's what that's talking about here right the various deciles of prescribers and what they tend to prescribe it is that right section of okay, okay and then switching to the next page self Salesforce sizing were you involved at all in determining the sizes of the sales yes okay did anybody ever consult with you about sizes of the sales for no okay Switching to the next one okay then it says profile of a Target introducing dr. Murphy do you know what a Target is in this context, sorry, so this this is a profile, of an hour prescriber within a luster t''v profile of a prescriber and what that prescribers prescription activity is okay and when it says that a Target does that mean a sales Target for exalted sales Target okay okay yes which would meet in and out I think you're on you're ahead of me I was on this one so I'll switch to this life okay same page now we're on the same page okay the top it says dr. Marc Murphy and then the prescriber any and a perfect, a number do you know what a prescriber and the is medical education number okay is that a license number it's a designation that Physicians have that can be tracked so it's a way to track them okay and then here it says Market decile 10 is that right that's right and that's the highest decile number for mail and crop rankings is that right that's right okay and so what does that mean he's he's in the top, he's in a group of Physicians who collectively prescribed, get this right, 10% of the highest prescribers in the top 10% of prescriptions so in other words there's some of their make up a number 5,000 prescriptions how many doctors is a-tickin generate 5,000 prescription will the top 10% it only takes 32 of them the next is style make take 50 in the next cycle 250 you know something dump the puck, Galatians get bigger in each decile as you go down okay so if I understand your testimony rate so this dr. Marc Murphy would be in the group of the highest prescribers of long-acting opioids the highest yes okay and so if I understood you correctly before that means he is at the highest possibility of doing the most harm reduction of one correct okay okay that's how I look at it the sales guys look at it is this is the, a place where we can get the most prescriptions because they already believe in long-acting opioids they have the patience for long-acting opioids I look at it the flip side I look at it you're right that's why I have to get this exact ago Rems information and the example goal cares Alliance information in there okay okay and then it says that this this Doctor's practice location is the north Alabama Pain Services and Decatur Alabama, do you know anything about the north Alabama Pain Services and Decatur Alabama election, hey switching to the next one is this what you were talking about for specialty makes a difference for you yes okay and so what is dr. Marc Murphy specialty according to this chart anesthesiology okay and it's anesthesiology and the type of practice you'd expect to see high prescribing of opioids if they practice pain management not only anesthesiologist practice pain management some practice in the hospital and they give anesthesia during surgery there they, would not be a Target but an anesthesiologist the other part of anesthesia is they become a pain specialist okay and treat patients with chronic pain okay, okay Switching to the next one and talks about pharmacies, do you know what this chart or what this what this slide represents here reaction, let me back up yeah do you know if Mallinckrodt was also looking at where a particular Physicians prescriptions were filled yes we making sales determinations yes okay and so in this case it looks like when profiling dr. Marc Murphy there's a discussion about chain pharmacies Independent Pharmacies mail order pharmacy is ETC is that right or drugs or deformed, I believe so I can't be sure whether it's Marc Murphy or whether it's pharmacies and chains in general I can't tell from this okay but to your understanding Mallinckrodt did track where it is that various positions, prescriptions for drugs all go were being filled right because if put yes they did okay and do you know why they track that information sure because if a physician in Decatur Alabama and there's let's say there's one main Pharmacy in Decatur Alabama writes a script for example go and the patient takes it to the Decatur Alabama Pharmacy and they don't have that exact logo that patient is extremely unhappy because remember that patients in pain right that patients going back to the doctor with a bit, complaint what about for the patients who actually aren't in pain that are just trying to get the drugs from the doctors objection if they can't get the drugs from the doctors and get a prescription from the doctors but they can't get the drugs from the doctor then they have to go to the pharmacy and get it filled that's where the PNP comes in it and that's for the PMP come here and they have to get it I'm behind okay she can't get the drugs from the doctor, they can get the drugs from the pharmacies with the prescription written by the doctors that correct that's correct okay our Focus was on proper prescribing that's the faucet goes open or closed okay,and if you switch to the one that says Ren's metrics and tracked data do you see that okay and it talks about enrollment do you know what they were talking about here with enrollment section of the form I believe it's enrollment in the Rems the exact algorithms so is that the filling out the sheet thing we talked about earlier is there anything more than the eif, there's more but it's so we what can we track we can track the eif because we have it you can track their prescription activity because we have it okay and then we justify those two against each other and if we have a prescriber that doesn't have any iif we sent people in there okay okay so then we'll just flip all the way here to the to the end says strategic approach Rems implementation and then there's this chart on the very, last page the chart, a colorful chart now we want to make sure did you create this trial God knows I wanted to just make sure that I understand it so this goes we have the physician to and then it says rxo the physician writes the prescription to the patient yes right okay and then the patient there's an arrow that goes to the pharmacy with RX so does that mean fills the prescription feels the prescription at the pharmacy and then there's, the arrow going the other way with the pills so the pharmaceutical back to the patient okay and then it has the manufacturer sends the pills to the pharmacy you see down the leaves out a step there because it goes to the wholesaler first but effectively it goes to the pharmacy okay and then, here between the pharmacy and the physician there's a thing called database what's the database do you know, the, database is a representation of all the data analytics that go on it's not a really a box Earth a single thing it's a global kind of thing okay and so it talks about eligibility of prescriber and patient you know what that is that's the eif on on on file for that prescriber okay and, and then going the other way from Pharmacy to database it says enroll Pharmacy do you know what that is, that I believe is a pharmacy that reports reports data not all pharmacies do but today nearly all do okay and then all the way at the bottom there's an arrow going from database to database to manufacturer and it says eligibility of Pharmacy do you know what that is, that's a way for us to check whether we're sending drug indirectly because we're sending it through a number of steps But ultimately its destination is an eligible Pharmacy a real Pharmacy illegitimate Pharmacy because you would want to make sure that your drugs aren't getting to illegitimate furnaces and you want to make sure that your opioids aren't getting two doctors who are prescribing them for inappropriate perfectly injection would want to make sure that, your opioids aren't getting to an illegal drug Market where they're being abused objection to form absolutely, do you know anything about dr. Marc Murphy no nothing do you know if dr. Marc Murphy still has a medical license now original idea I don't even know if he's a real doctor may have been made up just to illustrate a point I really don't know yeah, this is an educational settings may not have been real, so if Mark Murphy was real do you know if he ever filled out the REM survey you're asking me to speculate he just told you is never heard the name before, what would happen if you asked a physician to fill out the ram survey and they didn't, what would happen or could happen or yes variety of things okay, you know I can give you a spectrum of kind of responses that we got but that's just that's what you're looking for sure some would do it instantly yep some would want to understand why they're doing it some would say come back another day and I'll do it some would say I'm never going to do this, any others like that you know in that neighborhood so if someone was like I'm never going to do it or they came up with a million excuses to just never really turn it in with that information that you would collect oh absolutely and is that information that you would turn over to other folks at Mallinckrodt perhaps eventually but we would make multiple efforts to reason with the individual physician or to get his staff to help do it often works you have to be crafty, do you think it could be suspicious if a if a physician didn't want to get share that information injection of form it could be it could be the that the physician it's more than likely that the physician is suspicious about signing anything that goes to a pharmaceutical company couldn't it also be that the physician doesn't want to share information about their prescribing habits because perhaps they're not legitimate objection to form it could be but we have their prescribing habits, it's with or without the we don't need the I have to get them and they probably know that but it's amazing some don't okay during your time at Mallinckrodt did you ever identify any prescribers that you suspected were prescribing for illegitimate purposes, I didn't but we had multiple instances of such kind of activity that we you know flagged certain prescribers based on their prescription activity and sent in healthcare professionals to try to investigate not only other prescribing activity but adverse event occurrences where that the physician was the you know the physician relevant to the patient that had a severe adverse event okay and who would have been responsible for that amount, I cry for going into the doctor's office yes sir usually Eddie Darton who is a physician or one of our farm farm Dee's depending upon the severity and the location okay so I'm gonna kind of and shift just a little bit because I want to make sure that I understand it if I understood your testimony earlier you were talking about training of salespeople to detect signs of diversion did Ryan do I remember that correctly, no not to detect signs of diversion because they wouldn't really have that opportunity except if it's a pill Mill that we train them to detect pill Mills which something you can do visually from the parking lot who was responsible for that training a medical Affairs okay so that would have been in your purview, more more the healthcare professionals and I would would cooperate on it yeah okay and was there was there a program on training then there was a complete training program yes with videos and examples and pictures and things yeah okay so if I went to look in Mountain crowds documents I could find that somewhere like some packet do you know what it was called okay on and so it contains within that and the training of the salespeople, able to spot pill Mills will call it that if you're more comfortable with that do you know who specifically did the training on that I think we, I did a lot of the rep training on Remsen cares Alliance so it's more than likely I did some of it but there was follow-up from others in medical Affairs okay and do you know who created that program where it came from the training yes we did we did and do you know who Karen her fur is I know the name I don't know her personally okay did Harper did you, with anyone on on the generic side of Mallinckrodt and developing those signs to look for did not okay where did you get the information that you train folks on how to spot pill Mills just from data literature personal experience recommendations of experts it's compilation of things okay yeah and with those salespeople be trained just, when they started over there periodic training both okay it's heavy when they start and then there's follow-up training never stops in Pharmaceuticals because things change okay and what was your Salesforce instructed to do if they thought they had spotted signs that there was a pill Mill don't go in there don't have anything to do with them and report it to us okay and what types of things where they trained to look for reaction to form, doctor's office next door contig contiguously constructed with a pharmacy long lines of patients outside the door of the physician's office patients spending five minutes or less in the physician's office coming out and going next door to the pharmacy filling a prescription getting in a getting in their car driving away a large number of out-of-state license plates, I'm sorry I thought I turned it off, long lines of out of state, license plates on cars those types of things okay and so when you said they should report it who would they report it to generally to their management first that would get kicked up line and eventually would end up at us and medical medical Affairs okay and what what type of actions would begin at Medical Affairs of report, first is avoidance so that we wouldn't have anything to do with it make sure that we weren't selling product into those pharmacies we weren't interacting with those Physicians and I'm not sure how often it bubbled up to reporting them to the medical board but I know what other companies that I consulted with on this same kind of issue that had opioids we reported him to the medical board I can't remember that happened at kovarian or not okay and what about reports to the DA while you were a comedian do you know if those Sakura, if I don't I don't know okay and what about reports to Tennessee law enforcement do you know if that occurred I do not know okay do you recall any events of anybody reporting suspected pill Mills or signs of diversion in Tennessee during your time I do not, did a Mallinckrodt have a do not call list, do you know of any Physicians from Tennessee Ron that list I do not know that do you know how many Physicians approximately run that list, without being named specifically there was a huge do not call segment of the prescribing potential prescribing population because they didn't meet the standards that we set for their specialty or their patient population so there was no justification for having a sales rep in there okay so mostly you you folks spent your time on the Physicians that were, describing the highest level of long acid acting opioids objection of form and not just that and had the right training so you're starting out with a select group that's kind of automatic risk mitigation because these are pain experts as opposed to some doctor who hasn't had the training who is just a high prescriber that's a danger that's a danger sign so, hi prescribers of long-acting opioids who had a specialty like pain management anesthesia pain management Etc yeah okay and that's where most of the focus was for sale right okay, okay I think I understand it now I've just got a little bit more for you maybe either he's going to run out, for this though I don't think it'll work you think so okay maybe we'll see okay give me one second okay well Mark this next one is plaintiffs exhibit 26 26 26,I only have just a couple questions okay so it might be easier if I just ask you the questions first we'll get you out of here a little faster okay on for the record exhibit 26 is Bates number and then K hype and T1 underscore 000 631 4936 with the, judgment that is for 937 okay Phil take a look at the first page which is the email for me sir yes I have okay and this appears to be an email that is that from Preston Walker and to a bunch of folks and then copy is Bobby Clarke in you is that correct that's correct okay and it's dated to 14 2011 is that correct that's correct okay and do you have any reason to do believe that you receive this email and the regular course of your, - I do okay so it says here PPS and I think you said what that meant earlier patient product safety okay Bobby and I were asked to put together a training module for the upcoming Advance sales training please review the attached presentation and return comments to me by Co be on Tuesday to 1511 thanks Preston did I read that correctly you did okay now let's just flip through this, on thing here, okay if you look at on slide number 9 its page number 9,did you create this document sir I did not I reviewed it participate in creating a but I didn't actually physically create it okay if you will read for me what it says on, slide 9 here federal law enforcement authorities in November 9 2009 dismantle the Florida drug trafficking ring that had sent more than 190,000 oxycodone tablets from South Florida pain clinics to abusers in Kentucky North Carolina Tennessee Virginia and West Virginia at least 20 people were indicted on distribution charges the ring had allegedly operated for three years and used at least four or five Clinic doctors per day per day to obtain the drugs members of the Ring ship thousands of, pills every day by vehicle or overnight delivery services and allegedly made at least five million dollars over three years okay and the citation for that is the National Drug Treatment assessment to present ten is that correct that's correct do you know who the National Drug Treatment assessment is it's what it is, not exactly but it's a national kind of initiative to address this problem okay consider it to be a reliable source I don't know I can't comment on that but I'm assuming it would be okay do you have any reason to doubt what you just read oh no no I have no reason to doubt okay so in this case the information that you just read talks about federal law enforcement arresting people for engaging in a conspiracy to sell 190,000 oxycodone tablets, tablets is that correct that's correct perform okay and it says that those were coming from south Florida pain clinics to abusers and Kentucky North Carolina and Tennessee is that right that's correct and and Virginia and West Virginia just to be complete yep it does that indicate to you that oxycodone tablets for going from South Florida playing clinics into the illegal drug Market in Tennessee absolutely okay and it says at least 20 people were indicted the ring operative, years and used at least four or five pink Hunter Clinic doctors per day to obtain the drugs is that right yes ok and when it was talking before it was talking about pain clinics is that right yes okay so in this situation you had people doctors who were pain management doctors at pain clinics is that right direction of one but it is I understand it these were this is this is basically the pill Mill practice okay so I guess my question is if you're talking, talking about targeting folks or sales that are high prescribers of long-acting opioids who are also in an appropriate and appropriate Specialties like pain management that could be a pill Mill they could be operating a pill Mill or it could be legitimate is that right absolutely okay and when you're targeting them do you know if they're a pill Mill or a legitimate operation not not initially we need to do more due diligence, a chance to find that out to verify that where they're going is legitimate and the reps are trained for telltale signs that as I talked about before okay and what would happen if a rep saw those signs and didn't report it objection to form and didn't report it, and then it was discovered later is that what you mean they'd be in a lot of trouble, okay you can set this one aside, I think I'm going to be pretty quick so unless you want to switch but I think that might be, cat looking through my Roundup okay I've got one more one more real quick and if it looks like you need to stop just let me know okay okay, okay number 27 it's actually 27 and 28 so let's mark them at the same time if that's okay because they kind of go together, and we'll just do 27 first, that's okay, yeah but we've marked as exhibit 27 which is an email on Bates number mnk hyphen T1 underscore 00 07 09 4004 and it is a three page email, a three-page email chain sir is this an email that was sent to you from Kevin Lena Berg on June 8 2011 yes okay and did you receive this email in the ordinary course of your business assume I did yes okay and so I questioned about this is actually pretty pretty easy on if you'll just set this down for a second and then we can talk about it in a minute I'm do you know the, book called defeat chronic pain now I do have you read the book I've read parts of it I've perused it I haven't read it word for word okay and did the cares Alliance provide copies of defeat defeat chronic pain now to prescribing Physicians we did amongst other books yes okay what other books did you prescribe did you provide doctor Fisherman's book on risk management, mint I think those are the two main ones that we did okay and other than prescribing Physicians to defeat chronic pain now go to other folks as well defeat chronic pain now was a book that we gave to Physicians to give to their patients okay on and I should have asked you before this is just an aside and I'm sorry to kind of go off a little bit on but when we were talking about detailing of Physicians did to your knowledge did Mallinckrodt sales folks also detail pharmacies, I don't know really did you ever hear about on perhaps Mallinckrodt detailing pharmacies to make sure that they had exalt go on their shelves in case of physician wrote the prescription I believe that I believe that happened okay initially that's kind of up front at the launch but once it's done it's you have to go back anymore okay and did you have responsibility for training sales folks to detail pharmacies I did not know okay do you know who would have sales training department, ain't okay okay so we don't need to look at this email if you know that you already provided defeat chronic pain now okay on looking at defeat chronic pain now, it, have you gone back and read defeat chronic pain now since you left Mallinckrodt subjection of home okay do you know if any of the claims and defeat chronic pain now have been disproven I do not know that okay on they talk about pseudo addiction and defeat chronic pain now do you recall that I do recall that yeah because pseudo addictions and issue okay and what do you mean it's an issue I mean it's a concern that people have how to deal with patients that are presenting with sudo addiction, do you believe pseudo addiction to be a legitimate scientific I'm not the one to judge that but enough Physicians tell me it's an issue or told me at the time I don't talk about it now but told me at the time it's something they have to deal with do you know if that's true I don't know if it's true okay do you know of pseudo addiction actually exists okay did the FDA approved the label for eggs that did the FDA approved label for example go mention anything about, do addiction to your knowledge my not my belief is they did not okay, okay and do you know if defeat chronic pain now is available online I don't know, I don't think I have any more questions thank you very much sir,we're back on the record the time is 7:02 p.m. Miss Rowley thank you for your time so far I just have a couple of questions for you what was your role on the suspicious order monitoring team my role was to inform them of what the patient and product safety team was doing in terms of the Rems Exile Go Rims and the cares Alliance to make them aware of what we were doing did you have any involvement with suspicious order monitoring, I of generic opioids I did not did you have any knowledge or understanding of how the suspicious order monitoring program for generic opioids worked at Mallinckrodt not really what was the goal of the sales force at Mallinckrodt to to visit with prescribing physicians in their target audience and inform them of the risks and benefits of their promoted products during your time at Mallinckrodt did you have any role, in chargebacks I did not and do you have any understanding of how chargebacks work at Mallinckrodt I do not thanks Ted, you just were asked question about the sales forces task at Mallinckrodt you recall that just now yeah and that they were to mix with doctors and give them risks and benefits correct correct did you have any role in following up to see if the Salesforce stuck to that assigned tasks or expanded their, discussions with doctors know but others did, who the sales organization the legal department medical Affairs other than me and Cetera, okay nothing perfect okay

gghb0039,"now what was the cost of all this this chart shows the combined earnings for Philip Morris r.j. Reynolds and American Tobacco in those those are the three companies that we that we have easiest access to their domestic tobacco earnings number and what you can see is from 1990 on through 92 for those three companies which are more, or less representative of in a train sense of what the what the industry profitability would look like this are steadily increasing earnings in early 1993 that began to decline partly as a result of some of those prior earnings having been inflated particularly for Philip Morris by trade loading and their volume was beginning to fall off pretty sharply in early 1993 same was true for, our American but once the promotional activity began to take place very precipitous decline on through the third quarter where the rate of earnings was literally less than half of what it was last year and the fourth quarter folks is going to be even worse so the cost to, Industry profitability of these pricing moves has been has been enormous Philip Morris just yesterday announced a revision to its to its full-year forecast as you know they said that they would be down 40% up to 40% in domestic tobacco for the year 1993 every way that we cut the numbers suggested it was more like 40, 85% and we couldn't figure out how they could get to 40 Without Really ramping up the loading again and we thought that really is crazy so so rich and Roger you were absolutely right they have now revised their earnings forecast to precisely meet yours and so they will be down, in earnings this year percentage-wise more than more than we will, all right let's look at our results first nine months it's not a particularly representative number because we've got one full quarter at the old prices and then parcel prices and so forth so this is where we were a year to date volume down 1.8% for the nine month period and here's what we're expecting for the full year that overall our shipment volume will be done 4.3%, went with some erosion of that very high level share level we had in savings and we'll talk more about that later and why that is actually in our view somewhat of a of a positive because of the waste and friends are playing at net sales reflective of part-year price reduction off 21 percent or about one point one or two billion dollars and, a 900 million dollar decline in business unit contribution 42 .5 percent versus revised number now for 45% for Philip Morris and probably greater declines for the for the smaller companies so, if you look at what the implications of this are for the competitive Outlook because the smaller players got hurt so badly during the price War both in full price and in savings savings the smaller players We Believe must do some discounting and promotion and get some price edges in order to stabilize their businesses, that they really almost have no other choice but to do that, here we have our Jr in the mix wanting to deescalate this price War wanting to to keep the Gap from opening back up again wanting to keep Philip Morris from bringing the hammer down again and doing something crazy and Philip Morris, I Believe by this time has learned that their strategy will not work how do I know that one they just revised their earnings down yesterday, now our responses to this, we have, almost immediately after April 2nd began to work on how this might play out and to look at some areas where the where the price decrease would become permanent and we pretty much concluded that it would become permanent the amount of the decrease in the timing of the decrease were unclear but we knew directionally that was going to happen there's been a huge amount of very successful work throughout the company in identifying savings, during the second part of 1993 a lot of non critical discretionary spending with stopped immediately as you know we've gone through a painful and difficult effort which resulted in staff reduction RJ are also led the effort for Price Point consolidation when we when we followed Philip Morris down on the, so price price reduction we did something a little different consolidating our 85s price up to the hundreds price point that was I think 30 cents a carton the annualized benefit from having done that has over 70 million dollars through despite all this turmoil in the marketplace, we were able to very successfully launched two new full price brand Styles camel special lights and select lights with those introductions have been even better if if we weren't in the midst of all the turmoil sure they would I think so but nevertheless successful introductions for both brand Styles we very quickly reduced are discounting and promotion, we have also very clearly improved our marketing cost Effectiveness we've also learned how to how to better leverage some of our high paid back marketing programs camel cash would probably be an example you're all familiar with that has proven itself cost effective because it brings in and retains competitive smokers, given everything I've said about about the environment in 94, we have to have a set of key assumptions on which we build the plan and here's what we look like they look like we have assumed that there will be some amount of unfavorable legislation in 1994 our objective is and continues to be to defeat any, Federal excise tax, to postpone if there is one any federal excise tax but if we had built a plan for 1994 and assumed that nothing was going to go wrong in terms of federal excise taxes and state excise taxes you probably would sort of tuned out on me right about that so all that was meant to do was to to assume something where it looks today is it looks like, we might even get all the way through 1994 before any federal excise tax becomes an issue we've also integrated the cost of imported Leaf restrictions, we've assumed that there is a moderation of the competitive environment we made what appears to be an excellent deception that there would be a small full price price increase, but the part we don't know about yet is lower full price discounting and foremost what we have seen since the price increases took effect a pretty dramatic reduction in discounting in full price if you go back to pre Marlboro Friday anywhere from the third to a half of all full price product was being promoted to one degree or another today that number is down to more like 10% and, I would expect it to stay there or even decline further last assumption and the Assumption here I think is absolutely correct the question is to what degree is it correct, what are our key objectives after my car purrs presentation you probably could have guessed this but but very important this is the right strategy for RJ Reynolds tobacco it's got nothing to do with Mike Harper Steve Wilson or anybody else this industry has lost its credibility, with the financial Community this company I believe is on the verge of losing its credibility with the financial Community we are now five years into the lbo, and we have not demonstrated continued progress on our surprise the way we gain credibility with Cheryl is going forward is earnings simple as that the kinds of objectives we have set for 1994 which I believe are achievable, will truly impress the financial community, because I think their expectations for Progress can be exceeded by the results that we can post in 1994 and there is nothing better than beating expectations, what is that go, get our business unit contribution up by 15% in 1994 and that will yield a number of 1.4 billion dollars in business unit contribution how do you do that,critically important for us to focus our energy on what can pay off for us as a company as I said before I think we have better knowledge than any other company in this industry on what will work for us in the marketplace what will generate positive returns promotionally, this issue of market share versus earnings all of our instincts all of our competitive instincts all of our historical instincts drive us towards Sharon wouldn't we all like to be the number one company again if we had a goal of being the number one company in this industry if that's what I put up on this chart, so you're serious man because that will blow up this industry that will blow up this industry anybody who single-mindedly focuses on market share growth in the 1990s in this industry is going to lose, third point we're not going at looking to give up market share we're not going on same here you guys take a little bit here you guys take a little bit but the problem we've had is as we respond to the little competitors in the business is that we, when we're responding to American Tobacco with it within a chair and we come in and match one of their activities it's the it's the 500-pound gorilla coming in when Philip Morris comes in its the 800-pound gorilla and that and the problem is when we respond across the board to those kinds of competitive actions we pull the whole Market down so we have to be, willing, to slowly count to three before we respond we have to find ways to respond more tactically, when we need to match a competitor do it by Outlet do it by local market instead of these across-the-board kind of responses so that says that suggest there is a risk to our volume and market share and we built that into our assumptions for 94 and it says very importantly we have to choose our battles carefully, well here's how much it costs have to go down in 1994, we are reducing our total cost base from 93 to 94 by little over 25%, Far and Away the bulk of that money is is in full price and savings marketing, a major component of that reduction has to do with the elimination of price discounting that is no longer required because we've taken it in terms of a net price reduction the best thing that's happened to Winston-Salem Fantage more and now is that their net price at retail is more competitive than it was before and so far on those Brands versus what we calculated, dated would be the impact the volumes are in fact running running better than we had had forecasted they would be well what does all this mean in terms of all the things we've been talking about for the last couple of years and wanting to be the best company in the business and I want to assure you there is no change in in our Jr.'s commitment to building long-term strength stability and profitability but in this new, fireman tie think being the best means being as profitable as we can, running our business at the least possible cost while remaining competitive doing all the right things that we need to do for this business and producing over the course of the next few years a superior profit Trend than any of our competitors it also means a continuous process not of taking this cost base, Dan 25% and then going to sleep at the switch but to continue to challenge the way we do things so that we can get ahead of our competitors on a cost base this is not an event or series of events it's a continuing management challenge for this entire group and product Innovation is another lever we have in your Marketplace because there are still plenty of, consumer, wants in cigarette products that aren't being met today and those companies which can best meet those needs are going to be much less susceptible to price Wars and couponing and all that sort of thing, I think it requires some new behavior on everybody's part we have to be more focused, we have to if you look at at some of our history we've sometimes kind of run from well analyze the heck out everything or we will just kind of say hey we all know this business and let's go and let's move quick and where we need a balance of analysis with judgment Jim steyer always talks with his folks about being 80% research safe, and what that means is you get enough analysis to be done to know that directionally you're moving correctly but you don't wait around for all the information to come in because it's probably going to be too late to move that balance and what we're all paid for is managers is that kind of balance of to know when we've got sufficient analysis and when we apply judgment and appropriate level of, risk and get it done in the marketplace it also means refocusing our time as managers and our people's time on, putting on the side those things that are it's this as an important you know hopefully we're not doing anything it's unimportant but those things that are clearly less important don't get in our way day-to-day and when you come in at 8:00 and then started consumes your day that you take charge and make sure we address those things that are important to achieving the objectives we're talking about finally I think it involves a continuation, Ian of the kind of approaches we've been talking about for a while which is managing Our People based on influence versus rigid control, in this new culture we have to constantly rethink our business we have to communicate our goals and progress that's what this meeting is all about that's what the meanings that that you need to hold with your folks are all about to say here's where we're trying to get into post people along the way of how we're getting there, everybody in this company needs to have a single-minded focus in 1994 on earnings, we have to continue to work to empower our employees and we have to continue our emphasis on teamwork and why is some of this important because we're going through real trauma in the company and many of the people in this room have had to deal with the sort of gut-wrenching issues of reducing headcount and whether a department was, acted or not it's had an impact throughout this company and here's start of a list of the typical kind of shock waves that come about after a restructuring of a company is a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity why are we doing this where are we going there's indecision there there usually is a fall-off in productivity as mistrust of company and management there's a loss of team spirit you got power struggles, as people try to figure out how do they gain Advantage politically in a new environment you clearly often get week commitment, and you get everybody hunkering down to try to avoid any risk, well those are the kinds of things that can prevent us from achieving the objectives we we talked about we need to, focus on getting on with our business and that means explaining to our people what our situation is as a company and if anybody in clear on that I want to make sure you are before you leave the room today, we have to, change the way we do business for all the reasons you've seen so far this morning do not dwell on the past, we've got to get on with this business we don't have time, and it ain't got to be productive for anybody to spend a lot of time chewing on that we've got to get focused on, moving the business forward and as Mike Harper said so well this morning you have to keep a sense of humor you have to keep the sensor you, we've got to work more than ever to build our people to empower them to continue training them we want to in a very personal way as well as institutionally facilitate the issues our employees have to deal with both you know we tend to think about the ones who are who are leaving and I think we do a great job as a company of supporting people's transition out of the, a company but we also need to focus on those folks who stay and what are their needs in this in this transition finally we have to we have to do everything we can to continue to communicate very clearly very frequently with our with it with all our people and so over and over again we need to talk to people about what we're trying to accomplish, I think there are a couple of real keys to motor motivating are people in this in this new environment, I don't know anybody that can understand a single-minded focus on earnings there is no ambiguity there is no ambiguity about results, we are gonna reward process we're gonna reward results, I'm going to need the very best from you and your people in every function of this company we have to continue to work to eliminate unnecessary costs to improve our margins are earnings and our future outlook, we have to continually look for new definitions of least possible cost, very importantly make sure your people understand that we are not cutting our costs to shrink this company, we are cutting costs to grow the company and that's an incredibly, important mindset that everybody has to have we're here to build a stronger business not not to milk it and we have to have a sense of commitment to that and urgency when we go about it you've seen that the negative impact that price reductions and earnings price reductions and earnings declines have had on a stock price but with signs already that we intend to respond aggressively and improve our earnings our stock is clearly started to, cover whether it continues to improve will depend on whether we actually deliver better results and delivering results means achieving our earnings goal in the 1990s in this industry winning means earnings, no question it will be a challenge it's a new environment and that means we've got to continue to look for new ways to win for a long time we've said and rightly so that RJ our people have a passion for winning we're being put to the test, but I think it gives us a chance to show what were made of I don't think we're the kind of people who back off from a challenge please accept this Challenge and prove once again that we are Builders of the future not by standards, the only thought I want to leave you with is let's go make some money, 1.4 billion has a nice room to me then let's have some fun doing it and let's be sure to communicate what we heard today well I'm very happy to be here today and to have this opportunity to talk about our gr tobacco International I'm very excited about working for a company as vital and dynamic as t.i. I've been made most welcome here Southern Hospitality at its best and I appreciate it, this meeting is timely in many respects the tobacco industry worldwide is in a period of Rapid change with economic social and government factors all playing a key role in shaping Marketplace Dynamics and closer to home for we at TI undertaking changes within the overall organization changes that I believe will strengthen the international company by making a sharper more efficient and better able to meet the challenges ahead, our principal objective over the last five years has been to strategically position the company for long-term growth while at the same time delivering strong earnings and cash flow growth and t i succeeded on both counts volume during this five-year period grew at a compounded annual rate of 11% earnings have compounded at a strong 23 percent per year, operating profit margin has improved more than five percentage points and cash flow has grown at a compounded rate of 20% while we continue to invest in upgrading and expanding the capacity of our production facilities, this ongoing success is driven by three key strategies that keep our sights fixed squarely uncontrolled high-quality earnings growth these strategies have proven sound in the past and will continue to work well for us this year and beyond for us to continue this momentum however we're going to have to think quicker act faster and be more entrepreneurial than our competitors we cannot rest on our Laurels and expect to remain competitive we can, never be satisfied, looking to the future I believe the prospects for our business continue to be excellent we're a growth company and a growing International industry a performance in recent years backs that up and I believe that strong growth will characterize a performance in the years ahead, ah Jia tobacco International will probably not be the biggest company in the industry not in the near term anyway but it will be known as the premier company throughout the industry it will be recognized as a leader in terms of strong growth earnings delivery and shareholder value it will be a leader in customer service and it will continue to be an exciting Dynamic and rewarding place to work, and when Jim and I are talking to the banks of the security analysts they do not diss they are not willing to take whatever you say at face value I mean you guys could you can't just get up there and make these wild claims about what you're going to achieve you got to have facts you got to have data you got to you got to really support your story and in the food business when we're pitching our sales growth story we build on two platforms the first is we try to convince them that we're a company, open with a lot of marketplace power and then the second thing we try to do is convince them that we got Superior marketing and the theory is that if I can make these Bankers these analysts believe that we're strong in the marketplace and if I can convince them that we got good marketing programs that maybe they will accept a story that we will be able to grow our sales, the first thing I point out to them is that in terms of sales were the fourth largest food company in North America only kgf ConAgra and S are larger I then go on to make the point that we've got 17 brands in the u.s. each with annual sales of over 100 million dollars a hundred million in the food business 100 Millions the level you got to get to to be what we call a power brand and power brands are vital to growth and 17 happens to be, a lot a lot bigger number than the power brands of our closest competitors and again this is relevant because every Power brand you have gives you an opportunity to do line extensions and French enfranchise extensions that you have more power Brands than the other guys gives you more platforms to build from, thankfully I usually focus on is are 12 core businesses these are these are 12 are 12 businesses that make up 90% plus of ourselves and the key point that I go on to make is that for seven of these twelve businesses were the market leader that those seven businesses do about 78 percent of our sales and then of the remaining four in a couple were a strong number two and I'm going to pause here because this is important in today's world there's absolutely nothing wrong with being a strong number, now that's what General Mills is and cereal that's what Pepsi is and soft drinks and candidly that's what you are in tobacco a strong number two position is still a position that you can you can do very very well in the marketplace what you don't want to be today is a week number two which you are not in our business I'm lucky I got a week number two Keebler is a week number two you'll see some stats on that in a minute but the Pepsi is in the General Mills and the RJ r--'s can all do very very, very well working from from a solid base a point I try to hit really hard with the analysts is that for those businesses what we are number one we really dominate the category let me explain how this slide works if you take that cookie category on the top we're number one and cookies of course we've got a 39 percent market share and that is three times larger than the share the number two competitor which of course is keeper so you know with three times larger than the number two guy I won't dwell on it but if you just run your eye, I down that dominance Factor call them you'll see that even in our weakest didn't number two number one positions were still almost double the size of the nearest guy in the game in fact in the seven categories where we're number one the average share of Our Brands is an impressive 45% and even those are these are very high shares obviously but they're still growing, today this year Brands representing almost 90 percent of our sales of actually increased their market share another statistic that it illustrates our dominance of the cookie I'm breaking it into pieces now cooking and cracker markets is that in both cookies and in crackers we got the trailer we were here and we are both cookies and crackers we've got the top four brands in each of those categories, The Descent the beginning the second platform that I try to build our sales growth story on is superior marketing and they're basically two thrusts that decision that claimed the first Jim mentioned thank you is new products and the second is our advertising that drives the sales of those products, new products new products are particularly important because everyone has come to realize in the US food industry if you're not successful new products you just not going to win the game and it's an area where our track record is very good I I close I close my remarks usually about new products with an important statistic which is that if you take products that have been introduced over the last 24 months on a rolling basis they'll do about 165 million dollars worth of business for us this year, again if you want to put 865 in a context for us 165 million is larger than sunshine sunshine being the number three company in the cookie and cracker business they turn 65 million dollars is larger than the sun shines total business so we're just new products along we have equal the number three competitor but of creating serious there aren't many opportunities for synergies that's a sad fact of life but again I'm not one to hide from realities but just because there aren't sort of tangible synergies in the marketplace doesn't mean that the, can't be what I consider to be sort of emotional support in both directions and I really do work very hard my side of the company to make sure that there is emotional support for everything you people are doing down here this is very important to us in the end my people with large shareholdings are very depend on how well you do and so I'll close with the thought that I think we've had an emotionally supportive relationship to date and I hope very much that that spirit continues thank you it's been fun to be with you today",0.8582370702803739,0.6964612,0.9128387,gghb0039,,tobacco; cigarette;<a

ggxh0257,"back on the record at 4:33 p.m., hey mister is vorta stassi's you say it yes okay you don't say Strasse in the German Way I don't know do other people say it that way sometimes okay my name is Tricia herzfeld and I am one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs and the Tennessee State litigation before we get started today I just want to put a couple of objections on the record I'm number one I think my objection to my time today being counted against the mdl has already been stated but I want to be very clear that we have, given plenty of sufficient notice to Mallinckrodt about Our intention to participate today in which we were invited by Mallinckrodt to participate here and it wasn't until 2:00 p.m. when the deposition was already well underway that Mallinckrodt is for the very first time raising this issue of having to share time with the mdl to which we of course subject secondarily as has been our ongoing objection to the depositions that we've been crossed noticed two in this case, believe that Mallinckrodt has not appropriately followed the guidelines set down by the mdl court for the cross noticing of us and these depositions for the providing of documents and ensuring that we have sufficient information to go forward to question these Witnesses about Tennessee issues for depositions where we have been cross noticed I'm sure Council will want to say something back because he always does but, those are objections just for the record we disagree with these characterizations and I've only heard earlier today that state Council stated that she had not reviewed the mdl order and is in fact is intending to take a second 30 B 6 deposition of the company which violates the the principle underlying the Court's orders and with that we reserve overwrites accordingly and I just want to be very clear I didn't say I had reviewed the mdl, order I said I wasn't subject to the 14 hours our state case is not part of the mdl run our own jurisdiction as you are aware we will deal with that in the state court issue but we fully intend to take our own 30 B 6 just to be clear, I concur in Trisha's General objection that anytime she takes today should not be counted against the 14 hours that we have been provided for pursuant to the clear terms of the mdl and as noted by Trisha we were not given notice until 2:00 today that Mal crowd was taking this position, okay moving on I think we all have flights to make mr. Borges Strasse did you do anything specifically to prepare for questions about Tennessee for your deposition today no I did not in Kate did you discuss with anybody any particular issues about male and crowds business in Tennessee in preparation for your deposition today I discussed with my attorneys as part of preparation the general concept of the issue relative to Tennessee, you okay and so you have been prepared to answer questions about Tennessee for your testimony today, I have been generally prepared to answer some questions about Tennessee okay and what is your understanding of the state litigation in Tennessee, very minimal I know that it has something to do with drug trafficking laws and that's about the extent of it okay and do you have any idea who the plaintiffs are in the case not specifically no what about generally I don't know whether it's the state itself or if there are others okay and what about drug trafficking laws do you understand the lawsuit to be about the eye, really don't just know that it's that's generally what it's related to okay and other than your attorneys did you speak with anybody else about any drug trafficking issues as you said or mail and Kratts businesses in Tennessee before your deposition today no okay did you review the complaint or any other documents from the Tennessee litigation before testifying today no have you seen any portion of it, no okay has anybody summarized it for you know okay, okay I'm, earlier today you were talking about procedures related to compensation it's topic 10 which have been identified for folks that had oversight or control over Marketing sales distribution of prescription opioids for the cake the case track 1 jurisdictions do you remember that General testimony from this morning yes okay and does that compensation scheme is that different at all for Tennessee, the compensation practices excuse me that we used for our branded sales representatives were individualized the territories were individualized based upon sales representative but the overall Compensation Plan and the way it was built was consistent throughout the country okay in what sales region was Tennessee, I don't know specifically how that region was designated okay do you know anything about it changing over time I don't know specifics about a changing over time I'm aware that the sales territories were re-evaluated on a periodic annual basis have you ever heard somebody refer to a sales territory called the Nashville district, no I don't think so okay who is responsible for dividing up the various districts the sales districting plan was assembled analyzed by the commercial analytics team and was subsequently approved by Sales Management okay and I'm going to hand you what we're going to Mark as exhibit one a 17,take a look at nothing tired I can't let Sara take your time, okay okay so I have a just a couple questions I want to make sure I understand how you guys break things down so within mail and crowd and your Salesforce you have what is it regions and then districts and then territories all kind of getting smaller as they go along is that right yes that's generally correct okay and so when you look at the second slide here and what it is I've shown you which appears to be the Salesforce alignment and placement for mnk 795 launch, snap reports for North Central region deeded October 24 2013 did I read that correctly yes you did okay what is mnk 795 M NK 7 95 was the research program identifier for the product which became zart M SX R upon approval okay, and was the map reports for the for the various sales forces were those different for how do you say it 02 - is Artemis or 10 minutes then they were from Alan Kratz other branded products or were they generally the same so I can't say for sure how these differ from past district and territory alignments but we re-evaluated, added the entire sales plan for the launch of Tsar Thomas and as a result of that we drew specific territories based upon our analysis of prescribers okay were you personally involved in that and that process I was not okay and which team would have been involved in that this was formerly known as the global business insights and forecasting team also referred to as commercial analytics which was a part of, branded business group at that time okay and what's it called now that group no longer so that's one that no longer exist okay okay and so at least in 2013 these were the Region's the districts and the territories for at least a certain section of the country that's what we're looking at here right yes that's correct okay and so do you see if it says region north central and the second slide on the first page yes do you see the state of Tennessee included in that I do so would it appear from this document then that the state of Tennessee was included, in the north central region yes I agree okay now if you'll flip to the second page with me and I actually I should clarify yes sir it looks like most of Tennessee is in North Central region I don't know if the rest of Tennessee was included elsewhere well there's actually a very very astute point it looks like Memphis is not so that's a that's a very good point and I take it flipping to the second page it says District Nashville Tennessee do you see where I'm looking at mhm the very first time the very first light and so going from, you probably don't know where Jackson Tennessee is due, it's not on the mound submit to you the Jacksons about halfway between Nashville and Memphis so I'm going to kind of draw this line where that end of the blue is there and call it Jackson it's going from most of Tennessee over to the east does it look like most of Tennessee there is included within the district called Nashville Tennessee yes it appears so okay and then the various territories are included within that if you keep flipping with me you've got a couple territories there in North Carolina if you flip to the next page which is Page 4 of this exhibit there is also, a territory for Knoxville Tennessee territory for Nashville Tennessee territory for Chattanooga Tennessee territory for Johnson City Tennessee keep flipping and then you've got North and South Nashville Tennessee do you see all those yes I do okay and those are all designated a separate territories within the Nashville district is that correct yes that's correct okay and did you have anything to do with those designations no I did not okay and how many sales people would cover each territory, it's my understanding that each territory would have one sales represent okay and would they sometimes have more than one territory or did you generally do one pretory my general understanding is it's one per territory okay, and did you have anything to do with receiving information from those sales people from those territories with in Tennessee no I did not personally okay did you ever see people who did no I did not okay so do you have any information about any sales information that would have been coming from the various territories in Tennessee making its way up through the upper echelon of Mallinckrodt I do not have any of that information now that you know who would so that, would be contained in our financial records okay, in terms of individuals who might have that information I'm not sure any individuals who would still be with the company who would have that information can you think of any names of people who are no longer with the company who might have that information, trying to think if this is the time period when Ron Wood Klein was in charge of the sales team okay can you think of anybody else,this Hugh O'Neill was the president Pharmaceuticals at the time, anybody else, that specific names no okay, have you ever been to Tennessee I have been fencing yes querida Nashville Memphis Chattanooga okay and you just come as a visitor do you own property don't just a presenter and when's the last time you've been to Tennessee, I guess October, October this year yes okay where'd you go I drove through, okay, have you ever been to Upper East Tennessee Appalachian region I've driven through that area okay what years section 2 scope, you can answer,I guess was probably 95 or 96 okay, you ever been to Tennessee for work yes okay and when would that have been, approximately three three or four years ago to the Memphis area, okay was that the only time for work that you've come to Tennessee, thank I attended a conference there back in the 90s okay other than the conference and the time to going to Memphis those are the only two times okay and what brought you to Memphis three or four years ago for work objection to scope what topic does this relate to what 30 B 6 topic does this relate to you can answer the question, I came to Memphis to visit to customers of the generics business at that time okay, and who are the two customers McKesson was one and Excel RX, they were a hospice provider, okay, and what brought you to visit those two customers in Memphis just a general business discussion and just a relationship meeting okay who asked for the meeting them are you okay just scope, I don't recall okay and we're either of those customers folks that distributed now in Kratts opioid products, McKesson distributed are opioid products and accelerates purchased our opioid products for dispensing to their Pharmacy patients okay and we're now in crowds opioid products discussed at all during those two meetings Disco, I believe so okay what was the content of those discussions just go I don't recall the content, are you selling and those were not sales calls okay those were general relationship calls where we visited their facilities to see their operation and I'm sure in the course of that visit we saw our product in their distribution centers and discuss General comments about how our products were were either used or transported, okay Amber there it was there any discussion about diversion of Mount crowd opioids at either of those meetings objective scope diversion is outside the scope of the designated topics for this Witness, I don't recall any such discussions okay what about the abuse of Malachi opioids are opioids in general in those meetings, I don't recall anything like that is there anything else about the discussions that you do recall Chek just go not a proper 30 B 6 topic, okay answer, no I don't remember any other specifics okay and would there been paperwork associated with those meetings it's a report or email or something you write on the way back, something was probably generated not necessarily by myself there's an over there okay and if I were looking for those where would I look just go emails emails okay and you probably would have been copied on them I'd be my guest okay just go that's possible, okay so they weren't sales calls you didn't talk about diversion you didn't talk about abuse of opioids, talk about charge bags just go six question now for my recollection we talked with McKesson about their General operation about any, like any feedback that we had for them about the ordering process any feedback they had for us about how product was packaged or or shipped the visit with Excel or X was relative to seeing their operation talking to them in general about their business and goals for the future no specific, Asians were made that I can recall okay, okay anyways we talked before you said generally there were some differences based on individual sales people and paraphrasing you so tell me if I'm wrong here on their compensation but the general compensation scheme was somewhat uniform is that right so 24 so the Compensation Program was developed and a consistent manner the incentive Compensation Plan was was set up consistently across territory, he's the individual territory targets were set on the territory by territory basis and so the goals that sales representatives were measured against were territory specific the way they are compensated on those goals was consistent okay and do you know anything about the Nashville district and they are their goals being different you know any of the specifics on that I do not okay, okay and then earlier you talked about 850 twos or 867 sales plans do you remember those conversations we discussed a 52 and 867 data data okay did you have any companies that had 52 or 867 arrangements with Mallinckrodt in Tennessee, I am not aware if we had any customers in Tennessee who had those arrangements K where could I look to find that information, the the information about which customers provided us with those data feeds would be contained within the the distribution agreements with those customers okay and how can I find out which distribution agreements were in Tennessee with you all I'm assuming there's a bazillion of them so are they sorted in a way or the end of database how do they know within like a state territory, well so the distribution agreements weren't set up on a state territory basis and those agreements were all national level agreements okay so you would have to know who the entities are with in Tennessee that you were looking for and then find the associated agreement okay could you look from could you do it from the back end and search and see what information was being provided from Tennessee and then undo it, away, I don't know if the EDI data streams provide that kind of location information okay who would know that, trying to think of specific names, others within our company who handle those data streams would be in the IT department, but I don't know who this actual individuals are okay somebody in the IT department, yes okay great, was there any difference regarding the chargeback programs or incentive or rebate programs or their contractual agreements between the jurisdictions that you discussed earlier and Tennessee it was everything kind of the same to form all of our chargeback agreements and customer agreements were set up for the full Corporation so the if the company was a national company the agreement applied consistently across the country okay and what about if it was, a national company say it was a regional company or a smaller company was there a kind of a standard agreement for that or how would that work all of these agreements were negotiated agreements most often were written on the distribution customers paper and so they started the process and we're in there the format that they chose we negotiated terms as part of establishment of the relationship and to the extent that these would be, General customers any of those Regional distributor entities are reasonable Pharmacy chains the agreement would apply consistently throughout their entire region business okay and if I wanted to find out who specifically was getting chargebacks in Tennessee how would I find that out,again we would have to look at the chargeback transactions and find any of those that were Tennessee landed in Tennessee okay and who would I ask for that with a bi t or chargeback Department who would that be, that would be handled in our rebates processing team, okay and then earlier you were talking about the various types of information you got the reports that the IMs data on the various other reports that you could receive did you ever receive you meaning Mallinckrodt ever receive data at a Statewide level broken down by state, in the past we did receive IMS data which were broken down at a state level for certain data sets prescription data specifically, okay when you say in the past when was that so During the period of time that we marketed branded opioid products, generally between about 2008 2009 and 2015 or 16 at that time we did purchase what IMS refers to as sub National Data so, either in the exponent data which gave physician level information or in the sub-national data sets both of those data sets could be aggregated by state okay and when you say it was broken down by prescription data sets what does that mean generally I am s provides two different data feeds which we purchase one is sales information relative to unit volumes and that's universe, volumes being purchased by pharmacies and then they also provide prescription information which is a collection of information and projection of total Market relative to prescriptions dispensed from pharmacies to patients okay and who would have been responsible for reviewing that state level information, that state level information was reviewed by the commercial analytics team or also called Global business insights and forecasting that team would have had access to state level data and as necessary they would have looked at entire State data more often they aggregated by territory and region, okay so I'm going to try to put this in a little bit more understandable terms so that IMS data would show you from Tennessee I want to make sure I'm understanding you because I don't do the pharmacy thing on would show you say oxygen Eric oxycodone how much of that was going to an individual Pharmacy I must I must prescription data will show the number of prescriptions filled, old for a given product and state was part of the identifiers included so it would show how many prescriptions were filled for Oxycodone for the state of Tennessee that would be one data point you could analyze okay could you also do it by county, so in the exponent data set from IMS we had zip code level information I don't know if County was represented or if you'd have to aggregate but during those years I just want to make sure I understand it so during those years when you all were getting that IMS data 2008-2009 to roughly 2015 you would get for example how much Oxycodone was being prescribed and or, or filled by ZIP code, hi I'm not certain if we got that level of data for prescribed okay there's there's there are two different views to the prescription data that I am as provides they do provide some view to prescribe quantities K and then they do provide A View to dispensed quantities the Gap in the middle there's anything that just, don't get filled at the pharmacy okay and I know that they dispense data we received at a detailed zip code level I don't know if we received the prescription was written data at that level okay and who would do that, that would probably at this point be a matter of digging into the data and trying to find what's in there okay and so responsible for that for looking at that data and kind of ingesting it would have been the commercial analytics team is that right that's correct okay and do you know if the commercial analytics team would communicate any of that information to the, sales team or two suspicious order monitoring team, I know that commercial analytics summarized results by territory and provided those results to the sales team so that they could evaluate performance okay what about communicating those numbers to the suspicious order monitoring folks just go I am not aware if they did or not who would know that, the people involved in suspicious order monitoring, do you know how long Mallinckrodt retains that data, interactive Forum how long we retain what the IMs data that you received many of the data sets including the ZIP code level exponent data were our data feed was lost when we into the contract we do, do have some archived exponent data I don't know I can't personally speak to how complete that data is for the entire period of time we sold these products and you know who would now where that information is so the data that we did have the exponent data that we did have has been produced in the mdl I volunteer lawyers yes okay, and how do you know it's been produced I was told it's been okay you were you involved in producing it personally not personally involved now okay we're people that report to you involved in producing it I helped identify that it may still exist and told people where to look okay great, okay fantastic and then earlier on you were talking about, strike that hold on for just one second, okay earlier on you were talking about different databases and reports that that Mallinckrodt consults in connection with the sale marketing or distribution of its opioid products and when you talked about all of those were there any specific reports other than the IMs data that we just talked about that would have had to do a Tennessee, outside of IMS data I'm not aware of any Tennessee specific reports okay what about any reports that were created or that you ever saw that would have to do with maybe the Appalachian region of Tennessee or the Appalachian region of the country I'm not aware of any specific reports that nature okay what about Regional reports maybe the u.s. South did you ever see any Regional reports about opioid use or sales or, getting of opioids in the south of the United States no okay, okay and when you were talking about your marketing expenditures earlier those broken down by region at all know our marketing expenditures for Branded products were at most broken down by the product but not detailed at a regional level okay which reminds me I'm I had a question from earlier that I meant to follow up on when you talk about branded opioid products you talked about and I'm going to totally mispronounces, it was the exert to miss its Artemis start a canvass their tennis you say it differently than I do and I'm sure you're correct and I've just read it too much okay and then he's all go correct in my saying that one is okay and then you talked a little bit about Roxy codone being a branded opioid is that right Roxy codone itself is technically a branded product okay it is classified as a brand, by FDA has that brand name on the label Mallinckrodt owns the asset owns the rights to that product and we do still manufacture and sell that product in very small quantities we have never promoted or marketed that product okay and then there's also a generic of that Roxy code own action asked and answered duplicative go ahead Mallinckrodt and, about 12 other companies make it generic direct okay so now we've talked about star 10s, priced on messed it up exha go rocks ecotone where there are other branded opioid products that Mallinckrodt had an answer, at one point in time we did also sell Magna set okay yeah, and we did so a product that contained an opioid but was not a pain product and that Stussy caps okay we talked about those before other than that anything else those are kind of the person the only ones okay great, okay and do you know,if the marketing results for your branded products are broken down by region at all, the term marketing results go ahead our sales results would have been broken down by sales territory and by region and that would have been in terms of prescriptions of our products okay so you when you were talking before about kind of tracking your return on investment want to make sure I understood that as well I'm so I want to get back at way up we're going to go real basic so now I've got General, he is going to spend some money on marketing its products and trying to Target people in order to get them to prescribe their products right we generally had a marketing budget for a branded products in order to support our selling efforts okay and then you can tell if those marketing efforts have been successful or Not by how many prescriptions are written for your product in a particular territory is that right, in terms of analyzing specific marketing efforts it's really difficult to determine when an individual marketing a marketing effort has been successful in general when we set our plans and our marketing budgets we looked at our overall expectations for the amount of activity that our sales team was going to make in a given year and the the, Nations around market share or growth in market share for our products when doing that we determined what a reasonable marketing budget would be based on the efforts that we thought were needed and what those efforts cost is any of that broken down by region or state no okay so everything is just kind of nationally this is what we're doing you're not doing a different marketing plan for a region for example, no over efforts were National okay, you said before that you're aware of the opioid crisis are you we're specifically about the opioid crisis in Tennessee, I am not aware of specific details about the situation Tennessee okay have you ever heard of something called neonatal abstinence syndrome checked into scope I believe I have seen the term okay and what do you understand it to me I believe it is a situation involving neonates born to mothers who, had been taking opioids prior to delivery and those neonates then being free of the opioid being free of the opioid that not not receiving the opioid anymore I've you want to say it okay you're saying it in a very scientific way if you say it in another way is it babies that are born dependent on opioids to your understanding, to my understanding that's the the resulting condition when a baby is born dependent upon a okay and do you know where Tennessee ranks in the number of babies that are born with neonatal abstinence syndrome no I don't okay when is the first time you think you've heard about new natal abstinence syndrome,the first time I heard the term I believe was when, reading the label for Exotica okay, have you ever been involved in any meetings or any discussions about neonatal abstinence syndrome and any amount Kratts products no I'm not okay what about for opioids in general no I'm not okay, have you ever heard of the acronym hit da H I'm sorry a hidta, no I don't think so have you ever heard of something called the Appalachian high intensity drug trafficking area, sections of scope, yeah I don't think so okay, do you know of anyone at Mallinckrodt was looking at rates of Naas in East Tennessee, I'm not aware if anyone was looking at that okay and who if I were to try to figure out who would have been do you know which department that would have fallen under, so Market surveillance of Adverse Events would have been there's possibility of pharmacovigilance okay, and would that same Department have also been monitoring opioid related deaths that same Department would have monitored reports of deaths or other Adverse Events related to specifically our products, when you say specifically our products what do you mean, relating specifically to reports involving specific Mallinckrodt products as opposed to General opioid reports so if it was actually codone if they didn't know it was Mallinckrodt you wouldn't necessarily have been monitoring that but if it's Mallinckrodt opioid then that's something that would have been monitored it's by General understanding that the pharmacovigilance process is didn't capture information on unidentified, products of that nature okay do you know how products are identified or somebody dies which product I don't know the details of how that would be identified sure it would be different depending on the case, Okay earlier we were talking about the process used to determine which medical professionals your sales representatives would individually contact with respect to your opioid products remember that conversation from earlier today yes do you know who the sales reps targeted in Tennessee, I don't know specifically they targeted no Kate do you know who would, I don't believe there's anyone at the company Who would know those specifics and I don't know if there were if they're still documents that would have it okay why would there not be documents about that anymore I'm just not aware of those documents okay and why would nobody from the company know anymore there are very few people still with our company who sold these products in the past okay and those, our with the company were not directly involved with that level of detail okay and when did you I'm sorry I think you'd said that before was it 2015 that that program stopped generally 2015 our marketing efforts around branded opioids ceased okay and that would be your specific sales targeting of doctors for sales terms of doctors for sales, creation of marketing materials and marketing plans okay so you don't know if anyone was flagged for removal from a sales Target list for Mallinckrodt in Tennessee I don't know specific to Tennessee you know okay do you know where I could find that information officer answered the scene, you would have to find the old sales plans and I don't know where those are kept, somebody in the sales department would know sales department doesn't exist anymore so it would probably be captured in emails and other collected correspondence okay to your knowledge there weren't any documents that were destroyed by mail and cried about sales to my knowledge no okay you so you didn't see anything that was like okay sales departments going away let's get rid of all the documents, I didn't hear anything like that no okay so hypothetically the document should still exist just probably in a different spot, hypothetically okay okay, did Mallinckrodt distribute opioids to online retailers, objective scope there's a specific topic about online pharmacies that's designated for different Witness, okay but I think it's also encompassed and number 27 so did Mallinckrodt distribute opioids online retailers objective scope 27 read to the extent not Encompass with other topics and there's a specific topic about online can you can answer the question same objection I am not aware of ever selling opioids to online retailers okay, you ever heard of a person named Abu abdulrahman Muhammad, no I don't think so the prescriber in Tennessee no okay what about Timothy gelder, no I don't think so okay so you haven't been involved in any discussions about mr. Mohammed or mr. gowda know okay what about Gary Arlen more, I don't believe so okay have you ever heard of a doctor name's David Florence, no he also had a very brief reality show called dockstar heard of dockstar section 2 scope no I've never heard of that okay what about Marc Murphy, Ed White, I know I person named Ed White I don't know if it's the same person does the Ed White that you know live in Tennessee I don't believe so okay does he operate a medical clinic of some sort no he's not different guy okay what about Pam light, okay do you ever hear any discussions about any particular medical clinics or doctors offices with in Tennessee during your time at Mallinckrodt, no, okay, were you involved at all in the DEA investigation of Sunrise Wholesale in Delray Beach Florida injection is help, the matters are specifically designated another topic is designated for another witness okay now I was not involved,do you know what Mallinckrodt share was of the opioid Market in Tennessee, no I do not I'm going to give you some different times from 2005 to 2010 did you know what the market share was a male guard opioids in Tennessee no we never analyzed share of opioid market and by state at all okay and what about from 2010 to the present no I do not know okay,have you ever heard of Tennessee being referred to as ground zero for the opioid crisis, no I don't think so okay what about West Virginia, to school, I don't know if I've heard the specific term Ground Zero but I have heard about West Virginia okay have you heard generally about Appalachia kind of West Virginia Kentucky the mountain region being particularly hard hit by opioid abuse issues I'm personally aware from the news media about the opioid issues in the Appalachia region okay and where do you think you first became aware of that, I don't remember specifically, if I had to guess it would be somewhere around maybe 2010 okay do you know how you became aware of it, the press and the news media okay not through your official duties at Mount cross no okay if you ever heard of something called the oxy Express affection to scope, now okay you heard about I-75 being a drug trafficking corridor from Florida to Ohio actions go this is getting into diversion issues that are designated for different witness also has to do with abuse, I don't know if I've heard specifically about I-75 okay have you heard generally about there being some Highway some taking pills from Florida North I've heard generally about pattern of involvement with Florida okay and where did you hear that, again generally in the news media okay but not through your official involvement at Mallinckrodt, not that I can recall okay so based on this information that you had from Appalachia being particularly hard hit by the opioid abuse epidemic and this kind of movement of pills going from some Florida up north where is there any differential or different way that the Appalachian State's were treated At All by Mallinckrodt in any of the topics we've discussed today, so when we on in the generics business when we contract with our wholesale and distributor customers or with Pharmacy chains we contract with them based upon their entire scope of operation whether that's Nationwide or Regional and we have processes in place that allow us to, to work with them to ensure that both sides are complying with the regulations involved with shipment of the products that we sell them if there are specific issues with an individual Distribution Center or Pharmacy chain or other type of customer we have processes in place to, to address that, it's a very long answer about very specific things but my question is was there any sort of a regional change that was made like hey guys you know we got this issue going on in Appalachia so we're going to watch our customers customers to see what's going on who they're shipping to or we're going to put out an alert to all of our customers that they need to watch their customers customers you know to see what's going on and the Appalachian region was there any differential and in that regard rejection of the form of the question, kitchen beyond the scope of the topics for this Witness, I am not aware of anything like that that occurred and and have not prepared speak to that okay so the topics you did speak on today though having to do with abuse having to do with sales having to do with compensation having to a chargeback information all the topics that you've talked about I just want to be clear that there wasn't any differential that was for the Appalachian region or for Tennessee actually the former question, any of the programs that you mentioned relative to targeting and incentivizing the Branded sales team or administering contracts with our distribution Partners more all established at a national level consistent with our overall plans or business processes okay so to piggyback off of that and so nothing was nobody was treated differently if they were in Appalachia, Tennessee you treated all states to say, our decisions were made for individual, distributors or prescribers based upon the activity at that particular customer or prescriber and it was not catered to a certain region but more to the specific activity sometimes I'm going to repeat my question one more time so I can be really clear about it I just want to know for sales or for compensation or incentives or any of those things that you've talked about understanding, sometimes things are treated differently based on individual circumstances but from a regional or a state level everything was the same nobody was treated differently in Appalachia or Tennessee is they were Countrywide attraction to form, it's just a yes or no I I still will go back to my same answer that the plans we put in place we're consistent on a nationwide basis and consistent across our business if there were individual Healthcare practitioners or individual distributors or wholesalers purchasing product from us that, did not abide by the agreements that were in place we took action on that specific incident we did not take action on a regional basis based upon other information okay or on a Statewide basis based on other information or in a Statewide basis that's correct okay if we can just stop the rocket for a

ghfk0146,"coming up next the guest on our first viewer call in program this evening we'll talk about a recent government report on the effects of smoking the director of the office on smoking and health at the Center for Disease Control dr. Ronald Davis will take your questions and comments about government efforts to combat smoking and the diseases associated with smoking, dr. Ronald Davis director of the u.s. office on smoking and health and whose office prepared the report that was released on Tuesday called smoking and health and National status report what is the status of smoking and health in this country today well the status is a gremlin in terms of deaths caused by smoking we estimate that 390,000, kids are dying every year from diseases caused by smoking which include lung cancer emphysema other cancers heart disease and a variety of other diseases that are caused by smoking so there's a tremendous health impact of smoking and the 390,000 deaths that's the equivalent of 1,000 Americans dying every day from this deadly Behavior but what this report focused on was the economic impact of smoking and not only is there a huge health impact but a huge economic, comic impact as well and we estimated in this report that smoking was responsible for fifty two billion dollars economic impact in the United States about half of which is health care costs from the treatment of smoking-related diseases but about half of which is also for lost productivity people dying prematurely and their productivity lost from our society or people disabled or people losing extra days from work because of smoking related symptoms and disease, isn't that fifty two billion dollar figure which is enormous that is the equivalent of two hundred and twenty dollars for every person in this Society so we're all paying for the diseases that smoking causes whether we smoke or not secretary Sullivan presented the report to Congress on Tuesday what's been the reaction so far well I think that there's been a favorable reaction to the report people are most impressed with these economic figures, as we all know I think about the health effects of smoking but people don't realize that they're paying a hidden taxes he called it for smoking higher taxes higher health insurance premiums even if you don't smoke you're paying these things and in One Way Or Another We're All paying for this deadly destructive addicting behavior in his presentation secretary Louis Sullivan also predicted that a goal would be smoke free Society in 10 years by the year 2000 how realistic do you think that is it depends on, how you define it when former Surgeon General C Everett Koop announced his goal for smoke free Society by the year 2000 which announced in 1984 he didn't really mean that we would have 0 smokers by the year 2000 that is not going to happen we will still probably be left with at least a group of Hardcore smokers who don't give it up no matter what we say but what he did in Vision was a society by the year 2000 in which it would be smoke-free for the vast majority, authority of people who choose not to smoke in other words smokers would only be smoking in the privacy of their own homes so that non-smokers would not be forced to take in this toxic gas that is being released by the cigarettes of smokers our phone lines are open the subject is specifically the smoking and health a national status report issued to a release to Congress and the public on Tuesday we have its principal author at least the man who directed the work behind this report our phone lines, is our phone numbers are on the screen for you to use you can begin dialing now as you address your comments or questions to dr. Ronald Davis director of the u.s. office on smoking and health a couple things right off the bat do you smoke no I don't have you ever smoked no more than a few cigarettes experimenting like probably all teenagers do this report is 390 pages long is this the totality of the reporters or some compendium of other related data that it, it is comes along with it that's the report it's the second edition we're actually required by Congress to produce a national status report on smoking every two years and this is the second such report that we've produced our office is also responsible for producing the annual surgeon general's report on the health consequences of smoking so we're coming out with one or two reports to Congress on smoking every year why don't you talk briefly about the breadth of what's in this book this report basically looks at what's happened in the last few years with, expect to smoking in terms of the number of deaths that are caused by smoking in terms of the economic impact of smoking as I mentioned already and what this report provides is a state-by-state analysis of deaths and the economic costs from smoking and what it reveals is that not only do we have this huge impact at the national level but there's a tremendous variation in the health and economic impact of smoking from one state to another for example in terms of economic costs the economic cost of smoking very, from a high of about two hundred and eighty four dollars per person in Rhode Island to 56 dollars per person in Utah Utah has the lowest smoking rate in the country only about 15 percent of adults in Utah smoke so one value in this report is that we now have specific information on what's happening at the state level it also reviews what's happening legislatively and it shows that as you might expect that more and more legislation is restricting smoking and, public places and in the workplace and there's also a section on State and local programs on smoking to help people who smoke quit and to prevent teenagers from taking up this behavior and what we've seen over the last couple of years is that there's a growing number of programs available to help people quit so that smokers if they feel that they would need some assistance including they shouldn't despair more than likely there are programs in their own Community to help them quit how would somebody get a copy of the report, they could get a copy by writing our office which is office on smoking and health and that's 5600 Fisher's Lane Rockville Maryland 2008 57 I and what do you say in the report about tobacco other than cigarettes we do have the results of a survey we conducted a 1986 a national survey of adults on all variety of uses of tobacco including cigars and pipes and smoke, Alice tobacco that is chewing that is chewing tobacco and snuff and what we've seen is that cigar and pipe smoking have gone down dramatically in the last 20 years or so but with respect to chewing tobacco and snuff we've seen the trends going in the opposite direction and we've seen a tremendous increase in the use of snuff and chewing tobacco particularly in young boys who more often than not are emulating the professional athletes in particular professional baseball players who are using these products on the baseball, fields and shown of course on national television and that's a big problem those products cause mouth cancer and that can be fatal dr. Davis let's take the first call this one from Facts Lake Illinois go ahead please you're on the air, yes you were talking about the economic impact people that smoke what about all the people that smoke and drink what is the economic impact of people quit smoking, well then quit drinking, the economic impact of alcohol use and abuse is also very high and in fact there are social costs and economic costs from alcoholism that we're all well aware one particular problem with with alcohol and smoking is that they interact actually to tremendously increase some of the health risks that users will face for example if somebody smokes and drinks alcohol excessively they have a tremendously, increased risk of getting cancer of the mouth or cancer of the larynx the voice box so there are also very high social and economic cost from alcoholism and for the person who uses and abuses alcohol as well as smoke cigarettes there's a very high cost what is your professional specialty I specialize in preventive medicine and our guest has also received a ba from the University of Michigan and 1978 he also has training at the University of, Chicago master of arts public policy studies and he's originally from Chicago Illinois and the next call for him is from New York City go ahead please you're on the air thank you dr. Davis what can we do to ask government to stop subsidizing the tobacco Farmers all right thank you why certainly would understand the concern that you have and that other people have where you have two arms of government apparently acting inconsistently and the, is that that our mission is Health while the mission of the US Department of Agriculture which administers the tobacco subsidy program has a different Mission and that is to help the u.s. farmer and the answer that I would give to your question is that the concerns you have you should express your congressman, given that dichotomy is it possible to say that there is a an official position of the federal government on smoking, there are many official positions of the US government on smoking and they're not always totally in concert and we just have to concentrate on our own mission and our mission is to promote good health to prevent disease and enhance the quality of life and that's what we do and by we you mean your department that's right so it would be incorrect to say that the federal government has adopted by receiving this report any single position on smoking, well we do have very clear and definite positions on smoking and health it just so happens that the US Department of Agriculture sets policy related to Tobacco farming and growing and agriculture we have another part of the federal government that has to do with trade policies on Tobacco and there are many other examples that I could give you where other parts of the federal government are more focused on one aspect of tobacco, whereas the area of tobacco that we're most interested in is preventing its use and preventing smoking-related disease all right Pueblo Colorado is next go ahead yes I was wondering like on asbestos where they see that causes lung disease or this Rocky Mountain Arsenal weather everything shows that it's always on account of smoking yet they tear down a lot of buildings on a kind of asbestos that rock, about North Fulton are people all the time because it causes cancer is there any kind of study I could get his to break down whether everything is caused by smoking when you here in the paper all the time that there's a lot of other things that cause lung cancer besides smoking thank you there are many causes of lung cancer but cigarette smoking is at the top of the list and we estimate that cigarette smoking accounts for about 85 to 90 percent of all deaths, from lung cancer in our society now asbestos does cause some cases of lung cancer of course especially for those who have worked in an environment where they've been exposed to asbestos for a number of years and again like the case of alcohol and smoking here's another example where if you smoke and are exposed to asbestos your risk of getting lung cancer has tremendously increased if you only smoke but aren't exposed to asbestos you have about a five-fold increase, risk of getting lung cancer if you're exposed to asbestos but but don't smoke you also have about a five fold increased risk but if you have both of those exposures you have about a 50 fold increased risk of lung cancer so again you have to be particularly careful not to have any risk factors but especially not to have a combination of risk factors we've got half an hour to go with dr. Ronald Davis the subject is smoking and health and the next call is from Westville Illinois go ahead, yes I'd like to know why our government with this being such a dangerous drug, as allowing this to go on and fighting marijuana and Other Drugs that have a less of a death rate, well there are of course many problems associated with illegal drug use and I don't need to tell anybody about those it's very clear that we have a lot of violence we have organized crime involvement we have a lot of social problems that come out of the use of illegal drugs but you do make an important point that if you look solely at the number of people who die from illegal drugs that number is actually dwarfed by the people who died, die from the legal addicting drugs in our society and those are tobacco and alcohol primarily and as I said we have almost 400,000 Americans dying every year from cigarette smoking that's more than one out of every six deaths in this country alcohol and alcohol abuse claim another 100,000 or so if you look at the number of people who die from cocaine and heroin and marijuana you're on the you're talking about somewhere around, Americans who are dying from the use of those drugs that's not to minimize the social impact of those drugs which is tremendous but in terms of deaths tobacco and alcohol are at the top of the list dr. Davis quickly before the next call does this report contain recommendations the report does contain some recommendations and the Secretary of Health and Human Services dr. Sullivan made several recommendations when he released this report and when he testified before Congress he's calling for all sectors of society really to, do more to oppose smoking in our societies calling for smoke-free environments wherever people mingle he's calling on the private sector to do more for example he's already why don't we get to some of those recommendations after this next all and this is from Jacksonville Florida go ahead I'm I'm calling in regard to addiction according to dr. Koop, nicotine addiction is as strong as heroin cocaine alcohol all of those addictions including bulimia you can name almost any kind of addiction there are Clinic to help people overcome these addictions clinics full-time clinics the people can go to and get real help, I think cigarette nicotine addiction gets the short end of the stick we get really very little help the American Cancer Society has a little weekly meeting a pat on the head and you go home and do it all by yourself I've been smoking longer than either two of you have been alive I would like to quit smoking but I need some help and I think if I could find a clinic like alcoholics can like bulimic span like obese people can I might, stand a chance of getting off cigarettes but I cannot do it alone with one little stinking meeting a week and I think even spent all those millions that you're spending on other things on really helping people we might get somewhere with wiping out nicotine addiction well we want to do all we can to help smokers like yourself quit and you hit the nail on the head by pointing out that nicotine can be as addicting as as heroin and cocaine as Surgeon General former Surgeon General Coupe said when he released, report on that subject in 1988 about eighty percent of smokers say they'd like to quit and most of them have been unable to quit despite repeated attempts to quit and so that certainly goes against the tobacco industry's argument that this is just a matter of free choice their best clients would like to give it up but are controlled by this strong nicotine addiction what I would suggest is that if you're someone who feels that you need help I would first of all call your local Cancer Society or longer associated, ation or Heart Association and see what materials they may have available for you there are many self-help materials where you can walk yourself through your own quit smoking kit for example and that's what they provide to you or they may have quit smoking programs that they will provide either at low cost or for free if you have a real strong physical addiction and for example if you smoke more than a pack a day if you light up that first cigarette within 30 minutes after Awakening if you smoke when you're sick, or where it's forbidden those are all clues that you have a strong physical addiction then you may benefit from a prescription prescription for nicotine chewing gum which you can obtain through a prescription from your physician so I would see your physician if you fit into some of those categories why do you need a prescription for nicotine chewing gum the nicotine gum is is a drug and it's licensed by the Food and Drug Administration and it's it's only licensed for sale by having a physician's prescription, option is that contradictory that you can buy a cigarette without prescription but you need prescription for nicotine gum many people would argue that and some people have argued that that tobacco itself ought to be regulated say by the Food and Drug Administration or some other Federal agency because it contains this addicting drug nicotine that is carefully controlled when it's in gum Daly City California go ahead hi I was just hoping maybe you could give me some advice, ice on how I could possibly get my mother to quit smoking I mean maybe I couldn't get her to do both but to quit smoking and drinking she's been she's 47 almost 48 and she does it every single day and she does it all the time and she expressed a desire to quit well I remember her quitting once when I was a teenager and it didn't last very long she had gained weight she was upset by that but, she hasn't really she pretty much is in with the attitude that well my beer and cigarettes are all I have and and I just wish you wouldn't do it mostly for her health but also because I do not like cigarettes and you know and I drink maybe once or twice a year I just wish you'd quit it mostly for her health I'm very concerned about her alright thank you Bruce just made the important point that you first have to have motivation to quit and if you don't have that motivation nobody's going to quit, it but it's difficult to give you a general answer because what we've seen is that Smokers smoke for a variety of different reasons so I'm have a strong psychological addiction some have a strong physical addiction and most smokers probably fall somewhere in the middle and if they have a strong physical addiction they may benefit from nicotine chewing gum if they don't perhaps they need more counseling and behavioral treatment but I think the main point that needs to be made is that you need your mother needs one on one, whistling I think to find out why she smokes and then the therapy can be personalized to her actually about ninety percent of smokers who quit quit on their own so many people feel that it's just a matter of willpower they make a decision to quit and then they quit but the remaining 10% need help and they should be able to get help and some will choose self-help materials others will want to have counseling others may even want to be hospitalized and there are few programs that even hospitalized people were nicotine detoxification just like, like those who were hospitalized for alcohol detox before we get through with this segment I want to squeeze in some of these recommendations that secretary Sullivan made that are not contained in this report and you were ready to go through that list why don't you continue that one thing that secretary Sullivan has already recommended he's recommended directly to the convenience stores he's written to the association that represents all the large convenience store chains in this country to enforce the laws that exist in 44 states that prohibit the sale of tobacco, miners I think we could prevent a lot of kids from taking up tobacco if we simply made it more difficult for them to get tobacco and 44 states have these laws on the books but they're not enforced at all and of course how can you enforce them when you have vending machines practically on every corner that allow kids to buy of course without any verification of age the other thing he's done is he's in the process of writing all the hospital seven thousand hospitals across the country that participate in the Medicare program urging them to go smoke-free to, I'd a Clean Indoor Air environment for the staff for the patients and the visitors at these hospitals he's going to be launching a campaign that focuses in on smoking among minorities and women and in youth the populations that are often smoking at higher rates than the overall population Huntsville Alabama go ahead, hello how are you doing fine think I'm interested in knowing if you really believe you can do an honest study of the cost for instance how do you prove that cigarettes doesn't make don't make some people more productive if somebody dies it just about retirement age that's Optimum they don't draw money later, it's a very complicated question anxiety levels have very serious effects on your productivity it may be that they continue smoking you're good for some people things out in levels Holly do you believe that or emphatically I believe it are you a smart don't know how to measure it yesterday spoke of course I'd like to quit too but it's not an unmitigated awful thing as some of these studies, Trend in Lee make it out to be how long have you smoked 25 years how much do you smoke three packs the anything else, I mean you have anything else you want to say I don't I was very interested in hearing him react to that all right cause it's pretty hard for me to believe you can honestly assess the about the economic impact of such a thing all right thank you we can't measure all of the effects of smoking but we can at least measure several objective facts about smoking you're right some smokers feel that their stress is relieved by smoking and they think that they are more productive when allowed to smoke on the, hand the vast majority of people in our society are non-smokers and most of them are bothered by passive smoking by exposure to other people smoke and they feel that their productivity is worsened by having to breathe other people smoke also smokers spend several minutes out of everyday lighting up a cigarette and taking smoking breaks and while that might not be a big expense for the individual you multiply it across the whole population of 50 million smokers in the United States, it's and that adds up but the objective facts are that smokers are more likely much more likely to die prematurely they're much more likely to lose days from work because of illnesses caused by smoking and yeah those things up and that's how we come up with a fairly conservative estimate of fifty two billion dollars for direct health care costs and lost productivity due to smoking related diseases the collar raises an interesting point though do you see as a medical person and one whose integral to this report any, positive aspects of smoking, I actually think that tobacco has no redeeming qualities and people often bring up well if we regulate tobacco and this way what's going to follow for example if we restrict tobacco advertising are we then going to restrict advertising for alcohol or automobiles don't cars kill people or red meat doesn't that kill people and my answer to them is that too in the point that dr. Sullivan made a few days ago is that tobacco is the only product that when used exactly as intended, it kills people and dr. Sullivan pointed out that it is wrong to promote a product that when used as intended kills people you can't say that about alcohol or cars or red meat those products more often than not those products do have at least some redeeming qualities certainly automobiles do certainly meet provides important nutritional quality as long as it's consumed in moderation but if these products are used as intended in moderation even alcohol it's safe but tobacco it's, it's dangerous its deadly it's costly when used as intended Scottsdale Arizona you're next yeah what I'm trying to say is not like the doctor's opinion on that that what they're doing right now it's wonderful with keeping kids and everybody for something to not to smoke and if you don't glamorize it people is not going to smoke but I disagree of having it outlawed and policed, and then you're going to go right back like broad vision and everything else on that like you say well people are going to die a lot sooner and everything that's fine let it be let these people that smoke I know people that their parents smoke and the kids don't smoke all right 22 23 years old okay so thank you we agree that prohibition is not the answer and we're not recommending it I don't think anybody is seriously recommend, being a ban on Tobacco like we had a ban on alcohol earlier this Century I think most people agree that was a failed experiment but what we are saying is that we ought to give people a fair chance and right now tobacco industry is spending 2.6 billion dollars to portray this deadly addicting product as safe sexy and sophisticated and they're preying on the most vulnerable parts of our society more than 80 percent of smokers start to smoke as kids and their barraged with these deceptive advertising, sizing messages and what we're saying is let's at least protect the kids from this slanted point of view that they're getting it's not Freedom of Choice when you're trapping young kids as early as 8 10 12 years old with deceptive advertising and then they become addicted to the product and when they're adults they're no longer able to quit that a quarter hour left to go or next Call Yonkers New York I was an Alcoholic Anonymous before idea, we were taught that any addiction or drug e has to have a mind-altering when you smoke there is no mind-altering effect on the person the way you're talking a smoking it's a habit and if someone has the habit of cleaning a house thoroughly constantly it's compulsive for them does that mean they were drugging they aren't you there are actually very, criteria that we use to define a drug as addicting and one of those is that the drug affects the chemistry of the brain and the central nervous system and there's a large body of evidence that shows that nicotine affects the brain and the central nervous system just as addicting drugs do and while you may not feel like your mood is altered people in fact do have their mood altered by nicotine and we've identified parts of the brain tissue that that are what we call, the receptors for the chemical nicotine I think we're all familiar with some smokers who when they run out of a pack of cigarettes they'll scrounge through the garbage looking for perhaps a but of cigarette with with a little bit of tobacco left on it or they'll walk six blocks through the rain to buy a pack of cigarettes because they're going through such intense Cravings there are known physiologic symptoms for nicotine withdrawal that people, variants there is a great tendency to relapse when people quit and all of these things are part and parcel to drug addictions and nicotine meets the criteria for defining a drug as addicting just as well as the other drugs that we accept as addicting such as cocaine and heroin is your office a smoke-free workplace we are as a matter of fact the whole Department of Health and Human Services is smoke free and that affects about 120,000 employees of our department Nationwide so in fact, we're probably the largest smoke-free employer in the country does that mean that when you have couriers come into the waiting room they aren't allowed to smoke that's right smoking is only allowed outside the facility I'm not particularly happy that we do see a few employees who are smoking outside our entrance doors and some butts collect on the ground outside those doors but it's still a lot better than having people smoke inside where we'd all be exposed to the tobacco smoke and how long has it been smoke-free oh for a year or two, you recall if there was much resistance to that policy at the time there was not much resistance from smokers and that's one thing that we've seen across the country that work site smoking limitations and bands are accepted very well by employees smokers and non-smokers alike more than half of smokers according to public opinion polls endorse restrictions on smoking in public places and in the worksite and that's probably because they see a smoke-free environment as an additional, all motivator to help them quit perhaps the last thing that will finally help them kick this addiction Pasadena California you're next I think that all thinking Americans believe that cigarette smoking or tobacco is a is a killer but I think that our government is is quite ambiguous and I'm going back to the subsidies that the tobacco subsidies why would not our government subsidize the, tobacco Growers or increase the tobacco Growers to go into other crops and not be planting a killer plant that's a good question I think the simple answer to that is that tobacco happens to be one of the most lucrative cash crops that a farmer could grow and it may not be profitable for a tobacco farmer to all of a sudden switch from growing tobacco to another crop and what that points out the need to do is if and when the, partment of Agriculture or the US Congress should decide to abolish this program programs would need to be in place to assist tobacco Farmers to shift their crop Land from the growing of tobacco to the growing of crops that don't kill people Muskegon Michigan you're on the air I'm a nonsmoker and my question has to do with the workplace it seems to me we've got an agency in place now that could deal with this problem by declaring, tobacco cigarette smoke the same type of poison that we find in other chemical has that been addressed you mean the FDA I'm talking about Asha OSHA okay thank you the occupational safety and health administration or OSHA has been petitioned by some consumer groups to do as you suggest and that is to declare this under some emergency standard to be an occupational workplace, Toxin and to issue an emergency standard to either ban it or severely restrict smoking in the workplace and my understanding is that OSHA is investigating this their initial decision was to not issue an emergency standard on this topic but to to go through some more careful and protracted deliberations on this issue there is now some litigation before the courts trying to pressure, this agency to take the action that they were petitioned to take from an organization here in Washington called action on smoking and health or Ash so there is a lot of discussion of this issue and it's not a new idea and it's one that I think is going to be discussed more Manchester New Hampshire hi hi I'm requesting I quit smoking a year ago and I'm around cigarette smoking a lot my friends all smoke and I go out frequently around smoke, and I was wondering what can I do to help myself, are you able to convince The Smokers have you tried to convince The Smokers to smoke somewhere else no they say smoking my house smoking in your house yeah well I would establish a firm policy that no smoking is allowed in your house certainly a place like your home or your automobile for example that you have immediate control over I think you ought to Institute a policy no smoking I think you ought to point out to them and we can give you the literature to back back this, up that people who are exposed to tobacco smoke in the home have a higher risk of lung cancer and you ought to tell the guests that you have who smoke in your home about that and the case of your workplace certainly management can Institute rules that restrict or ban smoking in the workplace car do you feel you're able to Institute that policy in your own house I think without any complications you're going to do it I want to try all right thanks thank you Federal Way Washington is next go ahead please, he's thank you dr. Arya was spoken for over 50 years and the only way I gave it up with I got a good case of the flu bug for three days and for three days I didn't want to drink or eat anything but I think we're making too much of this created I agree that there's some people can die of this and then have but we can live two gunshot wounds and cancer and smoking such as I've done I would say this total why is it, that like dr. Cooper's mentioned that the cause of AIDS is the misuse of the rectum and why have North people in quarantine at first had this disease in the we are to sexual now are having to pay the price that they're not being quarantined all right sir thank you that let me first congratulate you for quitting smoking you've probably taken the one step that will improve your health and lengthen your life than any other step you can take I'm not going to going to discuss AIDS because I'm not here to, discuss AIDS but what I will say in reference to your statement that we make too much of this I just want you to know that you're lucky that it was pneumonia or the flu that convinced you to quit smoking rather than lung cancer because lung cancer is almost always fatal we don't cure lung cancer and that's why we see so many people dying of smoking every year Miami Florida it slow you're on the earth yes mr. Davis few people few callers have touched on the subject of tobacco subsidies and, I'd like to know if you have any estimate of how much the United States government spends on Tobacco subsidies each year and also if you know when the last, vote in the US House of Representatives or in the Senate was taken on Tobacco subsidies you don't have anything having to do with faculty subsidies and also when the next vote will be taken is supposed to be taken on anything having to do with tobacco subsidies do you know my recollection is in response to your first question that the administrative costs of the program are somewhere on the order of ten to twenty million dollars a year there may be much higher costs from, the program than that because loans that were made from the government to Tobacco Farmers over the course of many years have been defaulted on or some of those loans have been paid back at interest rates that were lower than the prime rate and those costs to the government into the taxpayer can add up to hundreds of millions of dollars in response to your question about when was the last time this was voted on it's actually I think somewhat surprising to me that there haven't been any votes just on the topic of the, go subsidy in Congress in recent years to my knowledge I actually was sitting in the chamber of the US Senate back maybe about six seven years ago when they voted on this and they may have been the last time it was voted on and the tobacco price support program won by a slim vote of about 40 to 41 so when it has been voted on it's barely survived in the past but I think that the reason why the program is still around today is that the the congressman from tobacco growing state, it's are able to keep the program from being voted on in a single vote on the floor of the House of the Senate Pompano Beach Florida go ahead yes I do my name is Bob I'd like to just call as a part of the 20% that do smoke I guess I know you've mentioned alcohol and drugs and various other things yeah I do believe that the cigarettes are addictive I'm an alcoholic drug addict, ex and I just I'm just really confused by the priorities of you know suddenly the smokers are the bad people, and you know the drug addicts and you know that that thing doesn't end enter into mr. coops presentations years ago or anything like that, flying on planes starting Sunday without smoking cigarettes I'm more offended by that but I'm also anything else I'd say thank you I think dr. Koop was filling a void in making a big issue out of tobacco because we've had a War on Drugs now for a long time and we've had high government officials and many other people making the war on drugs illegal drugs something that we probably hear more about than any other thing in our society so I, I don't think that tobacco is now getting a disproportionate amount of attention in fact it's getting attention that is long overdue tobacco smoke contains 4,000 chemicals including 43 that are known to cause cancer and so it's unfair to have non-smokers breathe in such a toxic gas in an enclosed environment like an airplane where they can't get up and walk away and in fact the National Academy of Sciences estimated that a flight attendant who was exposed to tobacco, smoke on airplanes is exposed to the equivalent amount of smoke as somebody who lives with a pack a day smoker so it's not an insignificant amount of exposure and we're talking about a very deadly gas here dr. Dave has time for one last call this one from Cheyenne Wyoming go ahead yeah I might mean reason I just wanted to call I told my children repeatedly about smoking and the main reason I won't quit smoking his I keep watching the government tell me I've got to do this and I've got to do that and until the, government gets out of my personal life, I'll just keep smoking how do you believe the government is telling you to quit smoking well after reading most of the studies that come out because my kids always hand them to me and having lived around scientists most of my life everyone in the quit smoking deal is keep saying we think we suppose, that isn't science that's a guess all right so thank you well I can say to that is that there no guesses around here there have been more than 50,000 scientific studies that have determined that cigarette smoking is harmful to health it's probably the most well-documented scientific finding in the history of biomedical research and if you won't quit smoking for the government quit smoking for your children because children whose parents smoke are not only more likely to get pneumonia and bronchitis, other respiratory diseases are more likely to take up smoking themselves because of the role model that you're setting and I have somebody in my family who's had a stroke caused by smoking and this person is in a vegetative state for 10 years now and think of the burden that that poses on a family and it's not just a decision that you're making that affects you it affects your children and your family and everyone around you final word in 15 seconds, I think the main point that needs to be made here is that of all the behaviors that we could do that are dangerous cigarette smoking is at the top of the list 390,000 people dying every year from this Behavior more than 1,000 a day people could do more for their health by quitting smoking than by any other single step thank you dr. Ronald Davis appreciate your time tonight thank you, we'll continue our discussion I ain't discussion on smoking and health this time with two different points of view represented by Walker merryman he's the vice president of the tobacco Institute and Aaron Lightman he's the president of citizens against tobacco smoke will be back in a few minutes, a universal newsreel of 1961 President John F Kennedy he's first year in office and his first State of the Union Address, the Congress convenes and join session to hear President Kennedy's first state of the union message a grave challenge to the nation and the legislature to prepare for serious perils abroad and economic recession at home the president proclaimed this a time of national Peril and of national opportunity as he sums up the economic picture, in short the American economy is in trouble the most resourceful industrialized country on Earth ranks among the Lost in the rate of economic growth since last spring our economic growth rate has actually declined business investment is in a declined profits have fallen below predicted levels construction is off a million unsold automobiles are an inventory, fewer people are working and the average work week as shrug well below 40 hours yet prices have continued to rise so that now too many Americans have less to spend for items that cost more to buy no man entering upon this office regardless of his party regardless of his previous service in Washington could fail to be staggered, upon learning even then this brief 10-day period the harsh enormities of the trials through which we must pass in the next four years each day the crises multiply each day their solution grows more difficult each day we draw nearer the hour of Maximum danger As Weapons spread and hostile forces grow stronger, I feel I must inform the Congress that our analysis over the next last 10 days make it clear that in each of the principal areas of Crisis the tide of events has been running out and time has not been our friend, mr. Kennedy refers to the Soviet Challenge and Latin America we are pledged to work with our sister republics to free the Americas of all such foreign domination and all tyranny working towards the goal of a free hemisphere of free governments extending from Cape Horn to the Arctic Circle we must increase our support of the, Nations as an instrument to end the Cold War instead of an arena in which to fight it in recognition of its increasing importance and the doubling of its membership we are enlarging and strengthening our own mission to the UN we shall help ensure that it is properly financed we shall work to see that the Integrity of the office of the Secretary General is maintained, wife and 1961 will not be easy wishing it predicting it even asking for it will not make it so there will be further setbacks before the tide has turned but turn it we must, go behind the scenes of the events and issues you can following on C-Span subscribe to the C-SPAN update designed with the C-SPAN

from citizens against tobacco smoke and Walker merryman vice-president of the tobacco Institute will take your questions and comments about smoking policies on airplanes tobacco advertising and a bill now in Congress to fight smoking, Walker merryman vice-president of the tobacco Institute what in your judgment is the proper role of the Federal Government in the matter of smoking, I think the role of the Federal Government with respect to smoking is to give people information which they have an abundance of much of it from the government much of it from the media and then to leave people alone to make their own decisions about whether or not they wish to smoke let me ask the same question will probably get a different point of view this from Aaron Lightman he's the president of citizens against tobacco smoke what's the proper role of the government we feel the proper role of the government is to protect the public health and, that can be done in several ways including the distribution of information but each day in this nation we have a very rich and Powerful tobacco industry spending an average of seven and a half million dollars a day promoting The Addictive and harmful tobacco products and the federal government each year only spends three and a half million dollars a year so we have twice the annual budget spent daily by the tobacco industry and that is about to change under some newly proposed Federal legislation, pleased to have our guest this evening each representing a different side in the debate on smoking and we expect that they'll want to have plenty of time to get their points of view on the table and you'll like the same so we're opening the phones right now we'll put the phone numbers on the screen so you can begin dialing as you think about what you would say to them or ask them and we'll go to the phone straight away after we learn a little bit more about who they are and where they stand back to you mr. Merriman quickly a little bit about the tobacco Institute the tobacco Institute is the trade Association that represents, represents the nation cigarette manufacturers and manufacturers of other tobacco products we do lobbying we do public relations were based here in Washington DC and have been since 1958 how big is your budget that's something we don't make public mr. Lightman same thing what is citizens against tobacco smoke well one of the things we do is try and find out what the budget of the tobacco industry or Institute is and according to Congressional sources it is something like 30 million dollars a year which is quite a substantial budget, citizens against tobacco smoke was formed in October of 1985 at the conclusion of the First World Conference on non-smokers rights which was sponsored by action on smoking and health here in Washington DC we started out as a coalition of forty two groups and decided to do something about this issue of Airline smoking and we created a campaign known as smoke free Skies it did take us three and a half years to win the airline smoking ban which takes effect this son, and a February 25th and on that ban all flights that begin and end in the United States under six hours of length will be affected that's virtually 99 and 44 100 percent of the nation's 18,000 domestic airline flights and it has been heralded as one of the most significant victories we've had against the tobacco industry in the history of the US Congress and how big is your budget we have a very miniscule budget which is proprietary all right so, you want to offer a guess as to his budget I've no idea it really fascinates me that people have an interest in other people's monetary Affairs well let me go back to the subject at hand that is and I'll ask you both this before we go to the phones they report on smoking and health that was required by Congress was presented to it by a doctor Louis Sullivan on Tuesday what's your reaction to the contents of that report well as I recall the vast amount of media coverage, courage was focused on that portion of his testimony and Report which had to do with what he called the social costs of smoking and I think it's inappropriate to put it in that context because any costs that might be incurred if you accept the the argument that smokers are likely to die earlier if they smoke and so forth are personal individual costs which aren't born by, Wyatt e as a whole and I think that if you take the argument to that that step then what you're implying perhaps more stronger than implying is that the individual is the property of the state and that therefore the state has a right to dictate that individuals behavior that is a philosophical difference that and I'm not willing to accept that by the way I think that individuals in this country have a right to make their own informed decisions about whether or not they wish to smoke or, age in other activities that might present some risk mr. Lightman your reaction to the report I have not read the report yet I was traveling on the day it was issue I've read news summaries of it I think the figure being used of 50 some billion dollars is probably a most conservative figure because in 1985 Congress did Issue a report that smoking was costing this nation somewhere between 65 billion in ninety billion dollars in direct health care costs lost productivity, an early morbidity representative for Tony Stark has concluded that smoking cost this nation ten million dollars an hour which is certainly significant and employers do pay for the health care costs of their employees and there is a lot of smoking-related disease in this country 390,000 people lose their lives every year from tobacco related illnesses let's put another issue on the table before we go to the phones mr. Lightman Senator Kennedy has introduced a bill called s 1880, III otherwise known as The Tobacco education and Control Act of 1990 what's in it and what do you think about it we are very pleased that Senator Kennedy and his labor and Human Resources committee or taking the leadership role that they are taking with this issue this would create a center for tobacco products education and control in the federal government estimates range somewhere between 50 billion and 100 billion dollars one of the things I like about the bill, the fact that the government will now get involved in counter advertising as you recall when tobacco companies advertised on television back in the 60s and 50s there was a law that came into being that required broadcasters to make the equal amount of time available to the anti-smoking groups to put out a pro health message we feel if this is done in print in newspapers and magazines we can Mock and ridicule, you'll these ads and drive the companies from print the same way we drove them off the airwaves mr. Merriman well I think it's very clear that this bill's premise is that Americans don't have any information about smoking and health I don't know how anyone could seriously make that argument at least with a straight face it's very clear that Americans are more aware of smoking and health issues than they know that we have to import oil to meet our energy needs as a matter of fact we learned through analysis, closest of public opinion data that more people are aware of the smoking and health issues and what the Surgeon General and others say about smoking then know who George Washington was I don't think it's credible for anyone to say or even believe that Americans don't have information about smoking and health they certainly do almost everything that is in this bill with a few exceptions is already covered in legislation that's already on the books, I think it's duplicative and wasteful and unnecessary you both follow Capitol Hill and before we go to the phone's let me ask you quickly do you expect this or any part of it to become law I have a hard time looking at a crystal ball really I can't give you an answer I don't think frankly that there are too many people in Congress however who really want to go through another battle on smoking issues mr. Lightman the battle has just begun with the airline smoking, van which we've recently won it may take a year or two or possibly three for this legislation to become a reality but we think it will be enacted just want to conclude by saying that most information that most people get on a daily basis comes to them through the form of these advertising images and the tobacco industry is spending two and a half billion dollars a year promoting the products and that's what people know about smoking Marlboro Etc, all of the messages all right let's go to the phones we've got half an hour to go we'll spend it all with your calls our guest wolterman of the tobacco Institute and are Enlightenment of citizens against tobacco smoke and the first call for them is from Irvine California go ahead please yes I'm curious to know the change in the movie industry I see a lot of movies I noticing that there's a gradual return to the smoking after on film and you know that in the 40s and 50s and 60s that was, is quite common and then it kind of went away now I'm seeing that I'm disappointed to see this in terms of shows like The Fabulous Baker Boys and Stella where the actors are starting to smoke again my question is is the tobacco industry a big fund supporter of the movie industry thank you mr. Merriman to the best of my knowledge no there have been literally thousands of films made in the last decade there have been occasions as I understand it when, backhoe companies have been approached by producers and asked to place their products in films and that has occurred on a very very few occasions the vast majority of cases however it's done without the approval consent or even knowledge of the tobacco companies I would disagree as an independent motion picture and producer and writer which is what I am by trade I'm aware of the fact that the industry the tobacco industry and specifically companies like, Philip Morris pay tens of thousands of dollars to have their products placed on the motion picture screen however if you look at the motion pictures that the caller just cited you'll find that their period pieces and in order to accurately reflect a situation from 1950 or even the 60s you will see some smoking however if you look at the genre of motion picture that is produced in 1990 or the late 80s you do find less smoking you also find the surgeon general's, morning appearing at the end of a recent James Bond movie because they did pay to have the brand promoted on the screen Fort Worth Texas you're on the air yeah I would like to make a comment I am a nun smoker my grandmother is 99 years old my grandfather is 100 years old they have both smoked all of their life now as I see it I do not think that anybody has the right to tell a, person they could smoke where or when and I am very much against these non-smokers as a surgeon general's warning now on cigarettes it does not say smoking causes cancer it's just quitting smoking make greatly reduce serious risk to your help so nobody can prove that smoking causes cancer or not thank you Aaron Lightman well the government has proved it in there more than 50,000 studies that, the eight tobacco use with disease disability and death and if the caller would read the other labels smoking does cause lung cancer and emphysema and it also causes birth defects you don't see the word birth defect written on the side of the pack because that was a political compromise made with the tobacco industry no one in their right mind today doubts anything about how harmful tobacco use is I would like to ask mr. Merriman for the record does, backhoe use cause cancer I think the caller was making an important point and that is that it's an individual's right to make a decision and I think that she also made the point very clearly perhaps clearer than I could that information about smoking issues contrary to what Aaron would like us to believe is certainly pervasive throughout Society I doubt if there's an individual in your audience tonight who can say that he or she has not heard of or does not know what the surgeon general's warning, the is and means therefore it seems to me it's an individual's decision about whether or not to smoke and the government cannot take that right from an individual what is the tobacco industry think though does smoking cause disease I don't know if it does or not Aaron and I think that anyone in the audience can make his or her own judgment about that Vernon New Jersey is next go ahead thank you you're on the air thank you, in go ahead hello I'd like to ask please if the moderator would make his first question back to mr. leichman because I feel that mr. Berryman answered and it's like man did not and that question was what is the proper role of the Federal Government in the matter of smoking exactly all right government government has the right and the obligation to protect the public health and tobacco smoke is harmful to non-smokers in places like The Airliner cabin that's why we, now have a federal law that takes effect February 25 Banning smoking on virtually every domestic flight in this country so if you're asking whether or not government should taken a stand or an issue the answer for me is certainly yes I would love to see a workplace smoking ban enacted by the federal government throughout this country that would take place in every state and local community so quite frankly I think the, the government has not gone far enough it is left this up to State and local governments and mr. Merriman represents an industry that is Rich and powerful and lobbies of very effectively at the state level and local level but it's funny that the anti-smoking groups are really winning this war we are enacting so many of these non smoker protection laws at the local level it's difficult to even keep track of the most recently Montgomery County Maryland has virtually banned smoking in the workplace, that takes effect in about 90 days San Diego you're on the air all right I can kind of see both sides of this issue I and I'm a nonsmoker and I enjoy going to a restaurant or flying on a plane or I don't have to be around cigarette smoke but at the same time I can I understand mr. Merriman's position about people making their own choices it gets tiring to see the federal government sticking their fingers in everything that everybody does you know if, we could have cars that were only going 55 miles an hour with Governors on them because the federal government doesn't think that we could take care of ourselves so there's so many ways that this could could go not only in smoking but you know I also am concerned about the number of jobs that are at stake as well as the individuals right all right thank you mr. Merriman well I think the caller makes a good point that there has to be a very logical Point Beyond which, government need not go and I think that we've demonstrated in this country that people can make their own decisions about things that might entail some risk like smoking you can't very well expect the government to ban the product although I know some people in the anti-smoking movements would prefer that but I know that as well I have confidence in the ability of adults in this country to make their own informed judgment and not to rely upon the government to a sensor, information whether it's commercial or otherwise or to try to make that decision for them I'm also concerned about the access that youth have to tobacco products does a 13 year old girl have enough information to make a choice whether or not she smokes and becomes addicted to tobacco use when there is not even anything on the label that says that the product is addictive now mr. Merriman contends that the, it is not addictive the surgeon general's report a couple years ago said it was I think the evidence is clear and overwhelming on that issue mr. Merriman represents an industry that has never admitted any harm whatsoever about tobacco and all he says is that let the buyer beware let the mature adult make the decision I'm concerned about the 4,000 children in this nation every day who make the decision to take up tobacco use Norfolk Virginia, you're on the air yeah go ahead please Norfolk Virginia and I'm a 55 year old man I've been spoken before I started first grade which put me about 5 years old and, at that time when I first started smoking a cost on the first drag, and then after I finished that cigarette I could smoke again and again again again and then throughout the years to cigarettes were pretty good back then and then the man put a filter on that he was trying to tell you something that he put some other attitudes in it, you know cart that is telling me something right there what's it tell you all right I found a medical library book not a dictionary it said this was copyrighted back in 1927 a medical library book and it said that tobacco was poisoned it's how the man treat the backer it's not hey cures it is hey treats it all right sir and, he just told some of it but all right think he just said the doctor Koop didn't tell the whole story he just told some of the things do you have a response mr. Merriman well I think former Surgeon General Coupe and the surgeons General who preceded him have told all of the story that I think Americans want to hear I think a lot of Americans believe that they've heard as much as they need to about smoking and health issues they want to make their own decisions not agree with her, but it's not appropriate for kids to smoke I don't think cigarettes ought to be sold to kids and I think as well that the tobacco industry has a pretty enviable near 30-year record of voluntary initiatives trying to avoid advertising and marketing directed at kids and also trying to work with retailers and others to make certain that cigarettes aren't sold two youngsters nobody's going to be perfect in this regard nothing like a perfect enforcement record could ever be a, accomplished but I think it's certainly worth giving it a good try and we've been doing it for a very long time, only in the bizarre world of the tobacco industry Can someone say that the companies are granting women for example with freedom and greater Independence when in fact it's hooking them on an addictive drug the most addictive drug known to man it is rather obvious that most people don't know that nicotine is a poison a drop of nicotine on your tongue will kill you and there are also pesticides and insecticides used, in the curing of tobacco that are highly toxic there was a batch of Winston cigarettes that unfortunately contained some of these residues and it was shipped to Japan Unfortunately they found the product contaminated before it got onto the shelves but what we're dealing with is a virtually unregulated industry that is about to come under much more government scrutiny Chelmsford Massachusetts thank you so much I thank you for these bad having this, on the air today I am never have smoked ever and I never thought I could ever be harmed by secondary smoke but I can hardly breathe now and I've never smoked I can't avoid being around the smoker because of what this gentleman is saying that they have their right to make their own decisions and that certainly is true however they don't have the right to make a decision to smoke in an area where there are non-smokers, and they have to recognize the fact that they're harming us desperately I have very bad lung problem I've been working for three years stupidly it's not through my own fault I have to help make a living and I have constantly been working towards getting a smoke-free environment and they keep putting me off and putting me off saying that they're going to do something about it I now have to work partly out of my home this the smoking has what you said is a poison, is absolutely correct I'm amazed at the amount of people who are calling you and don't recognize when they go into a mall for instance I cannot breathe air okay mayor thank you very much mr. Merriman well I think that one thing the caller was expressing is something that people who own and operate and manage businesses in this country deal with every day and that is what is the appropriate smoking policy for that business this is something again that the tobacco industry has helped, labor groups all over the country in an attempt to who come to an accommodation of smokers and non-smokers in their Workforce and their customers to try to decide what's an appropriate smoking policy a blanket policy isn't going to work for every kind of business but I think that most employers and most businesses in this country realize that smoking policies just a good part of doing business and the vast majority of them do have a policy on smoking owners and Proprietors of business do, don't really have a say in the kind of quality of water that comes through the tap we do have clean water standards and it is fairly certain that if you drink tap water in from any business in this country it's going to be clean we are now encouraging employers and owners and Proprietors of businesses to ban smoking in the workplace the problem of non-smokers being forced to breathe tobacco smoke should not be treated as a mere nuisance to be resolved by good manners courtesy and, strength it should be treated as a severe threat to Public Health requiring government action and we are seeing that government action in virtually every state in the Union and we're going to be seeing a lot more of it we've got 15 minutes to go as we're talking with representatives of the tobacco Institute and citizens against tobacco smoke for the remainder of that time and before we take the next call let me ask mr. Merriman and mr. Lightman there is a free speech issue here to what extent do you think, that if the tobacco Institute is prevails in Congress that it will be on constitutional grounds rather than some other grounds that really has to do with the issue of advertising of the product that is commercial speech as the Supreme Court has called it a number of Supreme Court decisions since 1976 have clearly and inexorably extended their interpretation of First Amendment, to commercial speech as long as what is being said is truthful and the product is legal the Supreme Court has said the government will have an extremely difficult time Banning that commercial speech that advertising there simply is is no getting around the fact that the First Amendment as the Supreme Court of the United States has interpreted it does in fact apply to commercial speech now it's not going to protect someone who wants to say that putting, we're so coated Timber on your head is going to grow hair because obviously that's not true but the court has said in a number of decisions involving other products and services that the First Amendment which involves commercial speech advertising does extend protection to advertisers and I think that's a very good reason why Congress has been very very leery of getting into any area which would ban advertising or restrict it from certain media the broadcast ban, advertising went into effect in 1971 that was about five years before The Supreme Court started issuing opinions on Commercial freedom of speech there have been opinion since then that have that have restricted commercial speech on casino gambling but that doesn't have anything to do with cigarette advertising since the cigarettes are sold in every state casino gambling is not legal in every state so I think that it's very clear that the high court has intended that first amendment protections be, it ended in as broad a measure as possible to commercial speech for legal products that is truthful you expect the Constitutional grounds to be strong on your behalf every hearing that's been held in Congress on this issue has really focused on the Constitutional aspects but the First Amendment means how far does it extend what do constitutional Scholars have to say about it and the clear impression I get is that when you get organizations like the American, civil liberties Union and the Washington Legal Foundation on each end of the political Spectrum supporting the right of tobacco companies to advertise then you've got a pretty full circle are Enlightenment the Constitutional issue is an interesting one quite frankly it is also a very narrow and quite boring but if you do look at the record from July 18 1986 and August 1 1986 the first series of hearings, ings and order a copy of the book from Congressman waxman's office you will see a fascinating discussion on exactly what the tobacco industry is doing with its advertising and marketing in the targeting of Youth the sophisticated high-powered advertising that really glamorizes smoking the tobacco industry is really not selling cigarettes as much as they are the very concept of smoking including luring unsuspecting women and children, to a highly addictive habit the question was do you believe that the Constitutional grounds are strong on behalf of the smoking or the tobacco Institute no they're not because commercial speech does not give the manufacturer the right to lie or deceive the public about a product or the health impact of the product okay San Bernardino California go ahead good afternoon good afternoon I come from a big family don't smoker but I believe it is none of the government's business to tell people how to run their life, life and if they supposed to print all the dangers of tobacco why don't they print also all the poison of like they're giving us in the food and that time milk with the bovine hormones which is very damaging to the health because everything I'm 67 and we never never had any key to dying of cancer like we have today and the heater not smokers all right I think we have the right to know all the person that we are getting on our fruits and vegetables my sister last year was for all guys, a few for my with a fainting spell certain block out everything and Africa to explain everything I told her you father you eating until it stopped in the fruit and boy has it get take garlic and take a lot of lemon juice and water and you better believe it she got well and because she went to the doctor and they convert nothing wrong with her okay ma'am thank you are like man what do you think of that parallel well I'm not sure the parallel is a sound when I think the most misperceived thing about the anti-smoking movement is, that people want to tell other people really how to live their lives what we're looking for is protection from tobacco smoke and we want to remove the access of tobacco products to Children cigarette vending machines is they are doing very successfully they're banning them all over the state of Minnesota now where children have access to them any kid can go into a restaurant and throw five or six quarters into one of these vending machines and get this highly addictive product and become hooked to it when you look at the, ception in the Distortion and the undermining of all the massive amount of medical evidence which proves the toxic case against cigarettes you have to look at the industry that is promoting this product I think mr. Merriman is practically admitted today that the tobacco industry does not admit that its products are harmful to anyone and that in and of itself says a lot welcome Aaron I'm just fascinated Aaron at your lack of ability to give people in this country credit for little common sense, if what you say is true than everyone in this country ought to be puffing away three packs a day obviously that doesn't happen people make their own decisions about smoking you're not mesmerised by every cigarette advertisement you see thankfully the percentage of youngsters smoking in recent years has been declining I think it's very clear that cigarette advertising appeals to people who smoke trying to get them to switch their brands or maintain their loyalty to the current brand and I do, I think that the anti-smoking movement really does itself Proud by promoting censorship harassment and sumptuously Taxation well we're not promoting me I'll go ahead please yeah I'm a former smoker I was wondering I've got a younger sister who's going to turn 15 next month and she's been smoking and I see all her friends smoking and the way I see it the only way to keep them from taking at this habit is to ban tobacco products and I was wondering our question is if we can win this War on Drugs, that is why couldn't we win a war on Tobacco well tobacco is a gateway drug and if we are serious about waging a War on Drugs we must start with tobacco I don't think your 15 year old sister is mature enough to make the decision that mr. Merriman gives her credit for being mature enough to make because every day in this nation 4,000 kids do take up this product and mr. Merriman knows that if they're not targeting children with their messages who are they targeting because, adults don't begin to smoke it is the children and the vulnerable youth who take up this product it's so like you are in to misrepresent what I've said at no time during the program have I said that a 15 year-old has the maturity or the judgment to make a decision about smoking I think it's very clear that adults have the right to make that judgment every state has laws which are admittedly difficult to enforce to try to keep kids from smoking but I don't think that, difficulty and enforcement is any reason to abandon the effort the tobacco industry doesn't want kids as customers we've made that very clear over the past 25 or 30 years we've tried to take voluntary initiatives to prevent that and I think it's also very clear that at the same time we believe that adults have the right to make that choice and I don't think that Aaron or his group or the federal government for that matter has any writer obligation responsibility to try to take that right away from others after this next, call I want to ask you both about tobacco subsidies because it came up in the previous segment and I think we owe it to our audience to get an answer from the people who are most likely to know but before that Richmond Kentucky is next go ahead please yes Richmond I'm a 31 year old male I've only worked in tobacco two years I'm a nonsmoker my friends that stoop to smoking smoke on the stoop outside and are happy with me about the decision I just like to ask both Advocates a question mr. Lichtman, I'm wondering does the taxpayer still pay substitute to the extent of an entire Year's interest on the wholesale market and to mr. Merriman are there any product for uses of tobacco such as hemp which can be used for making rope and textiles okay first mr. Lightman I am aware that to administer the tobacco price support program in this nation according to the tobacco industry is an estimated, added 12 to 15 million dollars a year just to administer the price supports now I can't tell you how much each farmer gets to support the product I do know this if you banned all of the price supports it would be the tobacco industry the six cigarette companies who would start growing the product and then the price would probably Skyrocket the decision is whether or not this nation is going, allow the commercial growing promotion and marketing of an addictive product that kills three hundred and ninety thousand people a year okay we're running out of time quickly mr. Merriman sounds to me are unlike you're promoting a ban on the product you've all you say is true that seems to be the logical endpoint of your argument let me say very clearly and briefly there's no such thing as a tobacco subsidy 12 to 15 million dollars aram's talking about Sin administrative cost, that cost would be there whether or not there was a tobacco program administered by the federal government quickly the question about a non-smoking use of tobacco the color suggested hemp for rope and that kind of thing do you know of any such use researchers have identified very high quality proteins in tobacco which can be extracted and used as food additives even higher quality than soy protein for example the process is expensive but it is one possible alternative use for tobacco league and quickly the question that came up in the last segment, was when was the last Congressional vote on the tobacco subsidy or support program or whatever you want to call it you call either within the last two to four years I believe there will be some Congressional consideration of not only Omnibus Farm legislation in the coming session but the last one program was couple years ago you think two to four years ago same I don't know I think the next big issue is the increase on the federal excise tax of tobacco products which less one of the next big battles is the our last call and, we need time to come A Washington go ahead please and please be brief yeah I like to know knowing that alcohol and tobacco are drugs why our government hasn't classified as drugs okay thank you welcome Merriman well I don't agree with the characterization that tobacco is a drug in the first place Congress in its wisdom has decided to retain most regulation of tobacco in and of itself tobacco is extremely highly regulated there's a now, but soup of federal agencies and also state and local governments that regulate tobacco and smoking in one way or another so certainly tobacco hasn't escaped regulation if that's the import of the impact of the caller's question Erin Lightman according to the National Institute on drug abuse nicotine is highly addictive we know that the average smoker smokes 30 cigarettes a day that's 50 to 60 thousand doses or hits of nicotine every year no other form of drug use occurs with such frequency irregularity and I think dr. David said in, the first part of the program 80% of the smokers say they want to quit and the new legislation that we now see Banning smoking on airplanes and in workplaces really gives smokers a chance to quit we've got about half a minute for each of you to say a word about where you are Walker Merriman well I think that very clearly with this, Airline smoking band coming up on Sunday anyone who's read the latest Department of Transportation report on are cabin quality shouldn't be concerned about environmental tobacco smoke in aircraft as one scientist put at the exposure to non-smokers is biologically insignificant and it's minimal I think it's legislation with lack of information I think Congress was stampeded by some anti-smoking activists who decided this was a good horse to ride and now they're making the best of it, Aaron Lightman half a minute well we are certainly undergoing some fundamental social changes about smoking I am not opposed to adults smoking as long as they don't smoke in public and as long as the toxic and harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke which number about 4,000 and are carcinogenic mutagenic and pharmacologically active don't harm innocent people whether it's in the workplace restaurants or The Airliner cabin we are, seeing history being made this was the most significant victory in the last couple of years over the tobacco industry and it will lead to other victories but we're not out telling Society how to live we just want to give smokers protection to breathe clean air we all share the public are thank you both Walker merryman of the tobacco Institute and Aaron Lightman of citizens against tobacco smoke appreciate your time, and so our audience thanks for watching have a good evening, that concludes this evening's calling programs a note that will bring you a special on the 25th anniversary of the assassination of Malcolm X and that will come up Saturday afternoon at about 4 p.m. eastern time after the short break oh look at foreign policy",0.8438949468367342,0.69165844,0.91283923,ghfk0146,,tobacco; cigarette;<a href='http://www.archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&mediatype=movies&collection=industry-archives'>Browse by keywords in UCSF industry videos</a>,"THE TI;C-SPAN; ""LIVE VIEWER CALL-IN PROGRAM",

ghhb0039,"and the winner by unanimous decision and still heavyweight champion of the world my boy and what a fight it was Lynn anytime you put two heavyweights like Marlborough and Winston against each other you have to expect the fight to go the full 12 rounds in case you just joined us I'm Sam Hendrix along with Lyn beazley wrapping up the fight between select full flavor and Marlboro it was a great fight, right Sam but it was a disappointing loss for the RJ our fighter when you analyze the fight the select full flavor fighter failed to impress the judges who are discriminating smokers select came on strong in the late rounds but it just wasn't enough to win the decision right now we're standing by in the select Fighters locker room to talk to team select about what they learn from the fight and how they're changing their strategy for the August 2nd rematch in Winston-Salem even though we didn't win tonight's fight we learned a lot about our strategy our, under and ourselves having field sales in our Corner really helped us make some positive changes in our strategy which paid off in the latter rounds of the fight you're right friend we introduced select as the new fighter from Winston he was designed to appeal to those judges who typically score in favor of Marlborough select came out fighting really hard in the earlier rounds we dazed Marlboro by stealing a point 59 share market and select scored high with judges who don't like base Winston select also fared well with females, those smokers ages 21 to 34 and smokers who prefer the Box style of fighter but early into the fight after the excitement of the introduction was over some smokers saw select is just another Winston in fact some smokers thought select was replacing Winston King, that told us we position select too closely to base Winston we confused smokers they weren't sure if select was a Marlboro look-alike or Winston a new trunks the early rounds taught us that our advertising promotion and packaging has to make select look like a new generation of fighter have a different style from all other Winston Fighters and deliver on smooth once we figured that out rounds 10 through 12 turned around select came out with a whole new look that scored well, select opened in the 10th with a flurry of combinations to the body a strong first quarter buy one get one free punch and advertising punch the challenge tomorrow Oberon smooth and a clear message that said selects not just another Winston just look at the scoring the extra points reflected clear gains there is no doubt we've got momentum and the potential to become a future Contender but we can't underestimate the champ Marlboros a fierce competitor and won't lay down it's clear Winston can't fight both, Marlborough and savings with current lineup savings has rapidly become a real Contender and Winston lights did not fare well on its bout with Marlboro Lights last year Winston lights lost over a SharePoint while Marlboro Lights gained more than three in the full price non-mental light segment the fact is Winston just doesn't have a fighter to compete in the whitetip Lites class until camel special lights hit the scene Marlboro Lights was the uncontested champ select light Springs real power to the fight he joins the, let contenders at a time when select full flavor has momentum field sales and marketing work together to dress him in a new contemporary package that's cream smooth the new product blend on both lights and full flavor delivers on smooth advertising and promotion not only shouts new and smooth it also announces we're going toe-to-toe against the champ if Marlboro Lights is your idea of smooth we challenged it and on top of that the introductory promotion plan have a buy one get, get one free and to worth it notes is unprecedented we don't plan to pull any punches in our August rematch with Marlborough well Sam there you have it team select feels the strategy shift late in the fight really establishes their full flavor fighter as new and different from base Winston it smooth message is clear and they see their real shot at the title coming from select lights do you think that'll really make a difference absolutely you saw in the late rounds that select full flavor when position correctly responds to promotion and you can tell from, the packaging advertising and promotion plan that team select has learned from their Marketplace experience and adjusted their strategy for lights the packaging just says different from base once it's so smooth the advertising shows the marble smooth Challenge and the promotion plan is unprecedented Glenn with the new product Blends I got a winner it could go all the way, ladies and gentlemen welcome to the main event of the night this fight will determine the heavyweight championship of the world in the blue Corner wearing blue trunks with white trim is the Challenger Winston select lights and in the Red Corner wearing gold trunks with black trim the reigning heavyweight champion of the world but overall lights the fight is scheduled for a full 12 rounds the standing eight count will be, in effect you cannot be Saved by the Bell well in we know the strategies of both corners for tonight's fight and it looks like this could turn out to be a real bra I have to say the select light spider looks very focused tonight I don't think I've ever seen a new fighter look so smooth there's no question Winston and RJ are are expecting a lot out of Select lights but there are Rumblings about whether tonight's fight may affect our Jr.'s current number one Contender camel special lights before, the fight we talked to camels team managers at Blackmore and John alligator we asked John if he thought tonight's fight with select lights was going to hurt camel special lights chances as a future Contender I don't think so if we're Smart in how we manage the two fighters look our generous goal is to knock out the champ so specialized and select lights must work as a team not against each other during the introduction of Select lights are gr can't afford to give up any of the gains, is that we've already made with the special lights introduction special lights must remain a number one Contender that means we need to maintain advertising and promotional presence behind special lights to sustain momentum Ed do you agree that's right John the field will have to manage each fighter to ensure both come out as Champions we're smart management select in special lights should appeal to different groups of Marlboro smokers select can take the head on product challenge while, lights leverages and broadens the appeal of the Joe Camel image the two approaches can each be very effective but to win this fight the field will need to ensure that both Fighters keep Landing punches on Marlboro thanks John and Ed for those comments let's go up to the ring now for round one there's the Bell select is out of the corner look at that smooth footwork he opens with a left cross of challenge advertising but catches the Marlborough fighter off guard marvelous stung by selects combination of 100, a soft pack and some light spots that should really score with the female judges this new select fighter is up for the challenge tonight the Marlborough fighter looks a bit dazed and is beginning to show his age just look at select lights measuring up his opponent with an Eagle Eye the question is can select lights finish off the tank but the buy one get one free and but packs and cartons okay there's the Bell ending round one the two fighters returned to their Corners well in the challenges new strategy seems to be affected this fight could be going the full 12 hours, rounds we've got to take a break but smokers stay tuned we'll be here for the duration ladies and gentlemen mr. Yancey Ford from what we've all just seen it looks like we have the makings of a really good fight on our hands and I'm just as anxious as you to throw some more hard punches at Marlboro I like to reinforce some key points on this introduction, we have moved up the plan launch of Select lights as you know Philip Morris recent moves with their Marlboro summer promotion have dramatically changed the face of the industry we believe that these events make now and even better time to capture Marlboro smokers who are in the store looking for promotion while it means more work for our sales team we firmly believe doing so will pay off against a vulnerable Marlborough Winston is losing shared his savings and, Marlboro our company cannot afford for this trend to continue select is the only way Winston can become a strong brand again base Winston products have low appeal to Marlboro smokers the select challenge program has proven that we can attract more over smokers when they try select but without select lights however the momentum behind this brand is limited and you should be very proud of your role in the select lights introduction it was your excellent, back and suggestions on select full flavor that led to critical changes in the Brand's look and strategy and enable the introduction to be accelerated as Lenin Sam explained our Jr has been underrepresented in the white tip lights category camel special lights has already demonstrated great appeal among those smokers but select lights is crucial for broadening our opportunity and boxing lingo it becomes a two in our 12, ooh punch that means we'll need sustained effort behind camel special lights we can't afford to lose the momentum you have built on special lights since its introduction in April camel special light should remain on P CDs and advertising and promotional presence should be maintained well that should be primary or secondary is your call its Position will depend on its performance and potential in that store you should pay particular attention to the guy, guidelines in your introductory books to ensure support of both camel special lights and select lights the success of these two Brands is critical in our fight against Marlboro that strategies are strong and unique yet complement each other with select taking Marlborough head-on with the smooth Challenge and special lights leveraging the Joe Camel image the two strategies should appeal to different groups of Marlborough smokers, thereby broadening and maximizing our Jr.'s opportunity, it's really quite simple we've got two tremendous opportunities to convince Marlboro smokers we've got a better product for them these brands are your top two priorities and I have every confidence you'll make them both successful, now it's time for you to jump into the ring and give Marlboro fight they'll never forget",0.8429599748,0.7362867,0.91175634,ghhb0039,,tobacco; cigarette;<a href='http://www.archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&mediatype=movies&collection=industry-archives'>Browse by keywords in UCSF industry videos</a>,SM 148 WINSTON SELECT LIGHTS SALES VIDEO (06-01-93) (930601) DUB 10-30-96 (961030).

ghxb0079,"this morning we would like to begin a process that we believe is long overdue we would like to bring some balance to the debate surrounding secondhand smoke and other issues concerning cigarettes in America, and would like to establish an open dialogue with members of the media and members of the public so that we can better understand both sides of this issue, during the past couple of years there have been a lot of misconceptions surrounding secondhand smoke including claims that exposure to secondhand smoke was actually more dangerous than active smoking but as dr. Collins will detail in just a minute, studies show that secondhand smoke is highly diluted and on average people are exposed to very small quantities of second-hand smoke, let's make no mistake about it the goal of the anti-smoking industry is to bring back Prohibition in the United States, when confronted they'll tell you they don't want prohibition but their actions belie their words, and if you don't believe that's the case just look it's how extreme some of these efforts are like trying to people prohibit people from smoking Outdoors, or for smoking in public parks smoking in their cars even smoking in their own homes, consider this the alcohol prohibition movement started with the anti-alcohol supporters claiming that their goal was simply temperance, I would like to make Reynolds tobacco's position very clear we are not saying that smokers should be free to light up wherever they want whenever they want without considering the wishes of others but we do believe that the 45 million American adults who choose to smoke should be and can be afforded reasonable accommodations, and we share the Public's overwhelming opposition to Prohibition, there are common-sense ways to work out the problems without turning 45 million Americans into Outlaws and social outcasts, we understand that some people find secondhand smoke annoying no two ways about it but we also know that most Americans prefer common courtesy and Common Sense not government mandate to solve any problems that might arise, we believe that it's very important that the American public understand both sides of this issue so that they can make informed choices, to that end today we are launching a public information campaign that opens the debate on a number of issues our first effort appeared this morning in a number of major dailies I'm sure many of you have seen it as this ad points out non-smokers are typically exposed to very small quantities of second-hand smoke, just what is secondhand smoke you must understand that secondhand smoke is not the same as mainstream smoke or sidestream smoke it is hundreds to thousands of times more diluted, just how much secondhand smoke are non-smokers exposed to the answer is very little put in plain English any material can be made dangerous if the dose is big enough, the concentrations measured in millionths of a gram per cubic meter the typical levels typically found the second-hand smoke represents such miniscule doses that it is scientifically implausible that they could result in meaningful toxicological activity, to summarize one the amounts are secondhand smoke that smokers are likely to be exposed to are vanishingly small and too as such they are unlikely to be biologically important or toxicological E meaningful finally 3 the reported association between secondhand smoke and lung cancer could easily be the result of confounding given that it is such a weak Association and given the strength of other risk factors such as, diet, thus any effort to ban smoking in all workplaces and public buildings is motivated not by sound objective science but by political considerations of what constitutes correct Behavior, the government should not make this decision for the private sector or for individual Americans, received a report has been out since January of 93 why are you launching this campaign now is it because it could bills and Congress which would ban smoking in public places is it local ordinances one of the propagator campaign I think there is enough this has been a time in the last few months of overwhelming opposition to our industry a number of attacks have been made on the industry I think you, really need to look no further than the proposal that the Department of Labor and OSHA put forward in the last few months or a few weeks which takes things to such an extreme Draconian measure that clearly while we have been vocal in their opposition to the epa's handling of this and indeed are a party in a lawsuit against the EPA which is still unresolved and our dialogue has continued with the EPA and with others we felt that just the example of Osha and and other, pieces of legislation that have been floated so so clearly went beyond the wishes of the American public well into the era of prohibition and well away from what American said they want which is let us resolve our differences as we have for the last 400 years",0.8640691331999999,0.727909,0.9128387,ghxb0079,,tobacco; cigarette;<a href='http://www.archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&mediatype=movies&collection=industry-archives'>Browse by keywords in UCSF industry videos</a>,R.J.

gjhb0039,"adorable aren't they hi I'm Barbara my husband Bill thinks I'm crazy pretty nice here but I just tell him oh well the world's a crazy place and you know it's never crazier than when you were smoker take the other day I was taking a smoke break at work standing outside of course, my office building I was on the street when suddenly out of nowhere this this man runs up to me and says no smoking near that building I was shocked I mean there was two million cubic feet of air out there now I'm no radical but enough is enough I'm a smoker I like smoking I'm getting just a tad tired of people who want to make my choice their choice, it's almost like smoking has become a pain these days instead of a pleasure, but you know there is a way we smokers can free ourselves to enjoy the things we like about smoking it's this Eclipse by advantage in regular and menthol, first thing you'll notice about Eclipse you get a great taste nice draw and full-bodied satisfying smoke, but Bingo the smoke disappears about as fast as you can say thank you for not smoking and there's almost no smoke at the lid end added all of them what do you get an incredible new cigarette with super taste and nearly 90% less secondhand smoke to write on the back 90 percent that's a nice number especially when you're sharing life's journey with a nonsmoker like my husband Bill oh and check this out Eclipse leaves your curtains walls windows, does-- even your teeth a lot cleaner than other cigarettes observe, you know I've just redecorated and now with the clips is practically nothing to stay in these Priceless Treasures it's wild who would think that a cigarette could let us cut down on secondhand smoke without cutting down on satisfaction and guess what it's not just smokers like us who are crazy about it clipped people who don't smoke are raving about it too like Bill, now when we're together all that lingers in the air is my witty conversation but seriously that's what's so fabulous about eclipses there's almost no secondhand smoke almost no smoke from the live in practically no staining no lingering odor and no ashes you heard right no ashes because Eclipse doesn't burn down as we'll talk about later so now I don't need an ashtray every two feet anymore, what to do with all those extra ashtrays, stunning isn't it and now bill says all I smell like is my perfume a simple yet intriguing blend of Jasmine and free-range wildflowers now I ask you which would you rather have in your house this or this an ashtray of finished Eclipse yep that's what they look like after you've smoked them instant clean my favorite kind not that I don't underst grubbing dirty ashtrays but somehow I'll learn to do without it, before we go one step further I gotta show you this okay you already know because it has no ashes because it doesn't burn down as I mentioned so what's this Eclipse can lie flat on the table without leaving any burn marks so if your cigarette accidentally falls out of the ashtray it's less likely to burn your table carpet or your clothes well that's good news for shirts slacks sofas and car seats All Over America hmm, one thing to remember though Well there's almost no smoke at the lid and the tip is still hot so you be careful guys how does it Clips do all this let me tell you I wondered myself but actually it's simple let's go to the videotape from RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company the folks who created eclipse eclipse primarily Heats tobacco instead of burning it that's the basis for its many benefits yet it's made much like any other cigarette with a special difference at it made from high Purity carbon this tip is wrapped in, an insulating heat barrier that keeps the tobacco roll from burning down the rest of eclipse is just like other cigarettes a blend of fine tobacco followed by a regular cigarette filter, but how it's made how does it work r.j. Reynolds as you smoke your eclipse the heat barrier keeps the tobacco roll from burning down inside the cigarette instead when you draw warm air passes over the tobacco getting a just hot enough to create a full-bodied smoke that carries the flavor of the tobacco with it let's put it in English the way it flips works is something like making coffee when you pour the hot water all the flavors released, on the grounds, the ground is still there when you finish but all the flavors gone so yet tough them when you're done the guys don't trust your clip still the tips cooldown mention two clips taste rich and full-bodied but is super low in tar and nicotine no well let's hear all about it from the folks at r.j. Reynolds themselves, based on Government testing methods full flavor cigarette Styles range between 15 and 20 milligrams of tar light Styles between 6 and 14 and ultralights between 1 and 5 mg but Eclipse which primarily Heats rather than Burns tobacco is 3 milligrams in its full flavor style and to in its mild style for nicotine full flavor cigarettes typically range between point eight and one point seven milligrams of nicotine lights range between, .6 and .9 and ultralights range between point 1 and point five but eclipses nicotine level is just point to mg in its full flavor and point one and it's mild style and that's our math lesson for today seriously here's the bottom line Eclipse taste great is ultra low and tar and nicotine the smoke disappears super fast and there's a huge reduction in secondhand smoke why how it's because eclipse, poke is different from other cigarettes smoke particles from other cigarettes are about twenty percent water and glycerin put Eclipse Smoke is the reverse about 80% water and Glycerine glycerine is something found in all cigarette smoke as well as many food products and baked goods the smoke is, no sir there's almost no smoke off the lid and so no wonder there's so little secondhand smoke but is there anything in the Smoke of an eclipse that isn't in other cigarettes nope just more water and glycerin that's why all I smell are the flowers and why clip smoked a super smooth and just appear super fast just like I used to have two whenever I live cigarette, of course the real deal is Eclipse is a little different it first oh yes it is a real cigarette it's a great-tasting real cigarette it's not a cigarette alternative or any of that kind of stuff but you do sort of have to get used to it in the beginning but for me that's all part of discovering something so new and wonderful and all right then let's give it a whirl first and foremost we need a good strong flame when you light it can't use a car lighter you need a direct flame and you need to take an extra Puff, R2 when you light it that's because you lighting the carbon tip not the tobacco, now you already know Eclipse has no ashes because it doesn't burn down like your cigarette does that mean Eclipse doesn't last as long no way eclipse last just as long as my old cigarette about six or seven minutes I know I timed, another thing I discovered with the clips the best flavor comes from regular gentle pops now if you let it sit for a while the tip make all down but not to worry and extra Puffs will get it going again and when you start getting less smoke and The Taste gets weaker that's how you know your Clips is just about done, there's no question about it Eclipse really is a whole new world for us smokers now some of the great things like no ashes he discover right away others we appreciate after a while like one day maybe you take out your favorite sweater for me it's the one I was wearing when Bill proposed and guess what no cigarette odor or you walk into the house and it smells clean and fresh or you in your, are smoking a clips and you realize wow I'm smoking with the windows up I didn't even notice, here's another thing you'll discover the freedom you have when you smoke an eclipse so now I can tend to My Little Darlings without being tied to an ashtray but you know you really won't see how great it flips can be if you keep smoking your old brand so hang with the clips exclusively for a week or so and you'll see the difference, would I Barbara steer you wrong but you don't have to take my word for it listen to this okay when I first took the eclipse home I said you are not going to believe this cigarette well this is what I wanted this is exactly what I was hoping for there was just no smoke lingering in the air it was just unbelievable I took Eclipse to work and I took it down to our smokers room and the, smokers in the room were amazed with the clutch like it's know my wife's perfume or whatever she might be cooking at night I don't see you having to paint once a year the inside of your house because it's getting yellow to me is a reduction of the tar and nicotine in the cigarette is by far one of the best reasons it's more enjoyable than a regular cigarette that's the honest truth when I smoked a clipped it makes, me feel free to enjoy my cigarette without offending the non-smokers I would say would definitely be one of the only Innovative cigarettes I've ever heard of well that's the story about an incredible new cigarette called eclipse and incredible new cigarette that gives you all the pleasure of smoking without all the second-hand smoke, there's no lingering odor almost no stains no ashes and low low tar and nicotine all in a full-bodied smoke with super taste who knows with the clips maybe marriages All Over America will get better maybe it'll be the dawn of a new day of the harmony across this great land maybe chocolate will fit in your lies okay so that was a little overboard truth is it will always be, people out there who won't like that cigarette in your hand period but for the people you like the people you want to be around for you eclipse is a real step forward well I could go on and on but I don't have to aren't you lucky because you've got a fact-filled brochure that came with this video it talks about eclipses in more detail and answers the most commonly asked questions check it out it's short and informative like mate well it's time to say adios just when you thought, thought you couldn't get enough of me but hey you can always call the folks at r.j. Reynolds whenever you want just pick up a phone when you have questions or just want to share your thoughts about how great Eclipse really is the call is free so give them a shout out, and hey tell them Barbara sent you they just love me down there surgeon general's warning smoking causes lung cancer heart disease and vizima and they complicate pregnancy",0.8360605737142858,0.6782195,0.9128392,gjhb0039,,tobacco; cigarette;<a href='http://www.archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&mediatype=movies&collection=industry-archives'>Browse by keywords in UCSF industry videos</a>,ECLIPSE A WHOLE NEW WORLD FOR SMOKERS.

gkdv0183,"this is the history of the OSHA proposed smoking ban the battle lines were drawn when the regulation was proposed in 1994 the fight is still going on today, on April 5th 1994 the Department of Labor's occupational safety and health administration OSHA proposed a virtual Nationwide ban on smoking in all indoor workplaces put simply the rule says people can't smoke where they work or work where they smoke ironically OSHA admits that 85 to 90% of American workplace has already have a smoking policy in place given that acknowledgement many business owners managers and a, Association Representatives have questioned OSHA's rationale in proposing this rule a workplace under OSHA's indoor air quality standard requires all indoor work spaces from home offices to restaurants bars hotels motels casinos bingo halls bowling alleys and manufacturing plants to have special smoking rooms under negative pressure and separately exhausted to the outside, the cost of building such rooms is estimated to be about seventy thousand dollars which is more than most businesses can afford not to mention more than most small businesses make in a year the rule is costly impractical and unnecessary it would force many businesses to ban smoking and run the risk of losing customers in response to its proposal OSHA received over 110,000 comments from individuals, the organization's business owners and employees the overwhelming majority criticized OSHA's proposed standard on September 20th 1994 OSHA open public hearings on the smoking ban proposal for address during the first two days of the hearings the public including attorneys representing the tobacco industry question do--she officials on the smoking bans purpose its economic impact and it's practical applications the officials responsible, made it clear that they had failed to consider important elements of the regulation let's suppose that my Law Firm decides to implement the standard goes into effect and has a law firm decides to have a designated smoking area and I go in there and smoke a cigarette can I read a work-related memorandum know I think that there are a number of scenarios that will come up during the course of these hearings including some that you're starting to bring up now, now and it's a bun you to bring up their number scenarios that are raised intriguing interesting important questions that we may not have thoroughly thought through from September 1994 through March 1995 over 400 individuals representing businesses trade associations and other organizations testified at the hearings against the smoking ban we believe strongly that if in fact this regulation is adopted that people will stop, coming into our taverns they will in a word stay home enjoyed tobacco products in their home and consume other forms of entertainment in their home and this is the primary motivation for us coming before you today we're talking about the loss of employment that's what we're talking about that's why we're concerned and very much concerned about the proposed OSHA ruling this proposed ruling would seriously impact my, my business my livelihood and my right to do business have been active this regulation would not only restrict the freedom of 50 million Americans who choose to smoke, it also would chip away at the freedom of every US citizen by making it illegal to discriminate against one group of people because of a lifestyle Choice the regulation would move our nation away from acceptance of diversity and back to the days of intolerance and prohibition the reason that I'm here to today is myself and our employees are both opposed to this, ban on smoking, I feel that it would hurt my business great Lakeman playing people and I'm paying a lot of taxes and I honestly think this might totally ruin my business the simple fact of the matter is the OSHA regulation is unnecessary most workplaces in the United States already have established formal smoking policies proving that employers and employees are perfectly capable of addressing the smoking issue or any workplace issue, on their own boils down to two fundamental issues it's costly and as such it will hurt business across the board the proposals impact will be far-reaching but members of the hospitality industry are especially concerned according to a study conducted for the National Restaurant Association the restaurant industry will suffer a 6.5 percent loss in sales with 18 point two billion dollars of lost sales Nationwide which could result in thousands of lost jobs, there are a lot of reasons why restaurants go out of business but government mandates and the smoking issue which is very controversial is one that we're very concerned about is that were these proposals to be put into effect they would cause some closures there they would cause some decrease in jobs another study conducted by the San Francisco hotel association shows the effects of the smoking ban on the u.s. tourism industry a loss of 3.9 billion dollars in spending by Foreign visitors, visitors to the United States a 6.8 percent decrease in foreign travel expenditures and job losses estimated at 62,000 my experience my gut feeling tells me that this proposal will be a disaster I hope that OSHA and it's officials will look into the human side of this poorly thought-out regulation and realize that the hospitality industry must satisfy all patrons it all it's paid, and they'll be out of business after the hearing is concluded on March 13th 1995 post-hearing public comment period began during this time business owners managers and other interested parties continue to speak out against the regulation also during this period the Congressional research service CRS issued a report which called into question the basis for OSHA's proposed rule that would effectively ban smoking several concerned, has cited the CRS report in criticizing OSHA's efforts to ban smoking with their CRS report we have written to OSHA to say Open Rio from the hearings and to look again at the report of the Congressional research service since their integrity is so high above reproach we feel that this is something that substantial waited what we said early on Vindicated us in our decision in objecting to what ocean was going to do on February, ninth Nineteen Ninety Six the final date of the post earring comment period the national licensed beverage Association hosted a press conference in Washington where more business owners and Community leaders spoke out against OSHA smoking ban unfortunately the OSHA indoor air quality proposed rules show that the federal government has forgotten the lessons of provision and that they have learned very little about the economics of small business we strongly believe OSHA should drop their current, proposals and focus on alternative Solutions if OSHA takes away 75% of my customer base they are in essence taking my business away from me my only means of livelihood these regulations would bankrupt me and tens of thousands of other small businesses like me across the country we're very opposed to it in Nevada because again it interferes with our relationship with our customer and our employee from the beginning of the hearings through the, the comment period OSHA was presented with 16,000 pages of recorded testimony tens of thousands of written comments and volumes of other submissions never before in the agency's history has a proposal generated public response of this magnitude now the OSHA officials are examining This Record when the evaluation is complete they could either propose a revised rule reopen the record or issue a final regulation whichever course they, I choose their decision should reflect the record and a significant negative economic implications of a one-size-fits-all approach opposition to the regulation has been loud and clear and although the current public comment period has ended the battle to keep government out of business and out of the lives of individuals is not over yet",0.8559821300000001,0.73392755,0.91283846,gkdv0183,,tobacco; cigarette;  <a

gkhv0183,"this is where the land stretches out forever, and were some men do what others only dream of, because this is Marlboro Country and this is Marlboro story, back in 1954 90% of the cigarettes sold in the US were filterless and Marlboro was being sold as a woman cigarette with Ivory or red beauty tips, but Philip Morris saw an opportunity to reposition Marlboro and Market filter cigarettes two men so Marlborough was reformulated with the court tip filter a stronger more flavorful blend and wrapped in a new revolutionary package the flip top box was a bold masculine eye-catching red and white design the famous Red Roof now known around the world that same year Philip Morris also chose a new advertising, agency for Marlboro here's how Joe Coleman former chairman of Philip Morris recalls that first meeting and Roger gray and then the advertising director myself got on the 20th century limited that's how we travel in those days no airplane service the 1954 we got to Chicago checked in the hotel went over the Leo Burnett and told him what our problem was he sat there mr. Leo Burnett was a formidable person by himself he was a very serious, very thoughtful personality that knew exactly how he felt about things is very positive and we tell them what we wanted to do he said were you mean you want to take a formerly woman cigarette like Marlboro there was sort of a premium price had a rose tip and advertised as mild as may you want to make it a no male cigarettes that's quite a job, here's how the late Leo Burnett described his agency's first work session what's the most masculine symbol you can think of and her off the top of his head one of these writers spoke up and said a cowboy, and there it hasn't been this quite a while but this is one of the greatest things I've ever seen I just every Instinct I had told me that this was this was it you see although the very first ad showed a cowboy the campaign featured many different kinds of men they were strong and masculine worked at interesting action-filled occupations and more tattoos that hinted at romantic pasts, this new strategy began to work and work well sales volume nearly tripled within just one year by 1962 the decision was made that rather than a variety of strong masculine types a singular Marlboro Man would work even better, the solution was found in the American Cowboy, the next year he was given a home Marlboro Country here's how the evolution of that campaign was described by a former president of Philip Morris Jack Landry Marlboro advertising from its Inception in 1954 has consistently developed and grown from our original concept, this was the next refinement in our advertising to put the cowboy in his world today's West and when we did he became a more believable symbol of masculinity the rugged dramatic beauty of his world allowed him to also become a more visual symbol and in visual terms he was at his strongest you campaign have been as single-minded and purpose and as unique and fresh in execution, we were the first to use real men in our advertising instead of professional model type this changed the whole advertising business not just cigarette advertising the non model model became fashionable, as the Marlboro Country campaign continued it gained even more momentum throughout the 60s becoming by 1972 the best-selling cigarette in the world Marlboro is now marketed in over 150 Nations and territories a success aided by the campaign's ability to travel well across borders domestically and abroad the campaign's ability to take advantage of changing tastes and, Odes among smokers has also played a key role in the Brand's future successes when we came into a period of over where we sort of stabilized on a certain level because people with become very interested in tar nicotine content cigarette one of the thoughts was that we ought to talk about the tar and nicotine content of Bravo sat down and said Jack we got to do something about the we got to bring out a Marlboro line extension of Marlborough miles and what I recommend he said Joe would you, mind if you go to Marlboro Lights with the introduction of Marlboro Lights Philip Morris expanded the definition of the Brand's character by using familiar similar themes the roof the Cowboy and the country over the years Marlboro continued to use LINE extensions to support an address changes in consumers tastes and attitudes creating no news for the brand and fueling its growth, in the late 80s however the market began changing leading to price promotion from many brand name products across many categories and marburo began to see heightened competition from the Discount Cigarette segment, Marlboro responded to these pressures by adjusting the value equation while keeping the Marlboro Country campaign going strong Marlboro also took pricing actions while at the same time leading A Renewed investment in retail visibility and mega consumer promotions, Marlboro racing proved that the Marlboro concept successfully extended in other equities consistent with the theme of heroic masculinity but in 1990 marburo took racing to new heights when marburo Team Penske began competing on the IndyCar track creating excitement for the brand by becoming one of the most recognized and successful teams in the series, next came the launch of the single biggest consumer promotion of all time the Marlboro Adventure team, millions of smokers entered a contest to join the adventure team in a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Marlboro Country and an overwhelming number of consumers save miles from Pax to get free Marlboro Adventure team gear, the success of this program led to another the Marlboro Country Store which again gave consumers the opportunity to own a piece of Marlboro Country by collecting miles to get more gear in 1996 Marlboro will introduce to Consumers the most exciting promotion yet the Marlboro Unlimited it's a third of a mile long state-of-the-art train built, exclusively for Marlboro smokers 2000 winners and their guests will spend five days and nights on board with scheduled stops to take on everything a land Without Limits as to offer and right along with it Marlboro will roll out an entire new line of gear, I look at Marlboro share the US market shows that the result of this ongoing value-added strategy has been tremendous and has left Marlboro well positioned for growth, and to look at total worldwide sales shows that Marlboro sales have steadily increased year after year and now exceed 398 billion and volume continues to grow, this then is the Marlboro story a single idea born in 1954 then evolved and expanded into the most successful and recognizable campaign in history an idea that's kept the brand alive vital and aspirational while remaining compelling and relevant through the years like the land that stretches as far as you can see, Marlboro continues to do what others only dream of",0.8683989621428573,0.738274,0.91283834,gkhv0183,,tobacco; cigarette;  <a

glhb0039,"from New York Forrest Sawyer over the past several months day one has reported on the tobacco industry and the health effects of cigarette smoking including a report on the manipulation of levels of nicotine in cigarettes the Food and Drug Administration has suggested it may be necessary to regulate cigarettes as a drug and Congress has begun hearings to debate the issue, now there is an extraordinary new development in the fight over cigarettes an unparalleled opportunity to examine the inner thoughts of one member of the tobacco industry documents have surfaced thousands of pages from a cigarette company called Brown & Williamson and its parent company the British American tobacco company called v80 are the makers of Viceroy cool and Raleigh Cigarettes the documents are internal Communications dating all the way back to the 1950s and they show how much the company's, about the harmful effects of cigarettes and how they responded to the growing Health crisis these documents may be the most significant disclosure of internal tobacco industry documents in the last 50 years how did the tobacco industry for all these years since people knew smoking caused lung cancer how did they survive how did they beat back the political pressures that were brought against them how did they intimidate the Health Community how did they keep the Health Community from taking meaningful action to control the Lynn to me, it's a fascinating story cigarettes, this Story begins in the 1950s when America was booming and cigarettes were an integral part of life the ads were everywhere and smoking meant fun but even back then they were concerns that smoking could be linked to cancer and the tobacco companies made a dramatic move to ease the Public's concerns issuing what they called a Frank statement that said we accept an interest in people's Health as, a basic responsibility but this was a sensitive subject the documents show that by 1957 some baat researchers were using the codename Zephyr apparently a reference to cancer one document repeatedly used the codename noting the idea has arisen that there is a causal relationship between Zephyr and tobacco smoking the documents do not explain whether code name was used in the first place, this is a way to hide this from yourself if you can make a game of it and say Zephyr is alleged to be caused by smoking and these dr. John Slade is an anti-smoking Advocate who studies the effects of smoking it's a little more comfortable perhaps to be talking about that in sort of play language than to be talking about cancer, in Congressional hearings just this past April Tobacco Company Executives continued to express cautions when asked about the findings of outside medical researchers this was one view they agree that smoking causes lung cancer do you agree it may do you know whether it does I do not know the documents raised questions about the public pronouncements of tobacco company Executives in 1962 v80 executive ad McCormick told a meeting of researchers from four continents quote, you were in much to responsible opposition to get up and say I accept that the product which we and our competitors are putting on the market gives you lung cancer whatever you might think privately it brings into serious question every statement they have made about addiction and health over the last 30 years attorney Matthew Myers who has been shown the documents represents a coalition of anti-smoking groups they should have told them the truth they should have told them what they knew by 1960, on it appears some Brown & Williamson researchers were debating how to deal with emerging evidence of a relationship between Cancer and tobacco a memo quoting the company's research director says scientists with whom I talked were unanimous in their opinion that smoke is weekly carcinogenic under certain conditions another document refers to animal studies showing that in sufficient doses tobacco condensate acts as a carcinogen the documents show that some Executives did argue, you for research that would lead to safer cigarettes even forming a less hazardous cigarettes committee they lost the debate and the safer cigarette was abandoned dr. Dietrich Hoffman a tobacco scientist at the American Health Foundation Samoans it would have fought some less harmful to you it less toxic see at on the market they would have admitted such a secret as toxic as carcinogenic it was also considerable research on the effects of nicotine, substance that is causing so much controversy today there were studies codenamed Mad Hatter and hippo and there was some plain talk about addiction in 1963 Addison yeaman general counsel at Brown & Williamson wrote We are then in the business of selling nicotine an addictive drug effective in the release of stress mechanisms to researchers wrote that same year unlike other dopings such as morphine the demand for increasing dose levels is relatively slow for nicotine, teen they also wrote in a chronic smoker the normal equilibrium can be maintained only by continuous nicotine intake this unconscious desire explains the addiction of the individual to nicotine, they're open acceptance of the fact that it was addicting, indicates to me that that they looked on that as a desirable property as something that helped keep their customers buying product the relaxing affects the stimulating effects the weight loss effects were seen as advantages that could be balanced against the disease causing effects yes it causes lung cancer but it also helps you control your weight, by the 1970s the tobacco industry had responded to Growing public concerns about smoking by offering a new kind of cigarette one low in tar and nicotine but early research suggested a cigarette would not really reduce nicotine intake the documents refer to a study which says the smoker adjusts his pattern to deliver his own nicotine requirements in other words he keeps smoking until his desire for nicotine is satisfied the documents also show strategies for dealing with, Ali damaging information research was to be done by an outside organization the council for tobacco research a 1978 memorandum says it is better to have someone else doing the research quote which if it goes wrong can become the smoking pistol in a lawsuit a 1979 memo recommends placing potentially damaging research under attorney-client privilege so anyone suing the company could not have access to it a full 40 years, after the tobacco companies issued their Frank statement to the American people Executives continue to hold a position that is now disputed by almost the entire scientific Community I believe nicotine is not addictive, I believe that nicotine is not addictive I believe nicotine is not addictive we now have 40 Years of evidence of cover-up of the assembling of a refusal to confront the major problems their products cause the Dogma continues the pretense continues that smoking isn't a cause of disease, Brown & Williamson has said it believes documents similar to the ones obtained by day one we're stolen from its law firms offices in violation of attorney-client privilege the papers do appear to be widely distributed now other news organizations have quoted from similar documents the house subcommittee on health and the environment has received a set and day one obtained its documents from a university Professor who told us he received an unsolicited Anonymous package filled with the papers legal wrangling is already begun the house subcommittee wants, it's brown and Williamson to testify at a hearing and the company says it is obtained a court order compelling various news organizations and even the subcommittee itself to show them the documents they've received late this afternoon Brown & Williamson sent us a news release saying that today it had made public quote studies that correct erroneous reports about nicotine research attributed to the company and that quote do not conclude that nicotine is addicting we should point out that we have not seen those studies Brown & Williamson is, rise to Brennan Dawson at the tobacco Institute to speak on its behalf and she is with us live in our Washington Bureau Miss Dawson you see how Fascinating People find these documents to be are there any circumstances in which Brown & Williamson would consider simply releasing them for public scrutiny well in fact what Brown & Williamson did today in which you just referred to is they at release the actual studies that seem to be being talked about in media reports what they don't know and what they've had to reluctantly go to court to try to find out is what, comments are being sent through the mail me what documents were stolen are they in fact company documents this is exactly the kind of problem that that the whole tobacco industry is faced with right now it's faced with the situation that is full of innuendo that's full of charges being selectively pulled out and then spread widely and what we're asking for is a Level Playing Field in this case Brown & Williamson asking mr. Waxman and the subcommittee let's just take a look at what documents you want us to answer questions about in the, time here are the actual studies that's people seem to be talking about that in fact do not conclude that nicotine is addicting of course what your critics are concerned about is you might be selectively releasing certain kinds of materials and there are these documents that are already out in the public Arena so the question is would Brown & Williamson consider allowing those documents then to go to public scrutiny well that's a decision that Brown & Williamson in conjunction with a court order prohibiting them to do just that we'll have to decide but in the meantime, isn't it only fair that critics of the industry again selecting portions of documents that people don't know where they came from so they can't even authenticate them should be able to review them in order to respond all right you want to look at what the doctor time the tobacco industry today Brown & Williamson releasing the original studies of several weeks ago the manufacturers joining to release the list of ingredients in cigarettes on a voluntary basis I mean this is the kind of information that we believe should continue to be forthcoming but these, these I'm sorry that I have some speculation I'm very sorry about the time I thank you very much for joining us Branden Dawson with the tobacco Institute Henry Waxman is the congressman with the house subcommittee on health and the environment sir put these documents in perspective are they important to you I think what we've got to put in perspective is the fact that the tobacco industry has operated in secret for decades and the public and the Congress have been kept from the information about what they have known about the health impacts of, of cigarettes and the nicotine Addiction in smoking it seems to me that our job is to be responsible to the public to get this information we're going to do it in a fair way we're going to do it in a responsible manner but I don't think the tobacco industry ought to ask for special treatment we're going to give them fair treatment well what they are saying is perhaps you're not being fair perhaps these documents were actually stolen from their law offices and that they are under attorney-client privilege and they only have asked the right to be able to review whether these, documented where in fact purloined we've heard from Brown & Williamson's attorney and they asked for a delay on the hearing we had scheduled for tomorrow we've given them that delay we've also told them that we're not going to question them on any documents except those which they give to the subcommittee and of they have promised us documents and we're yet to receive them we're going to question them about news reports which I think they ought to have an opportunity to be able to respond to and I think a congressional form is an appropriate place for them, to tell us to put things into context and to get us to understand what is being said that isn't accurate we are told that you have been handed a court order from a Kentucky judge who says that you should turn over those documents so that Brown & Williamson can review them and determine if they were stolen will you comply you know the tobacco industry can hire the best lawyers the bets public relations people they have a high economic interest in trying to keep the public from knowing the truth about a cigarette smoking, going to be fair to them but we're not going to be intimidated by them either Congressman the question of course is whether you'll let them look at them well we're talking to our house counsel to see whether that's an appropriate action for us to take and they've told us that it would be an extraordinary action to have them go through the files of a subcommittee of the Congress of the United States wall and investigation is going on we won't ask them questions about any documents at the hearing we have scheduled except those, is which they give to us and those that have been reported on in the public domain and I think they ought to have a chance to give their side of the story and we will give them that opportunity there is so much fighting going on over these documents and there's certain to be legal wrangling going on in the future why are these papers so important, you know the news reports about these papers indicate that perhaps the tobacco industry has known for a long time information that they deny even to today about the health impacts of cigarette smoking and the addiction from the nicotine in smoking I think we've got to find out what they have known and get that information out to the public and not let them hide all this information as they've been able to do for decades, they've been able to obfuscate Miss Dawson very quickly if you would your response well first of all the studies again that have been widely speculated upon in the media were made public today so I hope that mr. Waxman has an opportunity to review them and I hope he provides the companies an opportunity to review those documents that have been stolen that may not be there as before he asked them to be questioned Miss Dawson and Congressman Waxman I thank you both very much for joining us will be following the story and we will be right back, still to come on day one she defied her own son",0.8598093067647058,0.70612377,0.9128394,glhb0039,,tobacco; cigarette;<a href='http://www.archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&mediatype=movies&collection=industry-archives'>Browse by keywords in UCSF industry videos</a>,"DAY ONE - BAT MAY 16, 1994 (940516) - ABC - 8:00 PM 0144-94.

glpj0015,"adorable aren't they hi I'm Barbara my husband Bill thinks I'm crazy putting these here but I just tell him oh well the world's a crazy place and you know it's never crazier than when you were smoker take the other day I was taking a smoke break at work standing outside of course my, office building I was on the street when suddenly out of nowhere this this man runs up to me and says I mean there was two million cubic feet of air up there now I'm no radical but enough is enough I'm a smoker I like smoking and I'm getting just a tad tired of people who want to make my choice their choice it's almost like smokings become, paying these days instead of a pleasure, but you know there is a way we smokers can free ourselves to enjoy the things we like about smoking, it's this Eclipse by Vantage in regular and menthol, first thing you'll notice about eclipses you get a great taste nice draw and full-bodied satisfying smoke but Bingo the smoke disappears about as fast as you can say thank you for not smoking and there's almost no smoke at the lid end add it all up and what do you get an incredible new cigarette with super taste and 90% less secondhand smoke it's right on the back 90% less secondhand smoke, a nice number especially when you're sharing life's journey with a nonsmoker like my husband Bill oh and check this out Eclipse leaves your curtains walls Windows even your teeth a lot cleaner than other cigarettes observe, you know I've just redecorated and now with the clips is practically nothing to stain these Priceless Treasures, it's wild who would think that a cigarette could let us cut down on secondhand smoke without cutting down on satisfaction and guess what it's not just smokers like us who are crazy about eclipses people who don't smoke are raving about it too like Bill, now when we're together all that lingers in the air is my witty conversation but seriously that's what's so fabulous about eclipses there's almost no secondhand smoke almost no smoke from the lid end practically no staining no lingering odor and no ashes you heard right no ashes because Eclipse doesn't burn down as we'll talk about later so now I don't need an ashtray every two feet anymore, what to do with all those extra ashtrays, stunning isn't it and now bill says all I smell like is my perfume a simple yet intriguing blend of Jasmine and free-range wildflowers now I ask you which would you rather have in your house this or this an ashtray of finished Eclipse yep that's what they look like after you've smoked them, instant clean my favorite kind not that I don't understand rubbing dirty ashtrays but somehow I'll learn to you without it, before we go one step further I gotta show you this okay you already know Eclipse has no ashes because it doesn't burn down as I mentioned so watch this Eclipse can lie flat on the table without leaving burn marks so if your cigarette accidentally falls out of the ashtray it's less likely to burn the table carpet or your clothes now that's good news for shirts slacks sofas and car seats All Over America hmm one thing to remember though, Well there's almost no smoke at the lid and the tip is still hot so do be careful guys how does it Clips do all this let me tell you I wondered myself but actually it's simple let's go to the videotape from RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company the folks who created eclipse, eclipse primarily Heats tobacco instead of burning it that's the basis for its many benefits yet it's made much like any other cigarette with a special difference at it may from high-purity carbon this tip is wrapped in an insulating heat barrier that keeps the tobacco roll from burning down the rest of eclipse is just like other cigarettes a blend of fine tobacco followed by a regular cigarette filter that's how it's made, that is it work r.j. Reynolds as you smoke your eclipse the heat barrier keeps the tobacco roll from burning down inside the cigarette instead when you draw warm air passes over the tobacco getting a just hot enough to create a full-bodied smoke that carries the flavor of the tobacco with it let's put it in English the way Eclipse works is something like making coffee when you pour the hot water, all the flavors release from the grounds the grounds are still there when you finish but all the flavors gone so yeah toss them when you're done but guys don't toss your Clips to the tips cooldown do I mention Eclipse taste rich and full-bodied but it's super low in tar and nicotine no well let's hear all about it from the folks at r.j. Reynolds themselves, based on Government testing methods full flavor cigarette Styles range between 14 and 20 milligrams of tar light Styles between 7 and 13 and ultralights between one and six milligrams but Eclipse which primarily Heats rather than Burns tobacco is three milligrams in its full flavor style and to and it's mild style for nicotine full flavor cigarettes typically range between point eight and one point seven milligrams of nicotine, lights range between .6 and .9 and ultralights range between point 1 and point five but eclipses nicotine level is just point to mg in its full flavor and point one and it's mild Style, and that's our math lesson for today seriously here's the bottom line Eclipse taste great is ultra low and tar and nicotine the smoke disappears super fast and there's 90 percent less secondhand smoke why how because a clip smoke is different than other cigarettes, smoke particles from other cigarettes are about twenty percent water and glycerin but a clip smoke is the reverse about 85% water and Glycerine glycerine is something found in all cigarette smoke as well as many food products and baked goods the smoke is mostly water and glycerin there's almost no smoke off the lid and so no wonder these 90% less secondhand smoke but is there anything in the Smoke of an eclipse that you would find in other cigarettes nope just more water and glycerin that's why all, all I smell the flowers that's why it clip smoked taste super smooth and disappears super fast just like I used to have two whenever I lit a cigarette, of course the real deal is Eclipse is a little different at first oh yes it is a real cigarette it's a great-tasting real cigarette it's not a cigarette alternative or any of that kind of stuff but you do sort of have to get used to it in the beginning but for me that's all part of discovering something so new and wonderful all right then let's give it a whirl first and foremost you need a good strong flame when you light an eclipse get use a car lighter you need a direct flame and you need to take an extra, a group of 42 when you light it that's because you're lighting the carbon tip not the tobacco, now you already know Eclipse has no ashes because it doesn't burn down like your cigarette does that mean Eclipse doesn't last as long no way eclipse last just as long as my old cigarette about six or seven minutes I know I timed it, another thing I discovered with the clips the best flavor comes from regular gentle Puffs now if you let it sit for a while the tip May cool down but not to worry and extra Puffs will get it going again and when you start getting less smoke and The Taste gets weaker, well that's how you know your Clips is just about done, there's no question about it Eclipse really is a whole new world for us smokers now some of the great things like no ashes you discover right away others you appreciate after a while like one day maybe you take out your favorite sweater for me it's the one I was wearing when Bill proposed and guess what no cigarette odor or you walk into the house and it smells clean and fresh or you're in your car smoking a clip to you realize, wow I'm smoking with the windows up I didn't even notice, here's another thing you'll discover the freedom you have when you smoke an eclipse so now I can tend to My Little Darlings without being tied to an ashtray but you know you really won't see how great a Clips can be if you keep smoking your old brand so hang with the clips exclusively for a week or so and you'll see the difference, would I Barbara steer you wrong but you don't have to take my word for it listen to this my first took the eclipse home I said you are not going to believe this cigarette wow this is what I wanted this is exactly what I was hoping for it tastes wonderful I took equips to work and I took it down to our smokers room and the other smokers in the room were amazed there was just no smoke lingers, hang in there it was just unbelievable you don't get the tobacco smell in your clothes we like the idea that the windows didn't get fogged up and in the car especially because that can get a little nasty I don't see you having to paint once a year the inside of your house because it's getting yellow to me is reduction of the tar and nicotine in the cigarette is by far one of the best reasons they serve, piety I mean if you're a light smoker there's lights I'm a menthol smoker and there was full flavor and lights there was also the regular I Believe full flavor and lights so they're definitely choices it's more enjoyable than a regular cigarette that's the honest truth when I smoked a Clips it makes me feel free to enjoy my cigarette without offending the non-smokers I would say it would definitely be one of the only Innovative cigarettes I, I've ever heard of well that's the story about an incredible new cigarette called eclipse and incredible new cigarette that gives you all the pleasure of smoking with 90% less secondhand smoke, there's no lingering odor almost no stains no ashes and low low tar and nicotine all in a full-bodied smoke with super taste who knows with Eclipse maybe marriages All Over America will get better maybe, it will be the dawn of a new day of Harmony across this great land maybe chocolate will spend your life okay so that was a little overboard truth is there will always be people out there who won't like that cigarette in your hand period but for the people you like the people you want to be around for you eclipse is a real step forward well I could go on and on but I don't have to aren't you lucky, because you've got a fact-filled brochure that came with this video it gives answers to the most commonly asked questions people have about a Clips but better yet why not try it for free and ask the folks who make it your own questions it's called and a clip sneak preview they're all over town and they're fun you'll meet other adult smokers and it shorts and entertaining like me and don't worry about obligations there aren't any you won't be asked to buy a thing in fact you'll, get a free carton of cigarettes in regular or Menthol Jeff for coming you could even bring along a friend who smokes just call one eight hundred seventy eight seventy eight seventy eight to try it right now or fill out the enclose card and hey tell him Barber

gmpj0015,"huh,finished with our annual meeting for this year, obviously I'm very pleased with the result of the voting as you all know now on very preliminary vote counts the bulb Brooks late was defeated in I'm not a political expert but from my point of view it's a landslide, I think it's the vote was well from what I understand it was at least three or three and a half times 21 against le beau and my guess is that if you took out his and icon shares is vote as Tiny indeed probably my guess is 821 or maybe even ten to one against his slate so what I see in this is that our, shareholders were listening to what we had to say and our shareholders understood that we were listening to them and that's the important thing because what I think our shareholders recognize is this is a fantastic company with great Brands tremendous Brands internationally and domestically both in the tobacco side and the food side they see the value in the company and they want their management to get back to work and get performance out of this company and that's, it's what we're going to do now that this distraction is behind us so with that said it's just that simple really let me take some questions, yes sir, a spin-off is something that is going to stay a front-burner issue for our board it's an important priority for us but the key thing is we're not going to do something to injure the whole company in trying to do something that today would be unwise more importantly for us right now is to concentrate on our businesses 1995 and the last part of the year we started to get good performance out of our Reynolds tobacco, Echo company which is located here in Winston-Salem we're going to have a terrific year in our tobacco business in 1996 Reynolds tobacco here in Winston-Salem is going to do well and our international business is going to be performing in double digits in 1996 now we're just going to have to let events unfold,I think our shareholders have really had a full analysis on the spin-off they've been through this they've been listening to it now for eight months as you're aware our shareholders not only resoundingly rejected messrs icon and labo but they also rejected the shareholder proposal on a spin-off and what they're telling us is very clear get the value for us that's, Aunt in the wonderful Brands you have at Reynolds tobacco and at Nabisco and that's what they want us to do now and that's what our management is going to focus on yes sir, yes I think what our tobacco company has said publicly and I think what Philip Morris and the others have said is is we're not going to settle those cases we're confident we're going to Prevail in those cases and that's how we feel right now my own view is I wasn't at the castano hearings but I read in the Wall Street Journal and the other papers what you all have read and I think that tobacco industry's defenses are very strong there, he said this year was going to be a very strong year for earnings which ended current while speaking census figures are too low, now I think I think we are job this year is to meet Wall Street expectations and we expect to do that and we also expect to be investing in our tobacco business and in Nabisco now that our balance sheet has been strengthened and that's what I talked about at the annual meeting today how important 1995 was again keep in mind this is a company that had 30 billion dollars of debt just a few years ago and now on an RN Standalone basis we've got that balance sheet down, down to where our debt is completely manageable and we can now focus on strengthening our businesses that's what 1996 is going to be yes sir, well I think you can look right now at Reynolds tobacco and see the job that they're doing with their full share Brands and see that they are on the way back I don't know if any of you saw the in the other day in the Wall Street Journal the article on our new red camel and our leverage how we're leveraging our camel Brands I think the company is doing an excellent job there you've seen the articles about eclipses are Reynolds tobacco company today is a company with a commitment to grow its, it's got new ideas Behind These great Brands and I think we're going to see performance out of Reynolds in 1996 yes, well I can tell you that I have been very much in the business of speaking the Lord shareholders since I've been CEO of this company and I have not heard from mr. LeBeau where mr. icon but I'd speak to any shareholder this company and that's really about all I can say at the moment the only thing I can say about that is, I have no idea what mr. LeBeau is going to do the only thing I know is I've got a mandate from our shareholders to improve the performance of RJR Nabisco and that's what I'm going to do as far as mr. LeBeau is concerned he's going to have to figure that one out for himself now my guess is the resolution was, not defeated as soundly as mr. LeBeau and mr. Icahn were on the other hand our shareholders and the shareholders to whom I've spoken one us to do the best we can to find the right opportunity to spin off the Pisco now my own view is that will come in the reasonably near future but what's critical and I think what our shareholders expect management to do in a board of directors to do is not to wreck the company trying to, do a spin-off first operate the company get the values that are inherent in that company for your shareholders and if you can spin off in the Pisco if you find the right time then go ahead and do it and keep in mind we've separated those companies the viscose got it separate balance sheet now it's in a position to be spun off when the right time is there we'll find the right time that's what I understand yes, no I don't not at this point I only thing I was told really was nothing more than what Mike Harper said to our meeting which is that it did not command a majority of those voting and therefore Was Defeated I don't know what the vote was,I've talked to remember I've talked to quite a lot of our shareholders about why they voted in the consent solicitation and people even though it was a non-binding resolution on a particular issue people had a lot of reasons for voting in that consent solicitation they really some of them voted because they wanted to send us a message that they wanted us to get earnings up at RJR Nabisco as soon as we can others said they wanted increase dividends others said they wanted us to spin off as soon as we could, good and there's a kind of a mixed message there I'll tell you something I myself believe that if we can do it at the right time we should separate these businesses so I share that same view with a lot of our shareholders but what the majority of our shareholders are saying today is they're not going to risk our company to trying to do a spin off at the wrong time, I personally blame him for every darn Penny of it, contingency made in the event of justice department action against tobacco vision, the tobacco company is been well represented in all of these matters they've got terrific counsel I think they've got a very good handle on the kinds of issues they're facing and I don't know whether you call them contingency plans or not but I think they've got all of those issues very well in hand okay well let's take one more question if you have it, I think the fact that we got an opportunity to talk to our shareholders the whole process we've been through has given us a good sense of what they want and you can't always do everything immediately for your shareholders but I have gotten a good sense that they felt the cash power generating power the company is so strong that we ought to try to do more in dividends and frankly that's what we've done okay thank you very much, Jim Johnston good morning everyone let me just briefly say how much I appreciate the tremendous support of our 10,000 employees here in Winston-Salem many of whom, volunteered their time to man the telephones to call shareholders employees shareholders retiree shareholders and shareholders all over the country to help win this Battle Force this little no labo sticker was something our employees thought of and passed around the company we've had tremendous support from the local community from all the people in the brokerage firms to people who care, care about this company and we deeply appreciate the support of all those people and we will do our best to build a great future for this company yes yes, about job, we have an a company-wide bonus system which allows for special bonuses for every single employee in the company when we have a Good Year everyone has a good year over and above their regular pay and benefits are pay and benefits are among the highest in the country period we work hard, hard to to save every job we can in this company every company in this industry everyone has downsized over the last decade the way we keep our jobs is we sell more cigarettes we make better cigarettes and we Market them better that's how we all keep our jobs no Union what what in the hell did the Union do for Liggett & Myers, I certainly hope so,mr.

heard about this cigarette and you before you got the chance to try it and you started what it how did you find out about it did you see written material are you talked about seeing the video did you see anything else other than the video I saw this show me, the tape which is a video they show me about some kind of paper I read an article or the nicotine and on the tar and all the glycerin okay okay yeah the fact is there's a lot of water and glycerin will write correct okay what what were you what were before you got to try it again okay this is you got to kind of go back to when you're just learning about what type of things were you thinking oh my God they're going to kill me they're gonna push on the poison poison, to me that's why I really thought yeah okay so you were kind of skeptical yes I was very skeptical yes okay I wonder what is the like me of all the people and just a phone call I didn't believe it when I first spoke to the person over the phone but then after I came out here and I saw the many people here hey guy living more relaxed and then when I saw that cigarette and I saw the charcoal filter at the tip so you know what we think of what it was it the charcoal filter that was that's what it was yes, you thinking about that going to try to cover monoxide yeah that was a quiet yeah Carmen is all right did you ever get an answer to that question no I did not I never asked a question okay well as soon as they get done filming I'll explain it to you okay it's actually got about the carbon monoxide of about a light cigarette so it's you know less than a full flavor what kind of cigarette we smelt a full-flavored menthol yeah so that has Co that's higher than what eclipse, has or carbon monoxide just like the answer your question yeah what watch watch my hands okay sorry about that let's go so at first you were kind of skeptical what was it like when you first did you try here and you get to bring it home and try it I took it home and try it and we'll show my neighbors okay what was your first reaction when you first lit one up and try it but hard to pull, and I did see then as I smoked it The Taste is nice you know it was Miles smooth and it was like are to me okay was The Taste satisfying very in what how would you explain like it was it and fall okay let's say I was your friend and I see you smoking is a hat looks strange you know how would you say but I bet it doesn't taste good how would you explain the taste and taste was up Mi it wasn't hard it wasn't harsh, it was a smooth it was a menthol taste and I didn't take the - teen taste yeah okay so you'll end up liking the taste okay sorry about that hanging here like when airplanes and stuff go over what when you okay now that you took it home who is the first person that you got to show it to my children okay what was their reaction my daughter liked it because it is, leaving smoke or odor in the air or smell bad smell rather my son was skeptical too you know he liked it he tasted it and it was all right okay what now that after you got the smoke let's say I hoped I wouldn't be would you get your hands on okay scared of that huh, when you act you smoke like let's say a pack all right you finish your first pack, how do you sum up in a word I mean what's what word comes to mind what is it like after it's a smoker for the first time smokes a whole pack of the cliffs, what was that like yeah what do you think they're going to feel are they going to feel disappointed or do not like is this nice it really is I like okay I really do like I think it'd be good for people is traveling on the plains how do you go for people in restaurants so you want to hear about the second hand smoke yeah okay well that's interesting in the restaurants what what do you mean by that well you know there's certain areas in the restaurant where you can smoke or certain areas in them, business where you can smoke some and hospitals to some say you're not allowed to smoke in hospitals period with the cigarettes you can, okay did you show it to any other smokers call yes I have tell me about some stories there what it was like and was mile or in part was they had a real problem with was pulling on it had to be Guinea after that and that was it I am one person to say I don't feel anything you know so that's one element many okay what would do you remember any one in particular that liked it, yes what type of things were they interested in it was to be with one of the guys the job the head chef he really liked it he said let him know when the next test will be done for the regular because he's not into the Menthol and it was a guy that try yesterday he really liked it food taste is amazing pie didn't leave any ashes and then leaving spoken are you like this is like to taste okay the the first guy that you were talking about the try and he wanted to know, when they're going to be on the market yes what do you think do you have any idea what was important to him or what do you like he was amazed he was amazed at the no smoke in the air no cigarette ashes he was amazed about, the taste you know the smoothness of it yeah okay what um what were you were normally talk to me for a second about you were smoking full flavor and what full flavor Menthol I think you were saying come on Montclair now what's what styles and flavors do you like in Eclipse I like I say I like the smoothness of it I like because it doesn't leave any odor in the air or on your clothes on your body, like because without this is just a easy smoke is real tight like that the pools hard First beginning well there is one point when you get to smoking on it almost at the end it burns your finger so it gets real hot yes it does okay are you smoking Eclipse full flavor or Clips miles for flavor okay now do at work are you allowed to smoke, Miss Hale okay so you can smoke regular cigarettes or anything at work here okay does anyone else smoke it you were quite a few people okay words you have you told me about those people or did those people get to see the cigarette with only three people saw their head chef one of the managers and one of the workers and you told me about the head chef did you tell me about the other two yet because they haven't tasted yet it didn't have the time but then we'll try it okay, so they thought the idea was interesting oh yeah how would let's say I smoked you and I smoke - Claire okay and we're best friends how would you compare it to Montclair, no because you taste that tired - that's what you'll taste in in mind Claire but in this Eclipse you don't what will it taste like we are explaining my okay specifically about the cigarette has 90% less secondhand smoke is that something that's important to you or here is very important my daughter doesn't smoke and I think that's unfair who smoke in the house and was smoking around hard as she can get sick, just by I smoke and I don't want that to happen, so it's very important because I heard it secondhand smoke is worse then the person is actually smoking a cigarette okay with what do you what do you think other non smokers would say about this cigarette as it deals with the fact that it has you know all the lot less secondhand smoke what's our reaction going to I think they appreciate it I mean if you want smoking that's your business but don't don't let it affect me you know since I don't smoke and say if I stop, smoking and I wouldn't want to know that smoke around me so that's why it's important for a second a smoker okay have you did you know how long did it take you to notice that this thing didn't have an ash that day the first day and I still have asked right beside me what thumping at it yeah and is that something you're going to miss, I might enjoy that not having Ash's because I can't stand my ashes fall on the floor and like you know children me my I have a son at this that's a girl is long and I can't stand that so it's important okay what what so you have the ashes that are fallen on the floor with a normal cigarette right did you notice anything different when you are smoking and eclipse is a deals with ashes I mean what did you change your behavior anyone you're slow, I liked it it was amazing and I guess that's what a little trouble isn't for the charcoal yeah okay do you think you're going to our have did you notice the talk to me for a second not like the odor of a cigarette and what how eclipse is going to address that for you okay to owner is is a very strong odor for a normal cigarette sometimes feel like herbs and which I don't smoke ruthless, sorry for that earlier okay but it doesn't can you know people get out I say out can get it cost caught up like that I think they do you smoke some reefer no it's not like that it's just a regular cigarette and, and it stinks if I'm like some time I try to stop smoking and my son son still be smoking cessation will get us a room away from me you know because it smells and so it helps in an order where the eclipse won't be having an order strong order like that and go all through your house owner you smell someone smoking in the house okay what about like sometimes smokers will tell me that they've been smoking all day or whatever and then they can smell it all your goes that's right and that's another good thing because, I see it okay my auntie told me you get showered and bathes up in your best soap and birth-death best perfume and then you come out and you put your light a cigarette up and it just takes the whole thing away so while you smoke is Eclipse it wouldn't be like that you know because you like to take a shower and you can put on your best perfume and you want to worry about that over all of your clothes and your hair okay so how has it make you feel I mean now, now you're in a clip smoker do you feel any different as being a smoother yeah because some people are welcome I've had people say we're just making stop smoking so you might make me stop smoking okay that's good or bad again this is there's no right or wrong answers in this is just got your opinions of okay let's see here the what do you think the public is going to say about this cigarette when it comes out on the market what's their reaction going to feel a lot like it a lot, it's the only one I really appreciate it why is that because this is as unique as all I can say is good for people that's in office because you know positions people are traveling on the planes for the hospital you don't worry about people complaining about the second-hand smoke okay if there was one benefit that's most important to you okay what would that be more than before I stop what's it what's the most important thing for you, you as it deals with eclipse, well hurting other people would have smoked the secondhand smoke okay yeah lately the government has come out and they've increased all the regulations on smoking you can't smoke in airports and etcetera on planes what do you how do you how would you explain this visor your congressman and I said well you know it's just a normal cigarette how do you explain the fact that this cigarette might be a little different, if I've never heard about it I'm Tom Costello says more for a pack but I think I'll be more healthier for people that don't smoke I think that like I said ownerless is smooth smoked taste is nice and some going to worry about staining your walls and your curtains your clothes you know y'all on your body and your hair so I want to thank the next person and he goes look like, I said then that's you that's on your washer I harm anyone else with that because my habit all right that's fair enough and you talked just a second ago you mentioned the staining what did you mean by that the studying of your teeth out staying of your your Upholstery and of your curtains you know yeah stuff like that okay how was house eclipse going to be any different than any other cigarette because that leaves those are staying on your guy tried it on your curtains and it's a difference in your teeth you know and then you, here on your hands yeah okay what is, I think that's it's hear anything else guys, I was just going to help you relax yes I do like it now it might if you didn't know I can probably really expressed to him in one paragraph 41 cents or a summary of all the great things about clips that you feel about it in other words he's a smoke rings like hey what is that what's up with that what's up with this cigarette, and and I guess it's almost like you're trying to sell it to him I've been doing just that for you all for you it's a new day it's a new cigarette out on the market but RJ Reynolds is very good cigarette for secondhand smokers yeah it's odorless tasteless and Ashley so I think that's well let me ask you one more, question what not everybody will like the cigarette you know there's two Different Strokes for different folks what type of person is going to smoke eclipse in your mind, people as lesson business yeah okay Kimmy dozen businesses have to deal with a lot of other business right okay did you want something Cary how would you ask your question here adjective for Eclipse like however you feel about the month the greater unique or wonderful amazing articulate the clips are and say that word and then the other thing is like, well is there a single word that can sum this cigarette up yeah it's Unique that's it yeah he closed his unique, okay that's it",0.8172140890697674,0.53240824,0.9128392,gnpj0015,,tobacco;

merchandise self-service and non Self Service on the counter with a shield the XL counter displays are designed to be easily assembled using stacking components of four six and eight pack wide trays all trays were made to accommodate an 8-pack deep capacity to me, it promotional needs, new flexible lorillard carton fixtures were also developed, a 6-carbon wide Promotion Center and an impressive 10 carton wide lorillard fixture for use in high-volume Cardin locations this unit would also impact fully meet the need for lorillard merchandising in retail outlets without an industry carton fixture these Cardin units were also designed to be used in non Self Service environments which shielded locking doors plastic inserts provide the flexibility to, all types of special promotions pack and carton shelves are interchangeable providing flexibility to me merchandising brands in a variety of situations while the fixtures and displays provide significant flexibility impact was also increased through improved point of sale on the fixtures and the displays, exhale package counter displays provide a platform for New impactful Image building and price communicating at point of Purchase New 2 inch high Channel strips were included on the front and the rear of the package display this unit contains an impactful Riser that is also visible from the sides of both sides of the display and can be replaced to feature an attractive attention-getting backlit riser, exhale carton fixtures also were in need of more impactful point of sale in order to support this effort Channel strips are increased from 2 inch 24 inch high we also improve the impact of the Riser card and reduce Confusion by featuring special offer pricing only, the third element of the Excel merchandising action plan was to establish permanent point-of-sale presence this heightened presence would be valuable today and in the future if visibility of product were reduced to this end new and exciting permanent point of sale was developed this permanent point of sale was targeted to to fast-growing classes of trade convenience stores and cigarette stores within specific Excel merchandise, seeing plans here are a few examples, our limited time today would not allow for a complete description of excel retail merchandising program however we do feel that it is very important that we explain to you how successful the program has been to date The increased number of displays placed is exceptional you increased our participation with retail displays in both chains and Independence both full price and price value you increased our overall display face, things in thousands of outlets giving lorillard added inventory brand packing exposure and improving our ability to efficiently meet those work plan objectives but let's talk specifics on how working together resulted in success do you recall earlier in this presentation I indicated that 7000 package displays in General market stores had been lost from 1990 to 1997 I told you that Laurel Arts challenge, has to stem this decline well in four short months you working together regained 3800 of this 7000 store decline in four short months you eliminated over half of a seven-year decline earlier I indicated that another objective was to establish an aggressive multi-component Cigarette Outlet program in this high volume and growing class of trade as Randy spell indicated earlier, here there are four thousand eight hundred of these high volume cigarette Outlets nationally of which lorillard has some form of merchandising plan in over 90% I'm happy to report that you secured over 1,000 of our new multi-component Cigarette Outlet plans since the introduction of excel merchandising on July 1 1997 this represents over 20% of total cigarette Outlets nationally, our primary objective was to secure a full price package display price value package display and permanent advertising in each convenience store I am pleased to report that you achieve this most desirable objective in nearly four thousand two hundred new Outlets once again in only four short months in Chains over 34 chain voids have been filled representing over 1,000 displays were Laurel, art previous Lee had no display and in fact I was just informed by Bob call her Ella that that number is now 38, one of our key objectives was to achieve permanent advertising in conjunction with specific merchandising plans again to date you have achieved commitments of nearly 20,000 permanent pieces of lorillard point-of-sale once again an outstanding accomplishment in fact from July 1 1997 to the end of October just four short months nearly 11,000 new, displays have been placed that's an incredible 13 percent Improvement in total package displays when you consider exhale retail merchandising was introduced only a short time ago and the progress to date has been this positive expectations for the future are high as comprehensive as Excel is today working together to keep Pace with changing Trends has never been more important this, means that in the future all of us must take a leadership role to ensure lorillard merchandising plans are on target from recent competitive information we are seeing new fixturing that accommodates the cigarette category in a back bar scenario it is Apparent from this information that Philip Morris will continue its subversion to dominate backbar merchandising in a potentially restricted retail environment, we have seen Brown & Williamson recently unveiled new merchandising fixturing in all shapes and sizes and they are aggressively pursuing back bar positions r.j. Reynolds also has done its homework with merchandising Concepts featuring hanging displays unlike Philip Morris and brown and Williamson who are aggressively trying to move the retailer to back bar merchandising immediately r.j. Reynolds is taking a more cautious approach in fact r.j., nose is urging retailers to wait for a final resolve of legislation before facilitating expensive merchandising sets, Laura large objectives in the future clear not only to defend but improve our position in the urban markets icky stronghold where lorillard icky stronghold were in on Self Service environment has been the norm for many years we must take advantage of our strengths in any Market where we are or are close to being the industry leader in chain accounts where we had in the past suffered the greatest losses we must continue to improve, our merchandising status by aggressively seizing opportunities revealed through new merchandising Trends all of the above can and will be accomplished as we continue to analyze our merchandising plans and Hardware to address the needs of an unclear but opportunistic future the key ingredient is you communicating current trends while continuing to aggressively sell the best merchandise, using plan in the industry Excel yes the objective is clear working together we will achieve continued success thank you and it is my pleasure to introduce to you Steven and long, thanks

grfy0038,"hello and welcome I'm Mark Firestone vice president and Associate general counsel of Philip Morris companies here in New York City today we have gathered employees from each of the Philip Morris operating companies they will be serving as your representatives as we talk about the litigation facing the company we're going to bring all of you up to date on some recent developments that you may have read about or heard about and we're going to answer your questions about what all this means to Philip Morris and to you, the employees who are the hearts and souls of this great company our employees are joined today by Chuck wall senior vice president for litigation and Associate general counsel of Philip Morris Chuck is responsible for managing the company's tobacco litigation we also have with us today Steve Parrish Steve is senior vice president and general counsel of Philip Morris USA and in charge of our worldwide Regulatory Affairs Department here in New York, we'll begin with Chuck it will start things off Chuck everyone at Philip Morris is committed to developing producing and maintaining world-class products and we are equally committed to a vigorous defense of our rights to produce those products we have consistently been successful in court because we have followed a simple straightforward course of action, when we are challenged in court we will aggressively defend ourselves, and when government agencies and others attempt to take away our legal rights we will go to court to ensure that we retain those rights, as many of you are aware the company is involved in several areas of litigation that are of extreme importance both to the company and the industry, most of this litigation is in the United States although we are seeing cases in other countries as well Steve and I will discuss those cases later, in a few important instances the company has filed suit because it has been necessary to vindicate our position, the company is defending itself against those who would impose liability for health problems claimed because by smoking or by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, there are four general areas we are involved in first there are the traditional smoking and health cases involving smokers who seek to impose liability on the industry for diseases which they claim are caused by cigarette smoking, second there are individual environmental tobacco smoke cases, third there are class action cases either involving smoking and health or environmental tobacco smoke and forth there are state government suits claiming damages from the industry in the form of repayment of Medicaid funds expended on behalf of smokers, I should also mention two other categories of cases that we are involved in, Philip Morris has gone to court as a plaintiff against the ABC television network which falsely claim that we are spiking our products with nicotine, and we have sued the EPA for its arbitrary and capricious classification of environmental tobacco smoke as a human carcinogen, in addition we are involved in a growing number of cases in other countries, in every instance without exception I can say today that the facts and the law are on our side and that I firmly believe we will ultimately prevail, our past experience in litigating these cases teaches us that when all the facts are examined by a jury we win, at the same time each of these cases presents a unique challenge for us and we would like to talk about each area of litigation and then we'll be happy to respond to your questions thanks Chuck Steve why don't you begin with an update on the most recent case that went to trial earlier this year thanks Mark the first area we want to cover is the traditional smoking and health case our most recent case the Rogers case just ended in Indianapolis once again, the jury heard all the evidence this trial lasted a full month and when it was over the jury refused to award a dammit any damages to the plaintiff the case was significant because the plaintiff's lawyer attempted to base much of his attack on the so called addiction Theory the plaintiff was the Widow of a local lawyer Richard Rodgers who died from lung cancer at the age of 52 the plaintiff's lawyer claimed that Roger started smoking when he was a child and smoked up to three packs of cigarettes, it's a day after several unsuccessful attempts to stop smoking Rogers quit after a half-hour visit to a hypnotist the Rogers case focused on to claims by the plaintiff first the lawyers tried to persuade the jury that cigarettes are unreasonably dangerous in large part because of their so-called addictive quality under Indiana Law this type of product liability claim is based on a reasonable consumers expectation of a given product, our chief defense to this claim was the affirmative defense of incurred risk or Assumption of risk that is that Rogers new of acclaimed risks of smoking including addiction yet chose to smoke until he finally quit much of the facts in support of that defense came from Rogers himself he testified in his videotaped deposition that he had known of the risks of smoking since he was a child as an adult he said he took an annual physical that included a chest x-ray because he, concerned about the risks of smoking Additionally the plaintiffs in Rogers sought sought to hold the companies liable on a negligence Theory claiming that the industry should have warned Rogers of the alleged addictive qualities of cigarettes before 1969 when Congress made its first changes to the warning label requirements because Congress mandates the warnings the Supreme Court has ruled plaintiffs cannot Sue on the basis of failure to warn of the alleged smoking risks after 1969, nine the jury and Rogers refused to award damages to the plaintiff and the plaintiffs attorneys have not yet asked the court to schedule a second trial, in the past 40 years there have been over 400 cases filed against the industry all of the companies have taken a firm position against settling these cases and in the 23 cases that have gone to trial none has resulted in any damages being paid to a plaintiff yet plaintiffs lawyers continue to try and there are a number of cases on the horizon including one in New Jersey that could come to trial by the end of this year thanks Steve before we turn to the ETS, class action and State Medicaid cases that have been filed against our company and other cigarette manufacturers I'd like Chuck to talk a little bit about how we think these cases have come about thanks Mark we believe that a small organized group of plaintiffs lawyers are behind all of the recent lawsuits these plaintiffs lawyers who have become famous for targeting various

grgv0183,"thanks for coming out in the rough weather, okay everybody here, again thank you for coming I appreciate it my name is Keith they're going to give me a name tag here in a second and we'll get started what we're going to be doing a lot of homework tonight so everybody brought you glasses and your writing hands okay we're going to do some reading and writing and I'm going to talk about it the first thing we're going to do is fill out the blue questionnaire it's got questions on the front and on the back so if everybody will just take one and pass one to their neighbor and will pass out the, business is a little need to fill that out then we'll start talking somebody got the reach of pencils I can't do it just circle the circle the answer and we'll get started I will I'll tell you is your as you're going here that what we're going to do tonight this is part of a research project in which we're doing several of these around the country what we're investigating is how the media treats us corporations, and it'll become a pretty apparent we're going to it says business week at the top we're going to look at a business week article about a major corporation in fact it's one of the ones you can see there it's kind of controversial and we want to see how how people how Americans react when they when they see these things in the media all right that's largely what we're doing so that's why we're doing this question first and we'll have some other things for you to fill out, but one other request to everybody has a number one through 10 on their name tag if you put that number up at the top where it says ID code is put your number in others three slices put it in somewhere,it looks like we're pretty much done the main company that is being asked about there's Philip Morris so let's focus on that a little bit what are your overall in pinions of Philip Morris, anybody just go ahead and jump in a study the ground rules are speak freely speak openly age no right or wrong answers, if I were throwing out they've got six make cigarettes I think I got that too how many people have a bad boys in here check it around the country this morning oh really I got about 90% of the people I run into that voices right now, it was a it was a million dollars we'd all be rich because it was catching it again or something that is that Y2K bug Vicki what do you think it's like you said they are just said first thing you think of is me keeping the commercial for like you know cult film horse that's associated with and I think they're always going to be associated with cigarettes and I what else to do I'm not a really throw bottle I only make like tobacco products and cigarettes and I'm just alone Amin Osman, Walker and I'm against smoking in general but that's you know my opinion so I understood like number for question I kind of had kind of a sliding between one or two because in number one you can understand when senior Executives in the company they do have legitimate jobs to yet you know it's tough to like really small but the answer on that one for me so let's talk about that one that's pretty Stark, contrast that they're making you make it how many people chose that I think many people chose the second one while he's a appreciate that they give money and I appreciate that they do jobs but basically they're doing that and they're killing people and they don't mind that that's okay and it's supposed to be okay why because they've got lots of money and they can give money to politics and politics can pass the bills and pass their needs so if, you're going to ask me to be so starving I'm going to say you know what they're doing is immoral because if they really were trying to put money in the right direction they wouldn't be trying to harm people so that's why I feel sorry if you from Philip Morris, everybody could look just look at your lungs, Take a Bow, an x-ray of your lungs and see what the smoking is doing to it I don't think that I don't know some people doesn't matter either okay how about somebody took the other part of number for their senior Executives any other company have legitimate job to do okay I guess I feel that I guess especially since the early 60s when they put the warnings on the packs and and I really believe that we as a government and or Society or to look worse, self straight in the face and say if you want to make something illegal make it illegal but to start this nonsense where you're putting monetary considerations on education and people's lives and you're not brave enough to make it a legal and put her out of business we ought to look at ourselves in the mirror and be ashamed of ourselves,did you think it was accountability to the public or the accountability to the cigarette companies also I think that I think that as far as Executives having a job to do and as far as Executives having a job to do and as far as people working for that company yes it's it's tobacco it's also a lot of other things and I also think that since the early 60s and since, the warnings have been out there and we will allow people to create their own decisions in life about so many things did to litigate this thing for the profitability of a few with absolutely very limited chance of any gain through education all you have to do is look at those ridiculous Billboards on the Schuylkill Expressway the probably won't taste teenagers to smoke now if this is what you want to do here and that's fine that's fine now and then this this is another, I'm liberal or conservative or intelligent or unintelligent but if this is what the intelligence of America says that we should do I think that we need that we need to take a mirror effect for any positive effects and really shake our head at this one and as far as people having the right to work you know what they have the right to work and they have the right because you know what there's a lot of people who make bombs there's a lot of people that you have no Concept in the software business how that software is being applied and there's a lot of them are all stuff that goes on and, litigate it through the courts and the blame executives are governmental to hang our health said head and shames and his voters would hang her head and shames that's why I wear I had a problem with it the question was because I work for a little I used to work for a large pharmaceutical company types of drugs and I mean some people may have problems with what those drugs could do or what we have in there but that yet and as a cohesive unit of being part of the company I enjoyed that and like like the benefits and what that what you know what the company can do for you, but you know they make drugs that are controversial Florida you chose the legitimate I'm a nonsmoker I've never smoked and I hate being and Smoky room and I wish there were more and non-smoking restaurants and clubs and more like California where the restaurants and clubs are all non smoking however I believe in freedom of choice and I agree with Kip a lot that there is, enough out there weren't enough mornings and enough information out there that people have a freedom of choice they can choose to smoke with could choose to stay healthy and not smoke and I don't think it's up to the government to make that decision for you I don't like all that government intervention do you think that Philip Morris is a is a cigarette company is changing at all or they pretty much stay in the same the windows being, but it's obviously we're seeing the whole public opinion environment in the whole legal environment change around them are they changing or not Beverly please do I think of changing I think the diversifying and all sorts of other products and everything I think they're trying very hard to diversify themselves specifically from tobacco and going into all kinds of other fields and public relations and you know all that sort of thing I think they're trying to change greatly but I think basically people still think of Philip Morris is you know brought in tobacco people, eagle, Ricky I was like stuck right between the Middle was like I didn't really wanted it and really like to for the answer before I believe in you if you want to smoke and smoke and you know you have the right to choose and there's going to be as most people buy the products going to be jobs created by it and people need jobs they're going to go to where they can get the money how about how about them changing and what you think they're changing Michael, I mean I think they're changing because they have to because people getting tired of statistics of 100 literally hundreds of thousands of people die a year from smoking related causes I think just to keep themselves going, I think people are tired of lying and I don't think I think that they really had you know hit the wall with that so I think that they have to clean up their act so I really believe that they are changing well does anybody see the movie the inside people suddenly get the feeling that, I mean those tactics that they described in that movie must be fairly true although it wasn't Philip Morris to company but, the tactics that are described must be true otherwise they may be open who lived and fought it for 30 years you know to not let people know what they were doing and then move on to other organizations where people are even less educated than we are in this country about cigarettes that that I find absolutely deplorable and move on to where people don't know even the slightest bit, we know which isn't everything and then you know try to push the cigarettes on to people who don't know if I have a surgeon general's warning on exactly the point about that about it's right there this this stuff is harmful but most people start smoking when they're teenagers and who makes that they can good good decisions when you're a teenager, statistics in front of me that if you don't smoke before your, you 21 your chances of ever smoking are very small something like that I don't excuse me I'm not talking about a cigar or whatever so that you know don't tell me that the Brain Trust the new in full Morris or anything I mean they don't know what they have to do regardless of what they put on the advertisements or their promotional stuff or give away free jackets or any of that they have to hook people young and they're probably not the only consumer, other companies or behavioral companies that have to hook people lunch young don't tell me that the beer companies they liquor companies and all that your behavior doesn't start at twenty one or twenty six Behavior starts at and you know what there's another thing and I'm a parent don't tell me Behavior doesn't start with parents and what they allow the kids to do where is accountability in this world where somebody could really look at themselves in the face and say you know what, I've done everything I can do and they're accountable to your kids into yourself and I there's so little accountability in this world it's sickening everybody's all right go ahead Lisa I wanted to say just because you put the label not you but Philip Morris put some a label it's hazardous to your health if Kip decides he's going to light up a cigarette right now he's not just making the decision for himself he's making a decision for the entire room you just big kids because just because, my choice is now not my choice anymore and what happens is if I said to Kip Kip would you mind smoking outside often Kip would say yes I do mind smoking outside I have the right to smoke I choose to smoke I am being harmed by that I have secondhand smoke and that is offensive to meet the warning label means almost nothing to me on that, Point okay and in a lot of respects they're now finding that secondhand smoke is worse than the actual sense of um choosing not to smoke the choice is being stripped for me now I don't have the right I told you we were going to look at an article or put these out in front of you I don't want you to read them yet let's just I guess I'll pass them around I can't reach that far that's past my just kind of put it in front of you look at the cover just look at the cover the part about Philip Morris don't read the inside yet it's rather, link the article but look at the cover I want to I want to put your answer some questions about it and actually instead of talking about it I'm going to pass out sheets and you have to write so this can be writing exercises there's three questions just write in a few short answers if you put a few short sentences clause and speech 141 word you want, there's three questions what's the main point communicated by the cover what do you think the main focus of the article is going to be and all you know says what is the main folks are we think the main focus your articles going to be and what impact does this cover have on your perceptions of Philip Morris any or not and if it reconfirms if you already think you can just put that down,reacting to the cover,okay then when you finish filling that out you can take the time to read this I think if you read every single word the way I read which is about third grade level it takes about 22 minutes to do it so let's see if he can kind of move through it in about maybe you know a little less and I like 15 15 18 minutes and I'll everybody just read through it and then we'll talk about it, this was an article that appeared in businessweek I'm a bad at the date on it I guess November 29 so right after Thanksgiving,by the way anybody read this, I'll put some popcorn in the middle anybody wants some lovely if you get thirsty there's a little tray drinks over here to feel free to get up and keep reading when you get a drink, I'll be right back,one last piece of business is put your number on the yellow sheet to like you did on the blue then there's two sides to the yellow sheet in case you didn't see it just like that,it's like we're about ready how about somebody offer up a comment for me about what you think after reading this, you know the road rage area it's amazing that they have corporate people haven't been shot I mean really and truly a bunch of crazy so you know besides you have to say that for the money they're being paid I take the risk to if I mean if they could live with themselves for what they're being paid and I think it's that hard decision for them to stick it out because if they're pay me half a million dollars a year I don't know that I you know don't but don't tease people have various towns where let's say they're earning a, a million dollars a year somewhere else where they can go somewhere else they could and make some money they probably could but don't they have but don't but don't they have individual rights working in a legal job they want so that the concept is somebody coming on my property putting anything on my door and doing all that or if my if my if my wife had a mink coat throwing fake red blood on her something like that I mean nobody wants to be treated but now I don't think that's all he said your rights, it was like a lot of food for thought and everything I am a non-smoker have never had a cigarette in my mouth but um, you know it's very but your smokes smokes smokes cigars so am I here Pat you didn't say the word but I'm not hearing the word sympathetic I definitely said that that I mean I you know it's just, you forget I mean it honestly and truly I don't know that I even thought about you know like I'm a nice Miguel kid that has lung disease so you know I mean he's smoking I don't want to sit near people that smoke you know I'm very verbal when I'm out in a place and there's somebody smoked I don't want them near me Etc but you know you think about how crazy you know I'm not crazy like that the you know with the right you know and to think about the road things that they would have the family you have to feel sorry I don't care how much money he's making I mean, abuse is got to be, would anybody else use that word after reading this article Lisa but I guess I kind of disagree with that sort of, who's there getting before we before we get there I saw is anybody agree with Pat the sort of feel more sympathetic toward the top corporate people after seeing this I understand okay I just want to get a sense if it's okay go ahead Lisa I did I did understand more of what they're doing because I was told things I didn't know before but I don't feel sympathetic and I guess I don't think that they're entitled to feel badly if people are lashing out at them and their home, when I am in a place that I think is private like a table that I have paid for to have dinner with my husband and evening I am being assaulted by the smoker next to me that's not a corporation but not but it is it is the CEOs fault because if if they didn't continue to take that job and they didn't continue to hire troubleshooters to find ways to manipulate advertising and manipulate people to smoke there wouldn't be that person next to me because the cigarette wouldn't be there and they can figure out, put their genius to know something marijuana is illegal to have come it's all over the place I mean you know also from having that liquor you know it's killing things next because they pay somebody a lot of money to run a corporation to be smart I don't think they physically have to take news from people and I you know and thinking about it look, you can't you have to give the guy credit to they're trying to turn some things around whatever way you want to look at it they trying to because they'll lose their money sharehouse truth and their greed will make them find somebody's billions enough they don't want to lose money they want their companies to continue when the profit shares dug up their pockets upper their home suffer their families don't get what they want but these people are intelligent people that could go to any Corporation big Korver I don't think why why you know I don't understand why he's not her or what gives him the standard who's maybe beliefs and maybe he can make a, France and change but Wars happens to give a lot of money to education I don't people know don't want to take it I mean your kid goes to college e you would like some Financial backing even if it did come from it you know if it's going to help you swim away I don't think so it was Michael wouldn't would he what do you think about this this article after getting it was your reaction well he told me some things I didn't know but, I don't like what you mean again, first of all I know there's some of the executives of top Executives and programs that put the personality a little bit into what's behind the corporations and I still get I get the feeling that these guys you know they're saying there that they don't have they're trying to get away from this bunker mentality but that's I think that's what still coming through it, it's very adversarial all the time and they were just keep trying to find ways to maneuver around I mean basically the cigarette part mean they're just trying to sell as many cigarettes is that cat and that is their main concern too, just keep increasing the market share at work no matter how they can do it basically what they're going there pointing to is, taking it away from other cigarette companies you know I think they're realizing they can't grown the way to increase their share is to actually combat other cigarette companies and not and increase the overseas wherever they can I mean that's the whole point good we'll just being illegal, come out of you I mean how can you, be you know how can you be against it in the sense I mean this is that's what our country stands for I mean I agree with you I think Lisa's Point as far as public, use of that stuff I mean I don't like it either I mean not anymore I was at a party Saturday and just coming on because I was getting physically sick everybody you know so many smokers so I don't like it but you know I it's what are you doing after reading this, I was amazed at how well I didn't know they were so Diversified or trying to make so we go to survive in the in the early part of the article is talking about a hundred million dollars to persuade kids not smoke what they mean how where did it go what kind of education but what were they telling the kids you know most of the ads that, see now I'm also the ones that I've seen are you know making it cool to smoke and you know yeah but they have their size they are under 18 you know you didn't have to sell cigarettes to the kids you know we ID people and everything like that, he jumps over Brooklyn Bridge do you want to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge to be sexy and hot and funny and that is it they're selling they're not advertising the Brooklyn Bridge they are advertising sex appeal and coolness but smoking I can I come in but I don't know that I can protect my son and my daughter I know that in my house I won't allow certain things but when they're allowed to go out make their own decision they're in college I don't, know what they're doing you know if you can teach you how I did it and that's all you have to do is I hope I do I came from a family that's why didn't I smoke I've never had a cigarette in my mouth, I mean so you know why is everybody else here you hope that you instill in your children the right things to do I mean let me ask you a question about the nature of this article how do you think this magazine business week in the reporter I think they treat biltmore's they fair or not, a lot of what women like they're saying about how they were harassed because of their position but also show that you know they're going to stick by their their job they're going to stay in it and like with the guy whose families are sort of well as a matter of priorities which was more important is family the security of his family at the job again, what's interesting point was about the other employees to there's they are, I'm not charged yeah are being attacked or anything within feeling bad about where the work I feeling hear about them where they were I found that interesting and also that they're paying higher salaries to get people into the competition, here we come back to I'm going to pay you 40 thousand dollars in a fifteen thousand dollar signing bonus right out of college to come and work now you're going to sit there and some 22 year old can use in the same geez I can go work for the city and I could get a twenty two thousand dollar job and Philip Morris or anybody and the other major corporations who were about to craft I don't care who it is we'll sit down say here it is oh and by the way you're going to start at forty thousand dollars a year but guess what here's, check for fifteen thousand dollars just for coming with us thanks a lot you think the going to turn it down you know what it's really do that person number one is goes up there's like this company White's what I'm able to do for them and I can go places in at that's the main concern well what do you mean concerns you well I think that a lot of people they are especially a lot of young people now they want to get ahead I mean that's that's the thing and it's like if they can they can kind of look at the company and see maybe we'll look it, all the positive things are doing and kind of get away from what the company really is because you know when iI can't I don't totally know what I would do if I was younger and I I don't think I'd want to but they really make it so enticing that it's something that you really think there's a company today you can get away with what it got away with 20 years ago I don't I think it's a different kind of world I think we're all skeptical I think that we don't trust anybody or anything there's no there's no trust your neighbor trust your, and you know you go out into a world that you know what we're more aware more opinionated we're more everything more so more vocal about everything you know if you don't hear from your mother your father your family going to hear from the next person sitting next to you can light up a cigarette whether you like it or not do you make a choice to smoke it to work for a company or companies going to be good to you and you needed to pay off your college loans or keep your family do you just are and you're working hard hard to justify your choice and stuff but who's to say that the company is not trying to change a little bit, B I mean so they're going after market will you know what we have to inform the rest of the world but we as United States of America are really made this company Rich Jeff I don't know if I'll let you finish but your train of thought about them offering this kind of money it was that do you see that as a positive yes I do number one for the younger generation is going out now looking for employment and this isn't necessarily Philip Morris or any of the other tobacco companies it, any company, everybody has become goal-oriented at this point from College on even in high school to get through college to get to the big job a real job and there's nothing wrong with that this is what everything is geared to American Dream, what's happened is to the exclusion of everything else that's where the focus is going with our young kids, unfortunately it doesn't matter whether they go to Philip Morris or anyplace else they become egocentric and Company will give this is the second time you read it you the only person I ever did before what do you think what are your reactions, on reading this article well I really did not die my guess I go back to accountability so that I'm not sure why I changed you know and I follow Philip Morris both you know because I'm involved in some investment things as far as researching as much as I can as a sort of a job at night and I know a lot about the company had followed it for years and I also am not a smoker so that, nothing changed with the article because I'm still holding on the concept of accountability and I just see very little little accountability on this issue in the broader scope in this country I see very little guts for our legislators that you just flat-out commands they make it illegal know maybe Al Capone would come back from the dead Fields a but nonetheless make it illegal and case in point the past head of the federal Food and Drug, stration a guy named Kessler, is trying to get the FDA to regulate nicotine well that's a farce and it was already in articles by like judge souter and judge O'Connor have come out and said how can the Food and Drug Administration and it's in the Supreme Court right now how can they regulate nicotine we can just outlawed how can the Food and Drug Administration if a drug is harmful does it get through the fog Food and Drug Administration no well how can they regulate it it was it's the stupidest thing in the world and yet we'll go through the legal thing of going through, because nobody wants to be accountable to any truth nobody and it's a farce but if we want to go through this legal imaginations well that's what we do every day when somebody rear ends you you know if you fall in your own house you break your leg and your phone your neighbor's house you might think twice about suing them before in Bloomingdales you got a lawyer out right away and soon but you're still broke your leg install your own fault okay that's the country we have we're going to sue everybody we're going to not going to be accountable for our own actions that's where we are, and I think a lot of people mostly Beverly Hills see you're talking you would what do you think what's your reaction to this article my reaction to the article is that it gave me some insight into different different ideas that they stressed in the article but it didn't change my mind about Phillip Mars it didn't change my mind about I agree with kids about it's not only felt Mars it's everyone along the line all the way up to the Congress the president the legislative judicial It Go all, everybody's out for the money and so it gave me some you know insight into how they think but I always I think I also knew that they were one-sided they're very one-sided they have to be in order to work that job you can't go to work thinking well maybe I should really think of the kids smoking and lung disease and and we've waste more money on on the after effects of tobacco than any other disease in the country and I don't think they can go to work that way and it just stress that to me, it's sort of reinforce what I thought the article but gave me a little bit more insight, all right, what about the guy on the cover here Jeffrey Bible how do you think he comes across introspective, introspective yeah that's the way that's the first that I had when I looked at where are we going the company what's going to happen I have to get my you know my point across but I'm thinking but it definitely looks introspect use comfortable in his own skin that he's going to whatever decisions he makes you'll stand by them and I really don't think that it matters what anybody else thinks and I'm not saying he's so cocky about it he's just a man who's comfortable with himself,I think he loves contemplative as if he's no he has the weight of the world on your shoulders if I saw this are flying didn't see it if I would see it I would look through it I would because I would want to see what he was thinking what he was saying although it wasn't very different from what I anticipated but I think he's very contemplative and thinking like how can he do better and you know that kind of thing that's what it's stress is it looks like we have a problem with our image and let me see let me tell you what I think, think it's about you know it's an interesting thing with the ashtray the cigarette that's the first thing I saw and to me contemplative probably is giving the guy more positive this looks like a tough little guy who's really going to defend his turf, and he comes across in the article as being he's you know he's been in there long time now you know, I think he's sort of the challenge there's a challenge a company with the trouble and he's now they recruited him and he's had a lot of years of experience he is ready to retire looking forward to retiring and she took on this challenge, it's very interesting pose very and if it will take you to look at it there's an old daguerreotype photograph sitting down on Washington in the Smithsonian of Abraham Lincoln you put a beard on him and look at that you I'm going to tell you something this is a very very very intelligent strong, I'll tell you one thing I really, I would not want to do battle with him now you're like a casual post for the spine or strength you know make no bones about it I mean I think I've made it clear that for freedom of choice but make no bones about it I firmly believe these guys are the Prince of Darkness because they know what that the product has been bad now they are making the byproduct this point of another generation that now they're in the hot seat because don't forget that the back of company, had a pretty darn good in the 50s the 60s the 70s the 80s they want every tobacco case they could and through various legal ramifications that we have in this country we were able to you know they're able to attack the cigarette companies just like they might attack you know the industries that every one of us are in for whatever reason I don't know what those Industries are but the the down deep these are this is not a good thing it just depends whether you believe I think that this guy has the right to say Hey look it's freedom of choice now come on over at either declared it, you're damn right there's a problem got some great PR guys too because you're making the there's one problem with Claire you want me to tell you what it is yeah hold the bottle it doesn't matter the company Philip Morris makes but if you've ever see you've done your research every atom throw smoother believe me I'm not a make 35 cents a pack of cigarettes gloves and where's all the rest of that money go let me tell you where it goes It goes, into taxes so beautifully your state level the start they think it's okay to not only take in Revenue all these years they think it's okay to sue the tobacco companies for more money and then we're going to try to do it on a federal level let's go we're trying to do on a place actual level individuals get you know get together and when it ends where does the money for all those programs more we're going to go, after the liquor companies the beer the brother Brewing company's let's see the people put fat and potato chips and it's going to be never-ending because the differences though smoking, the smoker is hard and not just yourself but those around you can still be around smokers will sometimes you don't always make it about 10 years ago 10 years ago your argument had a lot of strength to live every day now more 10 years that your arguments been watered down because not only can't most people smoke at work but you know I don't think they'll do it right outside the door, unless of course you get behind the wheel and you kill me you're right however absolutely right the smoking part that is not just harmful to yourself but it is to those around you it is it is it is depreciated it's 10% of what it was 10 years ago you can't smoke on airplanes anymore you can't smoke and that's fine I'm also thrilled with it don't get me wrong you can't smoke on set the buses you can't with her, wrong baby that's not an issue anymore believe it or not it's not really a big Health concern issue you might not like the way your clothes smell but you're not going to inhale enough smoke going to a party one night staying three to four hours to get lung cancer emphysema that is good question we we've touched on this a little bit nobody really elaborated though I want you to please in this article they talk about how Philip Morris owns crap food and Miller Brewing how does that make you feel about those other companies, these that they're owned by they're essentially a cigarette come pick up craft because we've always had a good reputation that is good that's a positive I mean that's just something that just kind of subconsciously with her board foot is like the soothing thing of the Americans I mean it's macaroni and cheese in it, it stays within their concept of expertise in marketing and it really does, okay let me let me just highlight a couple of paragraphs that argued only not open up your pages I'll just tell you the there's one early on where the CEOs got Geoffrey Bible talks about how he how he changed and I can went from fighting to negotiating with critics that now who knows his idea to give up or he voluntarily gave up the Marlboro Man as an advertising symbol and they agreed to though hundred and seventy five billion dollars set, moment, what do you think of that that went through that part of the story let's reaction to that Kip I think that it kind of their heads and said brand names is what everybody's trying for and marble is the number one brand and they wouldn't give up anything else bad there's no sincerity in that whatsoever took it off the tennis courts and everything else, honking man on this horse and that they settled it down a bit pushback from it so you know I think it's in advertising, they settle it down but there's no way you believe them no it doesn't it doesn't make you do they have no choice of how much advertising do you believe not very much, okay then there was the next one to talk about we're alluded to a little bit one of the other Executives I think his name is semantic he's the one that had the wreath put on his house talk about his wife and then he said when he said a parties somebody asked him a question he said I can't live somebody else's life, remove risk from the from their lives we're spending a hundred million dollars a year on anti-smoking campaign for youth anti you smoking there's no Billboards we've trained thirty thousand retailers that space kind of spot fake IDs so we're trying to do something about underage smoking what do you what do you think about when you read but you know what, he was not to hate seeing somebody just said they're covering their but they do it in a very Insidious way, they actually have seen some programs on the what they actually do in the anti-smoking campaigns it's pathetic it's as if you know it's so pathetic that you think just used to act as if they're they're actually coming on strong and in fact they're not coming on strong at all so they say we spent you know 1 million in this area 1 million in that area they know you know that they spend in that area is so calm particular sits just it tells the kid such a mixed message that it's not strong whatsoever one thing, just like he says he spent 100 million anti-smoking campaign I would like to have seen how much they actually spend on Advertising pre-pro advertising just to see what kind of percentage they're spending forehand Time by see kids can buy cigarettes as easily as they could mind years ago I really I really honestly truly believe that I don't think kids can go into war or 7-Eleven and buy cigarettes like they could have been beyond the three, is it not enough I don't know and why aren't they buying cigarettes they trying to buy the cigarettes where the parents again you know so I can't ability again I think that you know I don't know good food it was very quickly I think it was two separate issues what semantic said one was I can't live somebody else's life and the other was yeah look we're spending a hundred million dollars on the one sense he was saying look you know people have freedom of choice and then I think he just destroyed, his own position by saying look what good guys we are we spend a million here hundred million there and that's simply put in the cost of doing business to generate a profit don't tell me it's for the public good it's a business, I give them credit because they are responding to the need and the demand the demand has sure been it is necessary to have that, give them credit for then still shoving down a carcinogenic but I do give them credit for accountably answering to the public anger and was being set forth to them but I'm just saying well forget it this is what we're doing this damn by be careful if they can't so now their hands up against the wall their greed is right there they're going to find ways a rather the very bright men but I do give them the credit that they are at least responding, the next one was the quote from the guy who's responsible for the worldwide the non US market and he makes the point or it says in there was there talking about him that Philip Morris says eighty-three youth preventative programs going in 55 countries and he says quote we don't want kids to smoke because it exposes us to attack as an industry what do you think of that what bothered me most is that they were going abroad, I do live abroad but I'm going to guess they're not as educated and I'm going to guess a lot of places that they're selling cigarettes don't even know to note that they can sue or have the finances to sue the way America does I had a problem with that I wasn't sure where they were actually putting those cigarettes traveling for the little bit that we have we've seen children smoking in areas that I don't know what their regulations are here, we don't result in wah wah here we don't let it go through vending machines as we did before but there we do and they even made the price cheaper to keep up with the competitors well now we're going to offer LNM this the lower price one you can still get a great smoke out of it but it's lower price so who's buying that I think it's a blatant lie start smoking when you're young you probably won't, and they know that that nobody's going to think I stole notice that as many kids what I mean when I was like 13 about a lot of kids smoke II what I still know who's out there nail is seems to be the same thing I still see a lot of kids, 1.2 billion people you want to smoke if you've ever been to the Orient that much time there as I have, today and places of they like to smoke the next one was was the discussion and I think Jeff my brought this up to that whole discussion of you know there's risky products out there there's cigarettes there's beer there's hot dogs you know and if they go after cigarettes today they're going after alcohol next and they're going after hot dogs potato chips when you think of that line of logic that kind of comments on it, it's probably true they're going to get started on the to an extent you know drinking and driving kills people cigarette smoke gives you cancer kills people but if you eat a potato chip and choose to kill yourself I choose to eat and be fat you know Mom I'm called to my already so who's accountable me you and I'm saying gee I'm not hurting anybody else around or her life yeah idea but the idea, but yeah but the idea of that you know oh my gosh like they're putting some Molina in the product and you know that were Sweet and Low like hopefully having one after Sweet Love years and years ago I mean great cancer brain tumors will diabetics have been using sweet love for 100 years and guess the wash cycle makes this is what they want so they took the siren Off the Mark but it's not hurting anybody there were people making the graduate school starts, in 10 years from now will be the be your company's okay so how is this as a line of reasoning for Philip Morris to make is it effective or not I think I think the public relations department in these companies are going full head of steam last time I looked in the 60s there was something called the domino effect where the whole world was busy going to be communist, it's actually going the other way I mean that was the big war machine thing well you know if we don't stop in Vietnam got it will go all over the place you know and I think you know we already have a situation where we're okay is a country to keep taking away accountability now whether you want to call a domino effect the hot dogs too you know fats and stuff like this other thing but we're already allowing the lack of accountability in this country, anybody else with the domino effect with other products is this I mean even though cigarette companies admit it's addictive now and that takes it out of the ground with just being able to drink beer whenever you want being you know having a hot dog thing, living a lifestyle it might not be healthy once your Hook when you're 13 or 14 sometimes people can't quit I mean like just you know I don't know personally but the difference between quit like 20 times and he was getting very good at it, you differently than cigarettes to so all along alcohols been viewed differently to back is a big industry is going to meet or this country was founded on the tobacco industry you know and that you take away to back a you take a quart you take the underpinnings of a lot of our economy oh it's almost like a necessary evil major chunk of the tax dollars is what all of your program they're not old as gasps oh about taxing all the other ones make it, is the woman shouts allude to here the the guy who's the head of Miller Brewing talked about having two sons 17 and 24 not wanting either one of them to drink or smoke and saying that it's my responsibility as a parent not the government's to tell them not to what about that total agreement I'm kind of like great but what happens what Kitty says you my dad says not to smoke not to drink and he works for a company that produces the most there's like you know what's wrong with I suppose you don't believe it, child your drink and yet this is where you are peddling your money and where your greed is meeting with I didn't get that the guy is in there and say look I'm making five hundred thousand dollars a year in million dollars well because of you tells us kids don't smoke and don't drink your legal age any responsibility, until that time comes I see you in this house smoking the sunrise my wrinkles appear your fingers then you just say I'm sorry doesn't do anything that little statement doesn't really do anything to change the image that one might have the company you know it's in it doesn't mean it's just like fluff of course people, going to tell their children that smoke and drink even a CEO of a company that is tobacco run and of course to be responsible but it doesn't change your mind or any readers mind about what they think of that person or what they think at the company because he tells the 17 and 20 year old child have to smoke and drink does it change your mind, there was in the last one that was the lawyer who was at the end he had the story where he was talking they were talking about him where he was watching TV and saw the ABC Story come on about saying that Philip Morris manipulates the nicotine level in cigarettes that he went right out and sued them and won got three million dollar check took out an ad in the New York Times what about that, comment cocky lawyer joke, it's something that you know if you go by The Stereotype of a lawyer it's an expected reaction well don't forget this guy's not just a lawyer from I know this guy's vice-chairman our company is very big I mean there's a little difference between a lawyer and just being a lawyer who's going to just you know throw procedure I'm sorry which said you the first he was there outside counsel mostly and then he was brought on to a much higher position, so she was he did good what do you think about him telling that story sort of the recounting the water big roast yeah it really bothered me because you know what I felt that they were trying to accomplish something with it with me they accomplish something in the beginning they lost it at the end for me personally I don't know I don't know I like it pretty reviled at this the the spin I get from the Press on things and then I'm supposed to just go 60 Minutes must be right, there are this or that you know if it gets to be once again where's the accountability accountability is that when something comes over the air and you're going to call it as gospel truth now I don't know whether it's truthful or not about the nicotine or whatever but if it was wrong and once again it's within our system he should have taken off both shoes throw them through the television set and really sued them to death but is it because that's wrong to accuse somebody if you're wrong, I didn't know whether he you know and don't forget who's right and who's wrong it's not what is right or wrong I know there's a winner or a loser not that is right I just, is it was it semantics they want on or was it fact they want on because I'm in the hood there I said it's not addictive they were form of a logical way that gives it not a drug it's not addictive I was very much an actual win actually know that the tobacco companies have block long as long as, another lawsuit you know what I mean when million it the end Who's the who are the losers in the whole game just it bothered me and I had to tell you that that you know you know about how these places together and like I have a Little Bit of Sympathy prior to and I look at the skies and walk the hell does he have to stay in this company for and 60-some years old is it really good no it's a lot of money, the other side stand up and they well yeah, The Libertine is manipulated but but we're not at all isn't the press and isn't a press a big business yeah okay let me let me go back to the color I got three last questions you know you had one two three four five I guess CEOs or times he has five Executives top Executives of Fillmore's they let businessweek reporter follow them around and write this article should they have done that or not after you read this, sure this is McGraw-Hill this is big business this week is big business is McGraw Health if they think there's money in it to create a story they're not all good to do good is either I mean it was this week's not going to be immediately antagonistic either it's got Little Rock at a much more objective you know made her seem more positive kind of thing, from visit with and they would from Jack no objective where is the reporter objective here, like they're people just like if you live next to an IRS agent what do you what do you do throw a brick through his window no yeah it could be the nicest guy in the world either put a human face on it you know slant to it just from the picture on the cover it just looks silly else have a general expected more favorable article based on the cover or not, unpredictable but it wasn't quite as favorable as I thought it was going to be, business week is pretty young even-handed about most of the things that they do so how do I Fred how do these five of these five people than come across do they come across this is the princes of Darkness or they come across as guys just doing their job typical higher level Executives I think that you would see in any other company to that's what they came across this to me you know like everyone has a part to play, another product they're human beings they are somebody's father and there's somebody son but they're very driven that's why they're where they are and they're going to, to push their would be talking about personal responsibility and I just kind of click that don't these guys have personal responsibility and the job they take I mean we're talking about okay I make this decision to smoke cigarettes well I'm making this decision to sell cigarettes to people and I know it's going to kill hundreds of thousands of people no matter what you do, Andres you know to ameliorate that that's your personal responsibility you've taken out on yourself to push this product don't they have that so they are in a winter bottom line is money yeah that is so personal responsibility I mean we're talking about making personal choices and having to live with it I think a personal response which is their business relationships what they're doing is, you make your choices yes that's basically it that's what I think but they separate their business sense of responsibility from their million other social sensors possibility I don't know one person do that can't really do it but they do, compartmentalize they're doing there this is a job and they look at it as a job and I'm doing it the best I can and it's like I'm working hard regardless of what the consequences are too there's nothing on who wants to know, as long as there is a demand for the product they're supplying it okay their last question in here the five or so Executives point out and the article with a reporter points out some of the things that Philip Morris is doing different now than they used to do no more bro man no Billboards 30,000 clerks train a hundred million dollars in advertising 35:58 countries that they're they're, stop you smoking in or working to stop these noisy all that kind of stuff okay they're out there doing can these guys ever win or just impossible it's down to what they're pushing with the product isn't it's just has so many bad ramifications to it I mean even if I realized what they may want to do was good you know their company but the bottom line is everybody looks and I guess a lot be a part of that too is this last paid only if I get a chance to read it but it's a, write up about an advertising campaign they're investing it yeah that's talking about denying access to cigarettes hey my seen this commercial yeah I did some reading is it something about a bunch of kids a good job buddy, see this commercial all the time and television and it just happens when I turn it on you know it's on there and I don't know but I've taken note to it so therefore you know the week are things to you and I like you didn't see that three years ago or five years ago so you know I think that they do not try but you know they're like you say they're manipulating they're doing you know they're they're they're taking an inch to get a yard and take my could take some one is that they are trying to address on one level, it'll let children smoke and yet they're planting the seed for children to smoke I think that becomes enticing we serve it in a challenge yeah think about it but all the sudden now you're saying don't do it you shouldn't do it you're planning to see to do it and it becomes I mean I see that I could see that it's not maybe your point but it's kind of how I survived yeah I wasn't looking at it kind of a macho taco whole differently and it reminded me of in, children's Pinocchio when the boys were all LED and they were all donkeys because they played up to half the bridge you know if you follow these ads a seaman tasting and cool and sexy and don't smoke I don't smoke who's gonna tell me not to smoke I'm going to smoke it's cool if you think you're Invincible - I guess that's why I took it while I appreciate you should develop cigarettes for kids that are, to get a yarn if you get one kid not to smoke but 100's do because the concept is it's like it's like, you know I don't know I don't have a good analogy but if you keep telling somebody not to do something not to do something to try to change a tire so that other thing you do is get possibly end up in counterproductive and once again goes back to the whole concept of the Prince of Darkness is where you know maybe somewhere on Park Avenue they know a little bit more than we do or the quote-unquote improves the quality of the advertising people I'm quite certain that when I've seen ads, Brilliant Minds to think how can we act as if the subliminal heart out okay guys I'll tell you what you've been great if you and thank you for doing your homework so leave everything you got right in front of you I'm going to pick it up and you have a very simple Task 1 you go back out the door you came in and see the folks on the way out and, they'll pay you your money for for giving me all the good help and then travel safe going on even the prince of the article there please leave everything place, thank you so you can take your names if you want if you want to remember your name, it's

grhb0039,"ladies and gentlemen the senior vice president of marketing for RJ artist development company David thank you and good morning, as you can see we are all tremendously excited about Premier probably the most talked about eagerly anticipated new cigarette ever, Premier represents an unprecedented opportunity that will even rival the introduction of Winston more than 30 years ago we firmly believe the premier is the first of a new generation of cigarettes that will shape the future of our industry, the dedication the hard work and the plain old sweat of a lot of people in Winston-Salem have made this remarkable product a reality, and now all eyes are on Us sales and marketing to successfully introduced Premiere into the market, Premier represents the biggest technological breakthrough in cigarette history and we intend to Market it as nothing less, now before I tell you about the specifics of our marketing program I'd like to emphasize one key point, the same corporate commitment that is made Premier possible is reflected in the resources dedicated to make this launch a success, in fact the marketing support behind Premier will exceed any new cigarette ever guaranteeing the biggest the most exciting introduction in our company's history, now to put this into perspective we will outspend Marlboro by more than two to one during the launch and I'm sure that you will agree that the marketing elements that you are about to see are dramatic and Powerful tools to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind sales opportunity, with the unique product supported by new and Innovative programs we will be relying heavily on field sales input to optimize our plan we need good information on what's working and what could work better sales and marketing coordination is important with any new brand introduction but it's absolutely Critical with this one, well now for the marketing elements let's first look at the name the name Premier is a great fit for this product Premier literally means first the first of a whole new generation of cigarettes for today's smoker, the package for Premier is also something very special in Consumer Testing the design achieved very high acceptance it exceeded our expectations in communicating the Breakthrough nature of Premier and standing for quality and having broad-based smoker appeal and most important in generating the highest levels of purchase interest, the package is a standard king size box configuration but with a special printed foil over wrap to provide extra moisture protection for the product this high-tech overwrap is unique to Premiere and will further reinforce the brands premium quality and you can see that the carton Graphics effectively translate this exciting design and provide impactful shelf presence for both filter and Menthol styles, well now let's talk pricing, Premier will be priced to achieve a 25 percent premium over standard priced 85 millimeter brands at retail not only is it more expensive to make but we found that smokers expect to pay more for premier, this premium results in an up charge to the consumer of about 30 cents per pack and 275 per carton, all of our marketing elements reflect the value added dimension of the product support equality image and reinforce the technological breakthrough which commands this premium on a national average the retail price for Premier will be a dollar 64 per pack and 1379 per carton prices in both Missouri and Arizona are projected to be comparable to this national average, you know advertising is something that every marketing guy likes to talk about and I'm certainly no exception for mirrors advertising campaign communicates that through the use of innovative new technology Premier is the first cigarette to respond to certain negative perceptions among smokers while still delivering the taste and the satisfaction that smokers demand, our advertising is distinctive to the cigarette industry and it has a newsworthy informational look while maintaining an upbeat and positive tone we have selected the phrase the cleaner smoke as our product positioning because it clearly communicates premiers unique point of difference, very importantly we are not claiming that Premier is a safer cigarette because we do not believe that our current products are unsafe while we don't agree with the claims made about current cigarettes we do take very seriously the controversy which has resulted so we developed Premier to respond to the ever growing pressures confronting today smokers, our media plan guarantees that we will reach virtually every smoker during the launch with this advertising because of our extensive use of magazines newspapers and billboards beginning in mid-september will run a series of pre introductory newspaper ads to announce the new category of cleaner smoke and to build anticipation for the product introduction with the tagline Premier is coming, we will also run pre introductory Billboards and key high traffic locations to build excitement and word-of-mouth around the pending launch, by the week of October 17th when you are achieving broad-scale retail distribution our launch advertising will begin, our initial magazine units are 6 and 4 Page inserts that will run in Major magazines like time Better Homes and Gardens and Sports Illustrated now these units are designed to deliver the full premier advertising message and a very highly impactful and distinctive manner, since we have samples of our advertising for your review after the meeting let me simply summarize the ad copy for you, the introductory message Harold's premiers technological achievement as the first cigarette that heats tobacco rather than burning it the ads convey what this breakthrough means for smokers and those around them specifically a substantial reduction of many of the controversial compounds found in the Smoke of tobacco burning cigarettes smoked the dissipates almost instantly and smoke with a cleaner aroma, what Premier comes down to is cleaner smoke not only for smokers but also for everyone around them but you know we haven't forgotten why people smoke namely taste and enjoyment therefore our ads reinforce the pleasurable aspects of smoking premier, our initial multi-page units will be followed by other four-page units with varying headlines which focus on cleaner smoke and the Breakthrough that it represents, we will also run a number of magazine spreads and full-page newspaper ads to maintain very heavy advertising presence during the launch additionally we will include a question-and-answer booklet with some magazine ads to provide further information about our new cigarette, The Outdoor Advertising that we've created for Premier is dramatic and will generate tremendous presence in your markets the message is simple and straightforward the cleaner smoke new premier a works cited about this advertising because it supports our breakthrough achievement and provides important and unique news to smokers, our introductory campaign generated the highest level of purchase intent of any new RJ our brand advertising ever tested let me tell you something smokers want this product, the bottom line is the advertising is very effective in communicating our message to smokers, well now that you've seen our ads let me tell you about some specifics of our introductory promotions plan, premiers promotion plan is by far the most extensive that we've ever undertaken for a new brand, promotion programs the first of their kind have been developed with four key strategies in mind education acclimation impact and quality education to premieres attributes acclimation to its unique characteristics impact to ensure smoker participation and finally quality to support premiers premium price, all of our promotion programs will carry product information to help educate smokers about premier, smokers will be provided with multiple pack and curtain offers to ensure a sufficient quantity of product to acclimate and switch to Premiere as with any breakthrough product there are some adjustments required by smokers for example Premier has a new cleaner taste a different Aroma and it takes a little longer to light some of you may recall the adjustments required when filters were introduced and later lotar products as you, no today filters represent more than 90% of the market and low tar more than fifty percent, we're confident that one smokers understand premiers attributes consumer acceptance will parallel these earlier industry advances, to achieve the greatest impact priority emphasis has been given to retail promotion furthermore Direct Mail programs are targeted exclusively against competitive smokers to maximize incremental volume and finally every promotion that we've developed carries a very high-quality look to ensure that it's a step above anything else currently out there, to help you dominate the retail environment we have developed the most extensive display program ever conducted on a Reynolds new brand, these specially designed retail displays reinforce the cleaner smoke concept and provide a high-value permanent look, these displays have been set up for your review following the meeting, the displays will showcase our very lucrative introductory offer in October now this offer consists of two free packs with a 2-pack purchase and will also contain an informational brochure a three dollar retail Bearer cheque to encourage repeat purchase a quality butane lighter and a cigarette case that will hold a pack of Premier plus 5 you cigarettes for easy disposal, also at the recommendation of sales planning we have boosted the normal month one quantity to ensure that you have enough promotional product to work with, now one month to we will load our supplemental displays with regular product to coincide with a strong Direct Mail effort that I'll cover in just a moment in month through month 3 we will repeat the by to get two free promotion with the three dollar Bearer cheque now it's particularly important that we educate retailers on the Redemption of Bearer cheques while smokers use them just like coupons they are not coupons their checks that should be cached by the retailer, for immediate payment at Banks importantly we will use the bearer cheques to rapidly generate the names of tires for use and follow-up promotions the checks will also provide immediate feedback on how well our promotion programs are working, to supplement trial building programs at retail product sampling will be conducted in October and November using the premier sampling centers these centers will be positioned in high traffic locations and will deliver product information via brochures and a special video, smokers will be provided with a complimentary sample containing four packs this offer will also contain the same elements as the retail introductory offer I previously described an extremely lucrative free sample, certainly a key promotion for us during launches the targeted Direct Mail program and impactful brochure containing a coupon for a free carton of Premier will be used to maximize trial and conversion among competitive smokers particularly smokers of Philip Morris brands, we will achieve tremendous penetration with this program almost half of all target competitive smokers in the lead markets will receive this free carton offer and in order to promote word-of-mouth advertising and new trial we have developed what we call a direct mail Advocate Program, we have found through consumer tests that there is a core group of smokers out there that have immediate and strong acceptance of the product and these people want to tell their friends about Premier to leverage this Core Group commitment we developed an Innovative program that enables these smokers to give their friends a coupon good for two free packs of premiere, as I'm sure you know the personal endorsement from a friend is one of the most powerful marketing tools available, finally to further consumer understanding product information and instructions for use will be contained in pack on certs and carton inserts that will be included in all product during the test Market, let me add that we will be testing several alternative retail and Direct Mail promotions this will enable us to optimize our plans for later expansions these tests will be reviewed in your breakout meetings but let me re-emphasize the need for feedback from the field on how these programs are working, in summary our extensive promotion plan will ensure tremendous trial and purchase of new premier and support our market share objectives, well as you can see companies support and commitment to Premiere is unprecedented we've developed and will implement the most aggressive marketing program ever undertaken by our Jr, premiers breakthrough achievement and obvious competitive Advantage warrant nothing less, Premier represents the future and we must introduce it accordingly, as I said earlier all eyes are on us now Advocates and foes alike or watching the competition is watching our customers are eagerly awaiting our new cigarette, let's show them that we are indeed the leaders in this industry thank you",0.8652403622580644,0.7325503,0.9128387,grhb0039,,tobacco;

gsbg0182,"good morning I would like to take a minute or two to discuss a subject that is vitally important to all of us I'm talking of course about the annual free gift that we send to every TSM, your basic ball and your basic bat or a big hit with the field sales force, and the question that's been keeping us up nights here in New York City is how do we top that, basic boxing gloves no research showed that it's difficult to put up POS materials with these fat thumbs, your basic hard hat it could come in handy when those competitive shears come crashing down but we decided against it, this year we wanted to give you something you could really use and that's why we decided on this watch later on you'll each be getting one of these why because basic and good timing or the subjects of this meeting, before we talk about our present opportunities and our future plans let's revisit the past for a moment, at the beginning of 1994 we thought basic could live with that instant price Gap in fact we discovered that we could live with a much larger price Gap, that Gap is proof positive that every one of you in the field sales force is doing a great job at executing our strategy, your achievement is even more impressive when you consider the tough challenges we faced in 1995 time and time again in 95 you met those challenges you did more than just Prevail against tough odds you excelled, yes we've come a long way in 95 Marlboro is barreling along the tracks with the increasing momentum of marble and limited are other premium brands are showing strength as well, and in the discount category our number two brand basic is doing very well, since January of 95 Basics category Shear is up 1.5 sharepoint's that's terrific especially when you consider that basic is promoted on image and not on price, and now 1995 is behind us it's a new year with new opportunities and new challenges, let me begin 1996 wishing you all a Happy New Year and also by sharing with you some very good news, we are introducing basic and three new king size box packings full flavor lights and full flavor menthol, basic box will be launched nationally over the next four months, that's a big box but then basic box is big news, judging from the number of requests we've had for this packing from you the field sales force I know basic box is going to be a welcome addition to the Philip Morris product line, I also know that some of you may be asking why now why basic box first thing out of the gate in the new year, I'm here to tell you that I'm absolutely convinced that now is the time for basic box, there are four reasons, one take a look at the top 10 brands basic is the only brand in that top 10 without a box packing, nine out of ten top brands all have box that alone sends a very clear message about the right way to go consumers want a box packing, are two major competitors Doral and GPC have box packings however we should note that they don't have box packings and Menthol where they have two strong premium Brands cool and Salem, to now is the right time to introduce a new packing to the discount franchise because the overall discount category is continuing to decline, I'm aware that there are real concerns out there and the argument goes something like this, Dave we're a premium based company we can be very successful focusing on the premium side of the business, aren't you afraid this new packing could in fact generate new discount growth, no the fact is that discount box packings have been growing for the past two years within a total category decline so those fears are ungrounded three now is the time for basic box because even in a shrinking discount category we are growing our share, as I said earlier basic is up 1.5 category Shear points since January, let's not forget that basic is also a major brand its number two in our portfolio only exceeded by the most successful brand in consumer products history more burro, yes we are doing great on the premium side let's use that momentum at retail to make basic and even bigger success, the fact is there are a lot of discount consumers out there who are making purchase decisions based on something other than absolute Rock Bottom price for now is a time for basic box because an absolute sheer Basics performance has been flat we're doing well but Doral and GPC are outpacing us, in a shrinking category these two competitors are growing faster than basic, in other words the introduction of basic box is a smart move for the future as well as for right now, we've been talking about the why of basic box the next question is how how or are we going to launch this brand, with a sound strategy and outstanding execution, a product launch is unique because you only get one shot at doing it right, let's make the most of this terrific opportunity to seize the attention of consumers and pull competitive smokers into the brand, we plan to make the most of our time right now so we can execute with Excellence from the word go, when we talked with their consumers the number one thing they tell us is that they want to find the product everywhere, in other words distribution is key our first priority will be to get distribution the goal we've set for ourselves nationally is 80% of anyone packing, in support of your hard work will be running basic box creative on billboards and magazines during the month of February, as a result we expect consumers to go into the stores and early February asking for the product, during the month of February we will be offering a buy two get one free on all soft packings but not on basic Bots we're not putting box in the February promotion because we want to make everyone we want to make sure that everyone has enough time to get distribution, we'll follow February's promotion with a box specific promotion a buy two get one free for basic box in the first two weeks of March, in addition will be dropping 60 million buy two get one free coupons in newspapers across the country this will introduce basic box to the smoking public, will also drop three million pieces of mail out to both basic and competitive smokers, it's a fact that we've always supported basic 11 to 12 months out of every year now with basic box we are seizing a terrific opportunity to promote the brand like never before, we've all heard the expression time is money, let's make the most of our time these first few months of 1996 so that we can be right on the money with basic box time and time again you have demonstrated an ability to successfully meet new challenges now is it time for all of us to begin to make big things happen for basic box, checking my basic watch I see it's time to turn this over to the host of your meeting who will take you through the specifics of this introduction as it relates to your own sales territory, have a good meeting and good selling",0.875473053148148,0.7370034,0.9128387,gsbg0182,,tobacco; cigarette;  <a

everything you want Oh may I have a cup of coffee please you're not out of coffee no we have some coffee yes I'll have a cognac please no have you got some very bizarre no I'll have a sous if you've got it or maybe you're a Seuss, decisions decisions decisions decisions and that's what's called consumer Choice why do people choose a certain brand like a lot of things it's not as simple as you think I am that is are not simple but I'm not complicated yes you are you're very complicated for instance you're made up of 27 different elements and you've got more brain cells than there are stars in space familiar things often turn out to be much more complicated than you imagine, that's fascinating you seem to know an awful long time would you have rather might take these cigarettes for instance have you ever thought how complex a pack of cigarettes he has no the wrapping reflects heat and acts as a gas barrier to keep oxygen and water vapor out Aroma and freshness in the stiff pack is a mechanical barrier to prevent damage and then there's a cigarette, out there in Richmond Virginia Philip Morris have a huge modern research and development organization employing five hundred scientists covering every aspect of tobacco Science and Technology like analysis of tobacco the chemistry and physics of smoke Research into flavors and filter materials and design of new processes for better use of tobacco materials,and there's another research and development center in Switzerland agnosia tell run by Philip Morris Europe why well sign shouldn't work in a vacuum ideas grow from the people they serve the customers, well there are local markets and opportunities in Europe that are different from America, local regulations May create technical problems calling for new products and methods of production and there are local tastes and preferences what appeals to one country may not appeal to another though nowadays people are swinging more and more towards the well-known International brands of cigarettes, but even then cigarettes are manufactured locally in Europe and the ingredients are not only tobacco but paper filters blue inks and flavors all the things that make up a pack of cigarettes have to be monitored to maintain quality and consistency, have you ever thought what happens when you smoke a cigarette yes it's very enjoyable, there's more to it than you think the customer buys a cigarette butt consume smoke it's rather like making tea, well you need second operator some methods to obtain a satisfactory end result with skill and attention to detail you can blend all the ingredients in different subtle ways to get results which are aesthetically appealing as well as tasting nice the cigarette is a subtle piece of mechanical and thermodynamic engineering it consists basically of a porous paper tube containing a loose, Lynette Rod of organic material that is tobacco which will burn at a constant rate producing enough heat to release its constituent compounds, a lot of research and developments work is concerned with cigarette technology how the various elements interact with a cigarette is smoked when you light a cigarette and puff a whole sequence of events begins you draw air through the burning cone which Rises to a temperature of 900 degrees Centigrade at the highest temperature everything is burnt but two centimeters away the tobacco temperature is hardly above room temperature, at the lower temperatures Vapors are released producing Aroma and taste between 250 and 400 degrees less volatile substances are converted by a process called pyrolysis into Vapors which mostly condense into tiny droplets you see these as smoke, while traveling from the hot to the cool end gases Escape From The Smoke through the paper and air is drawn in mixing with the droplets and aromatic Vapors to arrive at the tip as cool mainstream smoke at the end of the puff the temperature of the burning comb falls back to about 600 Degrees and the whole system ticks over releasing sidestream smoke waiting for the process to be repeated, in the western world or commercial tobacco is descended from a plant called La Cocina to back mmm once it's harvested there are different methods of curing the tobacco well outside in the air or sun or in curing barns heated with hot air through flues, Modern cigarette length are made from four basic types of tobacco right Virginia tobacco medium life-sized and flue-cured forming the bulk of every cigarette, Bernie large leave Dan are cured, Maryland closely related to Burley tobacco's very popular in parts of Europe and also are cured, and Oriental tobacco which is much smaller leaved cured in the Sun and highly aromatic of course tobacco is a natural crop affected by natural hazards but customers expect every pack of their chosen brand to taste the same European cigarettes are made from 30 or so varieties of tobacco from all over the world samples are taken from each Consignment and distributed to the Laboratories so that chemical characteristics all flavors can be analyzed in order, to serve as a basis for well-defined blending, hand-rolled cigarettes from each lot will be Smoked by experts feel sense of taste is as highly developed as wine tasters,in the laboratory the tobacco is ground to powder and subjected to chemical analysis to find out its dominant characteristics, the samples can be analyzed in many different ways in tobacco and smoke chemistry for example Philip Morris pioneered the use of gas chromatography that sounds very complicated it's a method of separating a mixture of compounds which can be vaporized into its various constituents it consists quite simply of a very fine coiled tube usually made of glass or stainless steel which has a pure carrier gas flowing through it constantly and at a precisely controlled temperature, distributed throughout the coil you have a porous adsorbent at one end you inject the liquid mixture of compounds this vaporizes immediately in the Heat and the vapor is carried by the gas through the coil, since each of the constituents of the mixture has different chemical and physical properties some will be more slow down by the adsorbent than others, so they move through the coil at different speeds, so you squirt the mixture in at one end and by the intensity of the signal given off by each compound at the other end you can read off the different constituents, the automatic smoking machine was designed and built by Philip Morris in the United States the chemical composition of smoke mustn't change over time in a cigarette which is very difficult to maintain in a natural product so every blend component has to be tested to find out what it will contribute, smoke compounds from the machine are trapped on a filter subsequently weighed transferred into solution and analyzed by the machine automatically, the Auto Analyzer uses classical chemistry but automate the various steps for instance you take a series of samples inject them into the system where they are separated by bubbles then you add a reagent which colors the substance you want to detect the samples are pumped through a detector to measure the degree of coloration which is proportional to the concentration at the end of the sequence there's an automatic printer show, the percentage of the substance nicotine or whatever that you want to measure, then there's the flavor kitchen the flavor Kitchen yes well the most markets flavors are added to the tobacco to highlight certain characteristics like adding spice to food, you'd be surprised at the number of delicious things they put into most cigarettes chocolate licorice sugar and honey to complement the tobacco's natural Aroma and taste the solution of mainly sweet ingredients which is added hot at the beginning of tobacco preparation is called casing whereas Aroma top notes added towards the end after the cutting of the tobacco are called after cut flavors and of course these ingredients have to be checked constantly for Purity and strength before they are mixed with the Blended tobacco, the factory they're all natural ingredients from different parts of the world so there's subject variables, quality control is continuous if the samples tested don't reach very exact standards a whole batch may be rejected, once the quality of the ingredients is approved they can be introduced into the tobacco, each brand has its own special recipe which is a closely guarded secret and some Brands don't contain any additives, mass production methods have been brought to a high level of Technology over the years but there will always be room for improvements which reminds me there's also a department called process development they generate new ideas for processing the tobacco, what to do with tobacco fines and stems for instance, it's quite a bit left over in the manufacturing process or perfectly good tobacco so they've developed process for reconstituting these ingredients into homogenized sheet, leading in turn to the development of new Machinery to manufacture the product on an industrial scale so that it can be blended into the rest of the tobacco since this reconstituted tobacco sheet has been modified to exclude natural deficiencies its introduction actually improves the blend as well as making economic sense and every little saving helps particularly when you think that at the factory at measure tell alone they manufacture 17 million cigarettes a day,as you said cigarettes aren't only made of tobacco right look at the paper for instance that's a whole different story there are many different sorts of paper with different characteristics, constant checks are made on all the materials the whiteness of the paper its Purity porosity burning rate and strength, and of course the glues and inks used in printing and packaging all have to be tested as well it's very important when high speed machines are producing 100 cigarettes a second, and when it's finished products have passed every quality control samples are tested again in the Laboratories to make sure that no Faults have got through but in the final analysis there is no substitute for the human touch, one point I haven't mentioned is the filter do you know how a Filter Works yes I think so well you probably don't it sound like a sieve which stops all substances over a certain size from passing through a well-designed cigarette filter should have a selective filtering effect covering the whole range of smoke constituents the basic white filter is really a bundle of cellulose acetate fibers wrapped in paper which is more or less porous according to design, smoke is an aerosol composed of various gases aromatic Vapors and condensed droplets a proportion of these droplets are attracted by capillary action to the fibers and the gas is an aromatic Vapors are largely unaffected, cuz I know they've been experimenting with filters for a long time yes I know but nowadays they've developed beyond the basic white filter the research department for instance is developing granular filters further in detail cigarette smoke can be broken down into eight percent aromatic Vapors eight percent organic substance in droplets an 84% are the gases the biggest proportion being nitrogen from the air the more sophisticated filters contain granules with especially, activated porous surface which can capture a specific part of the volatile organic materials contained in the vapors according to required taste so that none of the smokes constituents become dominant the most sophisticated filters combine a mechanical White Fiber filter and mixtures of activated granules to produce a balanced smoke, the research Department studies amongst other things the whole field of adsorbent materials that are mainly active on the volatile Vapor phase, the aim is to produce an efficient filter which ensures that the same time a proper balance of taste the problem is if you reduce one element another element may become dominant perhaps affecting The Taste activated charcoal one of the most effective absorbance whether it's very large surface area and micro porous structure is selected for volatile components which may have a sharp taste the research Department uses Advanced scientific methods in their work, which involves the basic constituents of cigarette technology tobacco smoke additives that's to say everything else that goes into a cigarette and they've got a lot of sophisticated machines to help them thus automatic for instance automatically gathers data on pore size and poor distribution of absorbance for filter cigarettes they must have collected an awful lot of information by now you're absolutely right well there are, you two terminals through our D which are linked to a data processing center, all relevant information not only from our D itself but from available sources anywhere in the world is stored in a library staff by specialists in information storage and retrieval it's instantly available to any of the Departments when the forms of books journals reprints and visual display, I've told you about quality control about process development and the research Department there's one honor Department initiative product development, they drawn all the information made available by the other departments and dream up new concepts of their own which they store away for the future or offer to the marketing department, on the other hand the marketing people frequently request a specific new product or alterations to existing ones, this can range from changing a filter design to creating an entirely new cigarette brand,a change which might appear to be simple such as altering filter length by a millimeter move dozens of different experimental cigarettes being produced and tested because you may have to adapt the tobacco blend cigarette paper or other ingredients to compensate for the change, but however many machines you may use to test the quality of tobacco in the construction of cigarettes in the end there is only one way of deciding if you like a cigarette smoke yes, as I said before the customer buys a cigarette butt consumes smoke smoking a cigarette is rather like drinking tea apart from the purely aesthetic gratification the look and the aroma and taste there are measurable responses such as pulse rate and skin temperature so you find out how people smoke, ultimately you can forget all about the machines and simply let people smoke and give their opinions, the final decisions about cigarettes are really made by a smoking panel of people drawn from the leaf Department of Philip Morris Europe, they decide if a cigarette is worth smoking they look for those subtle quality characteristics which can't be chemically analyzed, as a routine quality control they test smoke whenever a new batch of ingredients is introduced into production looking particularly for Taste and flavor character but the smoking panel is also the final judge of new products the ultimate aim in producing any brand of cigarettes is to maintain consistency of character from one pack to another from the first puff to the last, research and development can show how to achieve this, well there you are that's more or

Paul has this report, when Minnesota began this anti-smoking campaign in 1986 it was aimed chiefly a teenagers about 1 in 5 teens smoke cigarettes today remember smoking is just as a natural for you as it is for them, even though it's declined sharply among adults the teen smoking rate has held steady for the past decade experts say the traditional messages emphasizing Health consequences or death simply haven't worked for young people, Sunshine Dayglo began smoking four years ago when she was 12 she just moved to st. Paul from a small town and all her friends she says seem to be smoking I think it was being new in town and you always find some way to click in with your friends and it had been just normal like you dress a certain way or you find things that kind of are easy an easy Outlet to get in you know be accepted with your friends and whatever, I'm an honor student Sunshine Dayglo says she's well aware of smoking's adverse consequences but intelligence and even a mild asthma problem aren't enough to overcome the Habit one that her mother Kathy back cell says began because of peer pressure and teenage rebellion my mother smoked and so I thought that my rebellion was to not smoke and no now we've skipped a generation and now he's rebelling by smoking why do wrong and whatever the cause experts say the earlier in life, if a person decides to smoke the tougher it becomes later to quit people who start smoking in college for example find it much easier to take the Habit so in addition to urging kids not to smoke anti-smoking campaigns have also tried to prevent them from buying cigarettes in the first place our say what I mean it more difficult for me to buy them because then I met would have stopped and thought about it you know before, I knew what I was getting into, to make it more difficult for young people to buy cigarettes many states are considering a ban on vending machines which allow many children easy access to cigarettes it's a move endorsed at the federal level by Health and Human Services secretary dr. Louis Sullivan the tobacco industry has joined vendors in opposing the ban spokesman walk a merryman notes that despite very tight restrictions on alcohol sales underage drinking is widespread two-thirds of high school students are, drinkers only about 14% are regular smokers so the issue of access it seems to me simply doesn't play into this at all how old are you 15 holy smoke inertia despite industry opposition the Saint Paul suburb of White Bear Lake band the machines this year it has launched one of the toughest crackdowns on underage smoking in the nation police regularly arrest and put, through smoking cessation classes any minor caught in the act this goes to our juvenile officer okay and what you'll do is mail a letter out your parents within two weeks and your parents are going to be required to come down and visit with the juvenile officer what what what because it's illegal to smoke under the age 18 in the state of Minnesota despite the Crackdown it's not difficult for kids in White Bear Lake to buy or smoke cigarettes they can simply go to a neighboring Community for, example like st. Paul there we followed Sunshine Day go one recent afternoon to this gas station recording her conversation and purchased with a concealed wireless microphone although Minnesota recently enacted the strictest penalties in the nation up to three thousand dollars anyone caught selling to minors of 15 year old female can purchase cigarettes about six times out of 10 according to a, diversity of Minnesota study dr. Gene Forrester of the University of Minnesota School of Public Health says most police departments don't see Teen smoking as an urgent priority we had a police team at one time tell us you know nobody nobody dies from cigarettes well that's a blatantly wrong but what he means nobody's dying they're not teenagers dying today from cigarette he's clearly used to dealing with issues that have a more immediate impact, recall any of them we went back to the st. Paul gas station a few minutes after Sunshine Day gloated nineteen-year-old attendant denied he told her cigarettes he said he regularly checks the idea Penny one who appears under 18 that bitch but then I say it's a compliment if they're all nothing Hearts compliment you ever feel pressured at all, and embarrassed to ask people for ID sometimes like if it's a nice-looking girl what are you doing those cases kind of asked shyly it's not just retail clerks who asked shyly on the matter of teen smoking however experts say many parents are reluctant to resist their teenage smokers I don't like it and I let her know I don't like it but I guess I know there are bigger issues, in her life right now that if I put a lot of negative energy and making her quit smoking she's may just rebelling other areas that they could have a worse impact on her life the fact that parents go along with their children's decision to smoke is demoralizing to anti-smoking Advocates but Kathy Xcel says in her mind there are many worse things her daughter could engage in I'm really concerned about her sexual activity alcohol addiction would be another concern I have, the use of drugs and substances that are, more immediately harmful than cigarettes might be to her body and grades in college and those kinds of issues are are certainly more pressing right now and that that if there can be a bad back burner issue I think it's smoking as anti-smoking Advocates trouble to keep their issue on the front burner and estimated 3,000 teenagers each day starts smoking cigarette sales to minors bring in over 1 billion dollars a year in profits, to the tobacco industry and ironically even more money in excise tax revenue to government",0.8491557771428573,0.71282685,0.9128387,gxwk0146,,tobacco; cigarette;<a href='http://www.archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&mediatype=movies&collection=industry-archives'>Browse by keywords in UCSF industry videos</a>,"MACNEIL/LEHRER NEWSHOUR: TEEN SMOKING, WETA-TV, PBS, WASHINGTON, DC",

Reynolds as you smoke your eclipse the heat barrier keeps the tobacco roll from burning down inside the cigarette instead when you draw warm air passes over the tobacco getting a just hot enough to, create a full-bodied smoke it carries the flavor of the tobacco with it let's put it in English the way Eclipse works is something like making coffee when you pour the hot water all the flavors release from the grounds the ground is still there when you finish but all the flavors gone so yet us them when you're done guys don't toss your clip still it seems cool down mention Eclipse taste, tinkle body but it's super low and tar nicotine no well let's hear all about it from the folks at r.j. Reynolds themselves based on Government testing methods full flavor cigarette Styles range between 15 and 20 milligrams of tar Lifestyles between 6 and 14 and ultralights between 1 and 5 mg but Eclipse which primarily Heats rather than Burns tobacco is three milligrams in its full flavor style and to in its mild style for, nicotine full flavor cigarettes typically range between point eight and one point seven milligrams of nicotine lights range between .6 and .9 and ultralights range between point 1 and point five but eclipses nicotine level is just point to mg in its full flavor and point one and it's mild style and that's our math lesson for today seriously here's the bottom line Eclipse taste great is ultra low and tar and nicotine, the smoke disappears super fast and there's a huge reduction in secondhand smoke why how it's because the clip smoke is different from other cigarettes smoke particles from other cigarettes are about 20% of water and glycerin put Eclipse Smoke is the reverse about 80% water and Glycerine glycerine is something found in all cigarette smoke as well as many food products and baked goods the smoke is mostly water and glycerin there's almost no, poke off the lid and so no wonder there's so little secondhand smoke but is there anything in the Smoke of an eclipse that isn't in other cigarettes nope just more water and glycerin that's why all I smell are the flowers and why clip smoked a super smooth and disappear super fast just like I used to have to whatever I this cigarette of course the real deal is Eclipse is a little different at first oh yes it is a real cigarette it's a great tasting real, cigarette it's not a cigarette alternative or any of that kind of stuff but you do sort of have to get used to it in the beginning but for me that's all part of discovering something so new and wonderful all right then let's give it a whirl first and foremost we need a good strong flame when you light it get you the car lighter you need a direct flame and you need to take an extra puffer to when you light it that's because you lighting the carbon tip not the tobacco, now you already know Eclipse has no ashes because it doesn't burn down like your cigarette does that mean Eclipse doesn't last as long no way eclipse last just as long as my old cigarette about six or seven minutes I know I timed, another thing I discovered with the cliffs the best flavor comes from regular gentle pops now if you let it sit for a while the tip make cool down but not so worried and extra pop will get it going again and when you start getting less smoke and The Taste gets weaker that's how you know your Clips is just about done, there's no question about it Eclipse really is a whole new world for a smoker's now some of the great things like no ashes he discover right away others we appreciate after a while like one day maybe you take out your favorite sweater for me it's the one I was wearing when Bill proposed and guess what no cigarette odor or you walk into the house and it smells clean and fresh or you in your car smoking a Clifton you realize, wow I'm smoking with the windows up I didn't even notice here's another thing you'll discover the freedom you have when you smoke an eclipse so now I can't end the My Little Darlings without being tied to an ashtray but you know you really won't see how great a Clips can be if you keep smoking your old Bram so hang with the clips exclusively for a week or so and you'll see the difference would I, Barbara steer you wrong but you don't have to take my word for it listen to this okay when I first took the eclipse home I said you are not going to believe this cigarette well this is what I wanted this is exactly what I was hoping for there was just no smoke lingering in the air it was just unbelievable I took it close to work and I took it down to our smokers room and the other smokers in the room were amazed, with the cliffs I can smell my wife's perfume or whatever she might be cooking at night I don't see you having to paint once a year the inside of your house because it's getting yellow to me is reduction of the tar and nicotine in the cigarette is by far one of the best reasons is more enjoyable than a regular cigarette that's the honest truth when I smoke let's it makes me feel free to enjoy, my cigarette without offending the non-smokers I would say would definitely be one of the only Innovative cigarettes I've ever heard of well that's the story about an incredible new cigarette called eclipse and incredible new cigarette that gives you all the pleasure of smoking without all the secondhand smoke, there's no lingering odor almost no stains no ashes and low low tar and nicotine all in a full-body smoke with super taste who knows with Eclipse Bibby marriages All Over America will get better maybe it'll be the dawn a new day of Harmony across this great land maybe chocolate will spin your lies okay so that was a little overboard truth is it will always be people out there who won't, like that cigarette in your hand period but for the people you like the people you want to be around for you eclipse is a real step forward well I could go on and on but I don't have to aren't you lucky because you've got a fact-filled brochure that came with this video it talks about eclipses in more detail and answers the most commonly asked questions check it out it's short and informative like mate well it's time to say adios just when you thought you couldn't get enough, funny but hey you can always call the folks at r.j. Reynolds whenever you want just pick up a phone when you have questions or just want to share your thoughts about how great Eclipse really is the call is free so give him a shout, and hey tell them Barbers engine they just love me down there surgeon general's warning smoking causes lung cancer heart disease emphysema and they complicate pregnancy",0.8569523993103447,0.75848067,0.91283906,gyhb0039,,tobacco; cigarette;<a href='http://www.archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&mediatype=movies&collection=industry-archives'>Browse by keywords in UCSF industry videos</a>,ECLIPSE A WHOLE NEW WORLD FOR SMOKERS DISCOVER A NEW FREEDOM TO ENJOY SMOKING.

and a summary of our achievements and our future challenges and opportunities and now I will turn the meeting over to Bill Campbell our Executive Vice President of marketing built thank you Fred progress is defined by Webster as forward or onward movement although this meaning suits our purposes we'll we primarily chose it as art, a theme for its Dynamic nature in today's marketing environment progress in the cigarette business isn't decided merely by momentum or side although we have achieved sales share and profit leadership we remain dedicated to include improving both our strategic and tactical marketing the strengthening our Market position on a macro level 1985 was largely a successful year, property continued their Superior growth while unit sales and market share grew and a shrinking market place however sales and share growth did not reach historical levels in 1985 therefore we must look critically at our results in detail this examination reveals some areas where we successfully met our objectives somewhere we are stabilizing or Shoring up our position somewhere we missed them, work and some were the jury is still out I will highlight these four areas now and a labor elaborate on them later in the hour our complete success Mentor who has played both Grandpa move eyes and unit sales and market share and both Brands benefit from a permissible contributions by line extensions closely take the second area we are working, going to stabilize weaknesses in Merit and Benson & Hedges we have subjected both Brands to rigorous analysis and are implementing new marketing program to further stabilize our overall business we are building competitive positions in the growing price value segment and its sales and Merchandising, we are committed to turning a major factor in these two areas we entered the price value category last year with the test marketing and subsequent National Rollout of players like 25 we are also entering into direct competition with generics and Darrell using our Cambridge trademark, turning to sales and Merchandising p.m. USA has made a long-term commitment to retail leadership in the cigarette system, three of those urgent issues facing p.m. USA during the next five years or addressing the imbalance of current part of our market share and share of inventory securing adequate she'll present and reducing out of stars, we have recently expanded and reorganize our Field Force and built up our in-store merchandising with new cigarette cartons and package fixtures and related retail payment programs, well we have had some significant successes we continue to substantially leg or if they are in retail Domino's our challenge for the future the third area for close examination is the medical business where we continue to fall short of our goal the under status Factory 17 percent share of the Menthol segment has been a perennial problem for p.m. USA we have not been able to successfully launch, a competitive non Learning Station menthol, the last area is the area where results are not final the jury is still out but two brains now in test markets Concord and dugdale is the unique cigarette that allows the smoker to dial these tourist flavor load done you know you can upscale entry with an international heritage, both Concord and DuckTales are showing pockets of strength and weakness currently we're adjusting our marketing strategy in light of the Brand's performances and consumer research I will talk it for the length about our new products towards the end of this presentation at this time I'd like to introduce John Zoeller director of market research who will review the current market trade John will be followed by Robert, Ellenberger do our group directors of brand management before John starts I would like to indicate that we're having some Murphy's laws problems join us pray everything that is going wrong we're having a few problems but we'll just carry on the continent the show is intact the computer has unfortunately let us down at a rather crucial moment so we'll carry on its fight, and rock a rehearsal and we have a video tapes of equipment we have video tapes of this morning's rehearsal sales trends for the industry of Philip Morris, first let's briefly examine the industry's performance, the final months of 1985 shipments were erratic due to the uncertainty surrounding the sun setting of the 16th a pack Federal excise tax this situation was temporarily resolved in late December that the tax was extended March 15 1986, at about the same time Street instituted a price increase, the counter balancing effect these two events than a small additional trade inventory accumulation, nevertheless total shipments fell five billion units to 595 billion in 1985 this was a loss of point eight percent, analyzing the industry's Dynamics while the adult population has been growing about 1.1 percent annually smoking incidents and consumption per day continue to decrease slightly, the overall impact is a reduction in retail sales, consumer sales as measured by Nielsen we're down about 1% last year's low and this rate of decline is expected to continue in the near term, now we'll take a look at Philip Morris, the 1985 p.m. sales had a record two hundred thirteen point six billion 2 billion units over 1984, Philip Morris USA is consistent progress over the years is besting comparison to competition, our 1985 sales volume increased of 2 billion units contrast with the loss of seven billion incurred by all the other companies combined in the past five years we have grown 22 billion views while competition has fallen forty four billion how did each company do last year, in 1985 r.j. Reynolds had a 31.9 market shift which was a point three improvement over the previous year Gretel share growth was entirely due to Durrell which has become the lowest price cigarette on the market in fact without Durrell or Jr with experience to share loss during the past several years Reynolds has been trading high-margin volume for low-margin quality, 1983 is price value brands of grown 8 billion units, while it's full price entries have followed six billion this full price loss has occurred despite spending an estimated 425 million on couponing merchandising and sales promotion activities, for the first time in four years Ron and Williamson enjoyed a here game, it's 11.8 market share was they have Shear Point Advance over 1984 BMW is value entries including their generic private label line and Richland 25 were responsible for the sheer increase, however every full price BMW brand suffered losses since 1983 the BMW price value entries grew 11 billion but it's full price Brands drop 10 billion years, lick it dropped from a 5.7 marketshare 1984 24.9 this year it's older brands are still losing ground and look it's generics feel a new competitive pressure 4.0 23.4 share, for large 8.0 Shear was slightly under its 1984 level while Newport remains a strong performer its gains were unable to compensate for the losses of Kent and the rest of the Lord Lyon, American followed the downward Trend it's been on for over 20 years and slip point four to seven and a half share, other Carlton was unchanged the other American brands declined, the 1985 Philip Morris USA extended its trend of annual market share increases p.m. hit a record share 35.9 the point six year game with the largest of any cigarette company, while our shared growth is lower than in recent years it's still notable as it was accomplished without substantial participation in the low price low-margin cycle, now I'd like to recap 1985 most significance Marketplace development, the low tourist with the 49 share showed virtually no growth in the full flavors with the 45 shared of also level the only lotar Brands to show any upward movements for the price value of packing and our own Marlboro Lights, the ultra-low Taurus is stabilized at 10% of the total Market, of the 20 leading Brands 1985 only five displayed by tally, Barbara continue to improve its number one position which points nine market share game Newport remains robust and headache point or share Advanced Virginia Slims at a point to share hit among the lower price Brands both derail and BMW generics at share gains a point eight, 72 the brand leaders were basically collect plus or minus 1/10 Bashir points remaining Brands were done between point 2 and point seven led by liggett's generic decline, as has been true for some time the success rate of new freestanding cigarette brands is extremely low in 1984 1985 11 new brands were introduced into test Market, three of these all price value entries when nationally, many of the others have already been withdrawn from the market and none of those remaining in test markets currently justifies the National Rollout, indeed among the 12 new brands nationally long since 1980 16 have curved market shares greater than half point with one exception every one of these brands of the price value entry the sole exception Berkeley has been declining systems introduction, foremost Marketplace development of 1985 and the past several years has been the vigorous expansion of the price value segments, this category consists of the lowest price generic brands including No-Frills Brands and store brain for several years Liggett was the only major suppliers products, amid 1984 Brian Williams and launched a competing line of generics, an orgy of rentals reposition Darrell as a generic entry, by December 1985 severe competition cause the generic price brand to sell for two dollars and seventy cents less per Carton and full priced ones, collectively they had a 6.0 market share which was a game at one point to SharePoint, Doral which sells about 50% of its volume of money off coupon has been showing the most growth, the second major price value components to the value 25s these brands are consumers interested in brand name quality as well as cost savings, pedals introduce Century in mid-1983 that was followed by Run & Williamson's Richmond in June 1985 and by Philip Morris is players like 25 and December, the value 25 is achieved a 1.3 market share, in some in 1985 the entire price value category including the generic price and the value 25 entries reached a market share 7.3 1.7 share points, although this segment size and growth are oppressive profitability is low, The Sixteen dollar and fifty cent per thousand profit margins for the full price brands for exci be estimated as all are 52 270 margins of the generics however the value 25 do have respectful margins of between 750 and 11:45, the growth of the price value segment is taking its toll on the full price of brain from 1982 to 1985 price value brand volume grows from 6 billion to forty three billion units at the same time the full price brand declined nearly 65 billion to five hundred fifty two billion units, first it is extremely difficult for any full price brand to show growth, a secret company's performance traditionally has been measured on market share, but with the greater importance of the price value segments along but it's lower profitability other performance criteria must be examined, each company 1985 market share has already been discussed, this differs from each company share of the full price segments, notice that while Philip Morris is a 35.9 market share is 38.5 shareable price segment at The Other Extreme Liggett has a four point nine market share but only a one and a half full price year, marketing expenditure strategies as well as multiple price levels can dramatically affect business comparisons, if we look in detail at only the tube leading cigarette companies, is Phillip Morris has 53 percent of the combined unit sales versus Reynolds 47, our 54 percent of the combined revenues reflects the fact that Reynolds has more low-priced business a major reversal occurs when we look at marketing expenditures r.j. Reynolds substantially I spend Philip Morris and Merchandising and coupon, consequently p.m. accounts for only forty four percent of marketing expenditures, in terms of operating income to spread between ourselves and rentals were right, as a result of favorable price mix and lower marketing expenditures USA enjoyed 62% of the two companies operating income of course one of the primary reasons for the difference in the various performance measures between our sales and rentals is moral growth, Robert Roper route brand director will highlight the Brand's 1985 activities and accomplishments like John bulbar oh Philip Morris USA Flagship Fred continue to strong growth expanded its International industry dominance in 1985 the brand grew by 4.3 billion units to a hundred and thirty-three point three billion units an increase of 3.4% this increases Market, here by nearly a full SharePoint 22.4 while the full flavor packings provided the foundation for the brand it was mobilized to continue to provide spectacular growth, moreover red unit sales for virtually flat 7 e 1 billion units Muldrow 100's posted a slight loss of 260 million years however because of the industry declined their combined share with us almost a tenth of a SharePoint, at the same time the mall Borough lights packings were up dramatically by the 4.6 billion units or 11.9% while market share proved a test sharepoint's 27.4 this performance makes it by far the largest daily loads our brand moreover is the largest selling brand in the industry continue to widen its Lee over its nearest competitors but as the continued strength and vitality all the components of walbro that both, so well for the future of the brand, Mulberry is the leading brand in each of the categories in which it competes full flavor hundreds and lotar beyond that Mulder is the largest selling brand among men among women and among Hispanic smokers and it sure continues to grow in each of these categories, in addition mole per share is increasing and every age group the brand is increased the share dramatically among smokers in the 18 to 24 segment to 47 percent but it's improving shareholder smokers means that the brand is keeping us consumers as they age both Trends are predictors of a continued growth of the franchise, Moltres extraordinary growth over the years is no accident has been firmly founded in Santa Barbara timing Innovative promotions and line extensions that continue to provide consumers with reasons to try them all over let's look at how each of these elements is working combination are one extension strategy has been clear expand the brand at the growing segments of the market building the pond adding to the strength of the total Wahlberg family, in 1967 it was longer late cigarettes with Marlboro 100's in 1971 it was low tar with Muldrow lights, I'm over 25% reduction in January 1985 was based on the same successful line extension strategy our advertising for 25 was consistent with the mail per image that was designed to have stopping power in keeping with our heritage of offering only the highest quality products bulbar 25 was positioned as a convenience not an economy off consumers were charged 25 percent more than five extra cigarettes, the results of them over 25% reduction follow our previous line extension experience the brand generated 3.8 billion units and sales and chief six-tenths of a SharePoint first year of its introduction, to ensure that more were 25 realized its full potential increasing retail distribution and inventory our top priorities for this year, our line extension activity on Walter I helps the brand maintain its Competitive Edge but it's the consistency of our advertising that reassures consumers that the image of the brand and the flavor promise of the franchise remain unchanged regardless of the packages we introduced, we continue to be single-minded our advertising constantly reinforcing the flavor Heritage of the brand and providing substantial support for both our full flavor and our lights packets in 1985 we ran several multiple page units for specials intended to break through the advertising clutter allowing smokers to spend a little more time in multiple countries however in today's competitive environment by in fact advertising alone, I cannot sustain over strong growth, retail promotions plan increasingly important role that tracking new smokers to Marlboro both combating the discount strategy of our bulbar continued its value added approach by offering consumers a variety of incentives free with by the to Packer carton purchase, our red with lighter continues to remain one of our most popular items, we believe that carton incentives like the ball vertex and poker card set and the mole bird or

bulbar supports gear promotion the combined impact of all this activity to give over a very competitive position early in the year, like retail promotions events promotions have grown an important small world events promotions reach out of our traditional retail environment and allow us the opportunity to distribute free samples and brand merchandise we also sponsor events that are unique and Innovative I'd like to give you a sense of how dramatically we have expanding breath quality of our promotions, the mole per cup was our first promotional event 1973 today is one of the most respected for thoroughbred horse races in America in 76 we added our Resort coverage with sampling and giveaways and few spring vacation spots it is evolved now into a year-round program conducted in over 50 markets in 1981 we participated in our first aesthetic Festival, today we conduct festivals of 15 major markets accounted for nearly 70 percent of the towing special population, 1983 the Mulberry ski challenge was operating on a test basis and Colorado Boulder today this program is available in 15 of the most prestigious ski resorts in the country, and since 1984 Mulberry country music has come to be recognized as the finest concert tour of the music industry tracking such stars as Barbara Mandrell Alabama Merle Haggard, in the early 80s we began to actively support Grand Prix auto racing events here in the US last year we significantly increased our involvement and auto racing with an extensive track Science Program along with sampling and Merchandising activities and cart Indy car racing events in addition we signed for the top drivers on the circuit board to the Mad World Championship team based on our program success last year mobile Spa, answer the Marlborough Patrick racing team featuring driver Emerson fittipaldi this year this sponsorship will make mulgarath dominant Factor US Auto Racing, well over has been and continues to be a singular marketing success significant challenges remain usually we must continue to provide consumers complete line of Park alternatives to aggressive carefully thought-out line extensions, the same time we must preserve the created image that has been so effective over the years while ensuring that the mole per brand Remains the temporary and finally his mole burrowed becomes one of every four cigarettes sold in the US must make a adequate inventory visibility and Retail to ensure that the branch that's what growth is not restricted in any way, they all turn the presentation over to Ellen Merlot group director of brand management thank you Bob and good afternoon Virginia Slims has been a consistent winner in 1985 is no exception twins was only one of three brands in the entire industry to show significant growth volume increased by almost a billion units to sixteen point seven billion and shared group to tens of a SharePoint to an all-time high of 2.8, well Full Flavor Flav's declined by 400 Days in million people like games 260 million units but as you can see weisbrot wasn't sufficient to offset the decline of the paratactic therefore the highly successful introduction of Virginia Slims 120s in October which contributed 1.2 billion units to the franchise provided the impetus to give the brand its net gain of six, 1%, Virginia Slims 120 is will launch nationally with one of the most comprehensive advertising and Retail programs ever designed to encourage trial and conversion highlights of the introductory program included 241 offers is sensitive items a special five pack offer especially designed for carton out less free pack offer and a special playing card offer, year-end Virginia Slims 124 contributing a nest of four defensive a SharePoint to the franchise, in 1985 we supported the brand with compelling and temporary advertising in 1986 and advertise it continues with graphic emphasis on the modern Virginia slim woman our ethnic Market advertising will utilize dramatic photograph and Graphics devices to emphasize our mental passing this approach will also be translated to point-of-sale Outdoor Advertising will be more impactful, in both General and ethnic markets during 1985 we once again filled at the annual Virginia Slims book of days partner says one of the most successful promotions in the industry in 1986 or promotional activity will be even more aggressive as this year's partner incentive will be the Virginia Slims slim stack while the 1987 book of days will be utilized as a 3-pack incentive, both items will be already competitive trial and conversion in addition will inaugurate the Virginia Slims slim shop for page ad which will feature specially designed clothing and Leisure Time gear on a self-liquidating bases in the area of the event promotion the Virginia Slims world championship series Remains the Brand's Premier promotion 1985 reduced record crowds at all of it, enhance our tenant sponsorship in 1986 we will be offering or retail consumers a to tax incentives you've come a long way baby shoelaces a genius with American woman's opinion poll a national survey conducted by the broker organization which investigated both women's and men's attitudes in the areas of family marriage career and child-rearing generated impressive National publicity, in 1985 the gymnosperms tested is fashion Fun Fair shopping mall promotion and three City in 86 this promotion will be expanded into tenses the show which brings the Virginia Slims imagery alive to 2 over 2 million Shoppers provides us the opportunity to sample between a half and three quarters of a million female smokers in 1986 we will continue to do product development, current projects include advertising and packaging Explorations for an ultra-light also under consideration or brown or beige wrap cigarettes as well as the lights products utilizing Innovative packages finally in 1985 Virginia slim successfully tested the Virginia Slims money coupon in 1986 we will utilize the point-of-sale execution nationally Virginia Slims money books a $2.00 Department of our new, 20 will be featured more Virginia Slims has been successful in part because of the storm immigrant groups created for the product and the many opportunities we create the smokers to relate to that unique imagery our future plans call for continuing the momentum to keep the Slim's growth Trend heading upwards, Buster notable incident edges in 1985 best hunters had just sold twenty seven point three billion units decline from 1.6 billion years it's what gross overall share of 4.6 was down two types of a SharePoint from 1984, looking at volume and detail DNH full flavor Decline 7.6% and the lights packings were off as well down 6.1% the Benson & Hedges Deluxe Ultra Lights group for 10% Benson and hedges has been a Troublesome brand declining the past three years our objectives for Benson and hedges are clear in the short term we want to stabilize the sales and share and longer term return the brand new growth, we've approached the task of improving the Brand's performance on three levels advertising and tactical consumer promotion which was TJ Klein extensions first we recognize that our old advertising to Deluxe 100 black broad-based appeal therefore we developed a new campaign to Features differences of opinion which focuses on the one thing everyone can agree on the taste of Benson & Hedges America's favorite 100, this campaign broadens the appeal in contains much of the humor and warmth reminiscent of the original Benson & Hedges advertisement, Fester catches has also been negatively affected by declining trial competitive pressure from value G therefore we have taken a number of technical steps that are consumer promotions to attract new smokers and retain current consumers we recently Mass sampled over 6 million smokers with sample 20 packs each containing a coupon good for three dollars off the purchase of a car Confessor Hedges believed that sampling and cart trial particular converting this smokers to the, to make our advertising work harder we're developing a number of themes promotions designed to generate greater consumer involvement and trial this Valentine said also includes a Cartier Diamond sweepstakes to dollar coupon offer free incentives with carton purchase like the best Innovations cookbook recipes from America's great for Resorts reward current smokers and attract new ones, let's enter Hedges primarily on the strength of his mental packings continue to be a significant brand among black smokers the brand accounts for nearly nine percent of these smokers and is important to compliment our advertising with more aggressive promotional activity last summer we implemented a major retail program and ethnic markets featuring in-store promotions signage broad based sampling and Festival activities, furthermore we're putting the finishing touches on a black music concert series which will feature prominent black acts like The Pointer Sisters Patti LaBelle, being H is also a leader among the growing spedex segment with the seven share we continue to increase both media promotional support for just important smoker group however our most important strategic challenge will be a capture a greater share of the growing hundred mm lotar segment last year we spent considerable time evaluating the Dynamics of the franchise, analyzing the prayer and share category by packing you can see the mean Age full flavor enjoys a 16 percent share of segments and the deluxe Ultra Lights packings have a 19 share of this category the likes packings are significantly under developed with only an H here therefore we are concentrating our efforts to revitalizing the liquid portion of the franchise to the Head we began chest marketing a Benson & Hedges Deluxe lights line extension this, past October line extension uses upscale packaging visit the Lux ultralight to provide news value for the brand test results to date indicates the brand as a 7/10 smokers here we are currently refined the advertising optimize the product positioning expect to be National later this year we haven't Benson & Hedges of powerful brand franchise the top quality product upscale image High consumer of recognition, Mission the challenge in 1986 will be to leverage these attributes and return to branch of growth successful implementation of our brand plans, yeah I'd like to spend a minute talking about Parliament and Saratoga these two Brands don't get a great deal of attention the nevertheless accounted for over seven and a half billion units and sales in contributed 108 million dollars in margin in Parliament despite an absence of advertising and promotion support for most of the Year generated 5.8 billion units and sales decline of 300 million gets share remain basically flat one percent, in our efforts to reverse this decline we developed a new Campaign which features the primary product benefit the recessed filter but also establishes an image of a smoker profile the campaign began running and September and receive concentrated media support Parliament top 15 markets which for counter over two-thirds Parliament sales in 1986 the brand will be further supported by an aggressive Regional retail merchandising program, Saratoga sales of 1.8 billion units in 1985 represents a decline of nearly 200 million units will share remaining basically stable at 3/10 of a share we do this performances encouraging our total was without a verdict without an advertising campaign we have just completed new created for the brand which we believe can broaden the appeal the track smokers of competing hundred millimeter 120 mm load bar brands, in addition we're currently redesigning the star total packaging to give it a more contemporary look once this is complete we will be in a position to resist supporting the plan Mary came to the market is a revolutionary product the result of a breakthrough in cigarette design manufacturing and marketing the brand established a strong franchise but lately has been in a period of decline as the low tar category hit a plateau, well total Merit volume declined by the 1.3 billion units to twenty four point two billion in total share declined to tens of a SharePoint 24.1 in 85 there was evidence that last year's launch of Merit Kings box help to stabilize the overall losses of the parent Axiom specifically the parents are packed with 1.9 million units while box contributed 1.6 billion unit, Marigold to life in the face of a declining ultra low category continue to grow the overall decline in marriage cell can largely be attributed to two factors the decline of the full price float our category and the growth of generics and value entries we don't need however that in the short term we will be able to stabilize them but putting in place long-term strategy to bring about share revitalization, action we have already developed programs to encourage trial to stimulate sales and carton outlets and to create imagery that offers a smoker benefit and provides a strong promotional platform let's first look at advertising in 1983 we launched the Steve campaign subsequent research told us the imagery generated by that advertising did not appeal to our target audience the ultralights execution of the campaign however, ferrets would be much more On Target as a result while keeping the sea is the venue we created new advertising that is motivational aspirational and provides the imagery needed to support strong promotional content utilizing and craft grass Graphics that feature men and women enjoying their sailing experience we invite the consumer to get a taste to this mirror the lotor flavor break the campaign, test extremely well among both Merit and competitive smokers the new campaign will support both parents and ultralights this new advertising will be launched in February with a dramatic three phas, in mid 85 Merit introduced a number of tactical programs to generate new smoker trial and be more responsive to competitive couponing and the valuing tree in November Mara transporter full sweep stakes in which every entrance received a free pack of Merit upon depositing a sweepstakes entry at his favorite retail outlet initial results show that this was an effective trial interesting vehicle in more will invite consumers to, it tasted it for $2 off on the next part purchase the coupon will appear in National magazines and will be retail with jeans we expect it will generate significant product movement in court now Outlet where Merit has been particularly vulnerable in the area of consumer promotion the city provided us with the backdrop in 1985 to run our successful sunglasses free with a 2-pack purchase and Uncle bags with the court, we also offered the merits Zippo lighter to Magazine on a self-liquidating basis this March Merit will offer a handsome sailcloth Wallet free with a free pack purchase we will follow up in June with a carton offer attractive see coasters and in the fourth quarter of 1986 we will feature the self-liquidating liquor ads in 1985 Merit or cologne are fireworks spectacular, find the brand of quality sampling opportunity in Seven Cities and accounted for the distribution of over a quarter of a million samples it is also produced impressive national and local publicity results in 1986 this program will be extended to include 96 while improved advertising and tactical programs to stabilize the Brand's existence position they alone not be expected to provide a meaningful turnaround in marriage, Share Credit to accomplish our goals we're looking at a number of strategies in the area of product development first we're waiting Merit hundreds box below launch this entry takes advantage of the growth in both 100 and box segments and can be expected to attract a female smokers with first-year volume potential of at least two billion units, the strategically positioning of mirrored ultralights another possibility the new brand volume, for the product concept of all the taste of leading lotar brands with only one-half to one-third guitar we believe more smokers would move to marry a Tall Tree wise for you to lay slicing updated yet traditional Merit advertising there is a solid Market opportunity for a new marital life at four milligrams of tar, high technology May well provide strong parentage for our latest orangie break through the adjustable flavor cigarettes because line extensions have recently proven more successful standing entry Merit selection is being considered as a conquered test Market alternatives, looking further ahead merits technological history is also a natural fit for a low size screen for ambient smoke cigarettes married a less or low smoke will confront the environmental or secondhand smoke concerns head-on by creating news for the franchise with a strategic new product entry and Fielding solid advertising and business building programs we are confident we can meet our goal of first stabilizing, and then once again growing this vital franchise and now to review our sales progress thank you Salado Vice President of Sales thank you Ellen thank the ongoing charge for the sales organization is to attain a retail presence which reflects our market share leadership today I want to review our progress towards that goal and discuss this year's objectives and how we intend to achieve them, we made a commitment to years ago to make Philip Morris USA America's dominant cigarette marketer at retail at the same time we recognize the need to improve our Shelf presence and depth of inventory our objective was to improve the long-standing seven percent efficiency between our share of market and our share of inventory correcting this deficiency with the basis of our 1985 strategy and that strategy at five major elements, first competitive and pre-emptive Merchandising payment programs to significantly increase carton pack space s aggressive programs to make Philip Morris USA the preeminent fixture supplier of position held by RJ are rentals for more than 30 years before continuing in store exposure of Creator promotions and point-of-sale materials that build consumer interest, for intrusive signage and displays the promote brand awareness and support new brand introductions and finally an intensive sales effort aimed at high volume accounts promoting the profitability of cigarettes and establishing Philip Morris as the ultimate cigarette merchandising Authority one of the primary tools for the implementation of these strategies is plan a are carton merchandising incentive program it's in place and 80%, my volume Outlets those selling 300 or more cartons of cigarettes a week improve our presence and the remaining 20% and to increase our share of space and existing plan a accounts on October 1st we aggressively restructured the plan a program we can now provide retailers with a clear incentive to stock enough p.m. product to meet consumer demand RJR can no longer control our destiny on their fixtures and are preemptive, payment structure has caused our smaller competitors to re-examine their needs bring space for p and g is the new plan a working we think so in the four months since October we signed 160,000 new grows three times our accomplishments for the previous 15 months the new plan has created eight hundred thousand additional cartons of display retail inventory thus since December of 1983 we have increased our shell, if Presence by over 20% however our historical disadvantage coupled with our growth objectives require that we continue to carve out additional shelf space at the current Progressive rate, the sales organization has also made significant strides in establishing p.m. as a realistic alternative to RJ r as the industry's fixture supplier we have developed a new generation of customized modular Carton and pack racks winning awards for merchandising excellent, the Salesforce has been securing carton fixture placements by concentrating on high volume chains by the end of 1985 our sales representatives in stole over 1,600 carton racks in these larger Outlets are successful re emphasis on carton merchandising during 1985 has 4 star J are in full costly response under its new plan RJ r-- s in store investment could increase more than 20 million dollars just, to maintain existing fixture planets payments replacement, increasing retail price of cigarettes has also generated new interest in single pack merchandising rapid growth and such traditional pack Outlets as convenience stores along with renewed emphasis on pack sales and supermarkets have created new opportunities for p.m. through arcade counter display program Plan B Philip Morris has gained the presence in 84,000 retail pack Outlets more than any other competitor, a new horizontal display unit we were able to secure Groove physician and high-volume chain outlets and continue the intended upgrade the larger displays, we have also gained new placements and overhead pack merchandisers which are effective for counter space is at a premium we placed over 21,000 of these racks by the end of 1985 and in so doing significantly improve the in-store impact of brand POS, long-standing RJR dominance of supermarket checkout lane racks has limited p.m. brand availability and inventory death new pack Hardware permitted us to offer centralized track merchandising in my volume Self Service Outlets 1985 over 4,000 racks were placed increasing both depth of inventory and product visibility through the paid display space atop each of the wrecks, our new merchandising programs and fixturing placements have had a noticeable impact on the availability of our brands of retail most notable is the significant Improvement in Volvo inventory levels in food stores where we have achieved a 22 percent increase over the last 12 months however our objective is to reach Winston's 14-day duration point-of-sale materials provide an essential visual bridge between product advertising and the consumer, year-end 1985 almost 750 thousand pieces of permanent materials for in place in over two-thirds of all Outlets selling cigarettes in addition we placed over 6 million temporary pieces we estimate that this concentration of point-of-sale averages 4.4 product and precious to the store, to sum up our achievements in 1985 we improved our in-store position with the series of innovative and persuasive merchandising programs and materials we made our merchandising incentive plans more attractive especially for high-volume our talents who became a major supplier and innovator of carbon fixtures, we strengthened our already substantial position in fact merchandising we increase our concentration and distribution of point-of-sale materials and we continue to carry the cigarette profitability message to retailers today we're in the third year of our plan to make Philip Morris USA the number one cigarette company at retail during 1986 we will provide even more reasons for retailers to sell cigarettes and better still Philip Morris, and continue our progress we have developed some new merchandising programs for implementation this year, support our entries into the price value Arena we will establish cigarette saving centers in high-volume carton Outlets, a newly designed Maxi overhead pack merchandiser is great with space for 25% more brand packets, a new generation of counter pack merchandiser will be placed to improve visibility and increase inventory depth by 50% and we will continue customizing POS materials for large retail chains to increase Philip Morris visibility will continue building and improving the productivity of our sales organization by adding 200 people how the sales force to make nearly 1 million additional calls a year and support our growing Hardware from it, it redeploying are expanded Workforce and targeting large-volume accounts with greater call frequency and more competitive programs, developing a national network of POS distribution centers to facilitate the flow of materials for sales organization, maximizing the use of many and Maxie bands 32 sales rep downtime at local Supply Depots and expanding the use of portable computers to help managers simplify reporting and Taylor profit presentations from customers let me conclude by restating that Philip Morris USA has made a long-term commitment assuming retail leadership in the cigarette business and that the realization of this commitment is essential to our continued growth, and we're on schedule to reach our goals and I look forward to reporting more progress soon they'll thank you video I mentioned at the outset that size and momentum can only go so far in achieving sales Sharon from the progress in the cigarette business that was true in 1985 another year of major changes in the industry a multiple Price Market became firmly established, 25 became a bona fide product category with both convenience and value option consumers readily accepted 120 mm line extension we tested or may firm plans to test new cigarette technology new packaging materials and Concepts, the nation's chain supermarkets convenience stores and mass merchandisers increased in importance as Battlegrounds for the cigarette power with RJ are being truly challenged for the first time when we went into 98 by much of this new cigarette business was unknown while we came out of 1985 stronger more flexible and more resilient than ever we need to be even better prepared for 1986, we wouldn't wait five and four of the strongest brand fresh as in the business are continuing priority is to keep these Brands healthy with Superior product quality advertising retail and consumer promotions if our past performance is any indication these Brands will be the Mainstay of most of p.m. USA sales and much of our growth in the coming years, however we also know that to ensure the long-term growth objectives we must pursue a new brand opportunity although new brands remain extremely difficult we must remember that new products OB it as line extensions delivered 7.5 billion units in 1985 our philosophy is to experiment with a wide range of product options in a real Market environment, New Brains activity is intense and aggressive concentrating in four areas specifically the value and medical segments in the upscale luxury changing area and the high-tech product differentiation Zarina, as the low price segment became more important we made an entry in this category or number one priority the price of added value category is segmented into two groups the value-added include Point users on one hand and the low price generic Darrell slopers on the other to appeal to the former group we successfully tested players like 25 and launched it nationally last month the pack selling concept is 25, let's for the price of 20 or five free cigarettes every pack the advertising is both contemporary and stylish and should attract both Richland and Century smokers are carton of selling proposition is a standard 200 cigarette carton but at a dollar 50 less than most other brands in addition we'll be offering $1 carton coupons, to reduce the retail price of a Courtney $2.50 making it competitive with generics and very appealing to coupon however we realize that to attract a hardcore generic smokers we must first offer them everyday low price of a generic then to differentiate our product we must deliver a good-tasting cigarette not currently available to them to meet this objective we have, reposition Cambridge in 1986 as an established brand name and the lowest price tear the advertising will clearly convey the good taste low price message as well as stand out from the other low price injuries Cambridge is in the initial stages of its National rolling, after the value segments are most obvious area of opportunity is the mental category menthols represent represent Twenty Eight percent of the market and Philip Morris is shear is less than 17% well we have not been successful in developing a free-standing product to the segment we did learn a great deal from last year's real test Morgan real red pack and Escapist imagery were not enough confirming that new, for Brands like others need to deliver a true unique and unique consumer benefit from this experience we plan to test mental France with real product differences this year the first gold Motorway is a foil-wrapped product which retains moisture and therefore delivers a fresher tasting cigarette mutter a gives us both a little wrapper and a research confirmed better, f it extra freshness which we call moist medical the third area of exploration is Deluxe packaging the success of definite edges to look so much alike and the high degree of Interest generated by players like that indicated that there might be room for other upskill for an introduction so we contracted with rock bands for the tub domain we then went into test with an American Blended enter the test began, an engine and is continuing to run with very restricted seals results the appeal for a u.s. luxury product in the current Marketplace a limited We are continuing to evaluate the test and are considering a more targeted approach using an international Virginia blend product and package for a real product difference this positioning may have a stronger long-term segment appeal, I'm working just from watching closely this Concord with this revolutionary adjustable filter well consumer trial level indicated significant interest in this concept repeat sales have been less than satisfactory however because of the uniqueness of the product in an industry with few real Innovations we plan to review the test results and relaunch a new test markets in 1986 with much stronger benefit oriented advertising, because Menthol smokers have shown a stronger interest in the concept and non-medical smokers we will concentrate only on the Menthol packing realizing that cigarette Innovation that stimulate incremental volume is sheer we are also pursuing other real Innovations such as low side stream nicotine free and self-extinguishing cigarette, the accomplishments and problems of 1985 set the stage for the objectives and opportunities of 1986 our agenda is a straight forward and come back at work we will continue to push moreover with Virginia Slims to new heights we accept the challenge of fixing their investment hitches through a combination of do brand tactics strategies aligning station plan to be a major factor, the price value statement with Cambridge players and others if required our president has described in 1986 is the year at retail while recognizing our tremendous accomplishments and interests last year we've remained challenge to become the number one cigarette company or read it after we pre-emptive little for competitors we intend to unseat or Jo are from the retail Supremacy they failed, first of all although the new products new technology game for cigarettes is difficult and sometimes discouraging we are resilient and determine both the mental and my technology area we have set a course for continued progress in the new cigarette industry with your health and support along with that emotion and operations are the engineering core, a human resources and Finnegan I'm certain it will have no trouble going create new field in fact living through the adversity of today's computer failure as an improvement to very important things one that we are very determined and resilient working group and to that you were very supportive board of directors thank you very much for taking questions very good, it's even better, we can make it right about between between a quarter and a third of basically Vinnie and the every revision of the place, I have to accommodate more spin we're doing everything that we possibly can to what those things and it does have a benefit to imagine you noticed to respond to our last fixture program Reynolds head to defend their position is to defend their position plus the 40 million dollars, the advantage of the audience's death 40 million dollars comes out of their coupon budget and that's exactly what we want them to have to do we want to try, which brand therefore which advertising is directed toward the blue-collar smoker, Mauro is very Universal but Marlboro gets virtually the entire working class population other than other than the black population Benson & Hedges is are predominantly black Grant but Marlboro really covers every other side of it is true most of our friends are upscale but that is helped us through this generic thrust because most of, that demographics is through college so the case it is fair to say that really is a philosophy in the policy but that case you only could basically machine you to go after blue-collar by going after Duke up you go we do everything elegant with an elegant purveyors of mass merchandisers and that's the way we think you attract everyone don't attract bukata people by portraying Blue Collar people per se, so we don't really go after blue color but I'm making it do if I have intruded well if you were forced into something as a result of not having the opportunity to television and I think it has made me much more aware of the marketplace being people personally I think the approach to your marketing given your budget and Faith television opened, yup would you Retreat away from this creative Innovative personal approach to 40 half minutes what our marketing mix of evolved the way it has I think you're very lucky, or marketing mix towards things like event promotions consumer promotions those things in any case for instance in the in the beer business where they still have television they're more in mixes have evolved in that way so I think others would too I think that there's a an extension of your image that you can do through a vet promotion I even put the product in people's hands that that the mass media just can't do and I think that everybody's discovering that and, and as you say we discovered it by force of the of the television band but now that we have it I don't think we would give up mr. chairman will turn it back to you and we'll answer cases of lunch or what okay thank you very much Frank and Bill thanks a lot of very good presentation anybody wants to take a lunch break I wanted

gywv0183,"the following video tape is the second in a series of employee Communications programs we will hear from Jeff Bible Marie bring general counsel and Executive Vice President for external Affairs Steve Parrish senior vice president corporate Affairs and a group of employees representing all of our companies who participated in a question and answer session about important issues facing Philip Morris and the tobacco industry and now here's Jeff Bible, I'm glad you're taking the time to join me today but I wish I could be having this conversation in person with every one of our more than 150,000 employees in 180 countries around the world over the next several months I expect a visit with as many of you as possible to discuss some of the issues of importance to you and our company, I'm taking the opportunity to speak with you now because over the last few months the US tobacco industry and our company have been the focus of an unprecedented series of attacks some radical steps have been taken by a US government agency and endorsed by President Clinton that had the potential to lead to Serious harm to our entire industry if left unchallenged, Food and Drug Administration commissioner David Kessler some members of the US Congress and many anti smoker activists have used a variety of tactics to support their efforts to attempt to regulate the ability of adult Americans to choose to smoke and the ability of our company to Market and sell our cigarette products in a free and competitive Marketplace, we shall not let their efforts go unchallenged, in pursuit of their goal they have manipulated and distort facts to accuse Philip Morris of a broad array of improper conduct and to intact the Integrity of our company and its outstanding employees and we shall not let these accusations and attacks stand on challenged not with the American public and not with the people of all of the markets where we conduct business and most of all not with our employees, so first let's set the record straight on the issue of Youth smoking Philip Morris believes children should not smoke and should not have access to cigarettes smoking and purchasing cigarettes a decisions for adults to make Philip Morris is committed to that philosophy around the world and we've taken actions to back up our commitment he fact we recently proposed an aggressive program in the u.s. directed at preventing youth access to cigarettes, we stand ready to work with anyone who truly wants to address this issue and we are working within the cultures and laws of the other countries where we do business to take appropriate actions to keep cigarettes away from kids, but do not be misled by what has been proposed by the president and the FDA rather than choosing to join us to make our program work and to explore other areas where we could work together to address this issue David Kessler an unelected Federal bureaucrat has decided to seek control over our industry and control over choices adults should be allowed to make in a free Society, you've heard me say it before if you're right and you fight you will win as you know we have a very recent example to back up that philosophy ABC accused us of spiking us cigarettes with extra nicotine we told them they were wrong and they settled anyway so we sued them and ABC apologized now let's look at the result PC this is World News Tonight the ten billion, lawsuit filed against ABC News by Philip Morrison r.j. Reynolds was settled this evening with a statement ABC News agrees that we should not have reported that Philip Morris and Reynolds add significant amounts of nicotine from outside sources that was a mistake that was not delivered on the part of ABC but for which we accept responsibility and which requires correction we apologize to our audience Philip Morris and Reynolds Just does with ABC's admitted mistake we can't let stand David Kessler's grab for power, over the u.s. tobacco industry and 45 million adult Americans smokers that is why as a first step we've joined with other us tobacco manufacturers in a suit to prevent Kessler from accomplishing what he set out to do let me say unequivocally our lawsuit has absolutely nothing to do with you sneaking it has everything to do with an unbridled and illegal government action it has everything to do with stopping not only the DraStic and illegal actions now, on the table but the inevitable result of giving an unelected bureaucrat the power to do more this is going to be a long and tough fight but keep in mind we are right this is a country that still believes in Freedom and that is what this B about while I'm confident that we shall Prevail in the end what concerns me as much or more is the highly orchestrated stream of statements speeches and news reports you've, been hearing that falsely accused Philip Morris of a broad array of improper conduct, what the people who make the accusation to done and continue to do is to manipulate and misrepresent the facts to their own ends these tactics are despicable I know these reports concern you as well I know you're hearing from friends and neighbors and family who've been hearing the same reports we want you to have the facts we're proud of our company and you have every reason to be proud as well, Mary bring our distinguished general counsel and Executive Vice President for external Affairs and equally distinguished Steve Parrish who is senior vice president corporate Affairs are going to provide you more information to put these tactics into their proper perspective let's join them as they discuss this with the group of Philip Morris employees from all segments of our company and remember we are right and we will fight and we intend to win for you and for our company, now we have with us today employees from Philip Morris USA Kraft Foods Miller Brewing Company Philip Morris Capital Corporation Philip Morris International Kraft Foods International and Philip Morris Management corporation, I want to thank all of you for coming here to participate in this meeting today and Steve and I will do our best to answer any questions you might have about these and other issues of concern so let me ask now who has the first question my name is Marion Walgren I work with Philip Morris Management Corp in corporate contributions I had a question about the ABC case after reading the apology that appeared in the Wall Street Journal it appears that the apology was very carefully worded, and I had a question as to whether or not Philip Morris companies was satisfied with the apology we're in let me try that one the answer is absolutely yes we are very satisfied with the apology it is a total and complete Victory as far as we are concerned what you have seen in the last few days is a bit of revisionist History where ABC themselves are characterizing the program as not really focusing on spiking, is focusing on something else manipulation in the Recon process a number of the members of the press of picked up on that theme the plaintiffs lawyers and mr. Waxman and others have also picked up on that theme and said well this was really not a significant apology because it didn't it didn't go to the heart of the program as I say that is revisionist history if one looks at the program that they one program and of the public reaction after it starting with President Clinton and going all the, all the way through the Waxman and Senator Kennedy and surgeongeneral Coop they were all focused on the outrageous charge that we were adding more nicotine to cigarettes in order to keep people smoking the spiking allegation was the central core of that program that's why we brought the lawsuit and that's why we decided to settle it when ABC said we were wrong and we apologize so we think that that apology was quite significant and we think that we got exactly what we, wanted to get when we brought the lawsuit was to vindicate ourselves in the Public's eye and make everyone realize that the outrageous allegation that we were spiking cigarettes was absolutely untrue that it was a lie and they have now apologized for that and I think we should all feel very good about that I can tell you I certainly do my name is Glory makoni I work at Philip Morris International and Rye Brook and my concern is now that the media has backed down, from accusing us of spiking cigarettes we still have the issue of manipulation to deal with doesn't that leave us vulnerable to get back into the spiking issue and how do we protect ourselves from that and how do we put that completely to rest well I think that's a very good question because there's no question there's no doubt that you still read a lot about the so-called manipulation and I think it's important to realize that just, just as we do not Spike nor do we manipulate we simply don't do it I think we put the spiking issue to rest once and for all and hopefully we'll be able in the near future to put the manipulation issue to rest as well the fact of the matter is that every cigarette that we manufacture has to comply with the published tar and nicotine nicotine delivery numbers that are required by the Federal Trade Commission, so we manufacture our cigarettes and through a process of blending and filtration we ensure that we are delivering to the smoker exactly the level of tar and nicotine that we indicate we're going to deliver now that's not manipulation that simply quality control manipulation is a word that has a sort of pejorative connotation in suggest that we're doing something wrong and that's the reason that the anti-smoking activists use the word but there is, not a single thing in any of our documents or in any of the evidence that has been disclosed by dr. Kessler or mr. Waxman which indicates that we are manipulating nicotine in order to keep people smoking which is the allegation that many of them make the fact of the matter is if you look back over the history of our products during the past several years there has been a continual decline in the amount of nicotine that is delivered to smokers and as a matter of fact if you look at the, focus of the reconstituted process which was the subject of some of the ABC program and other critics the reconstituted process takes nicotine out of the tobacco leaf and every step of the process and at the end of that process there's less nicotine in the sheet that is used for use in manufacturing circuit cigarettes than there was in the original plant before it went into that process, s so the simply isn't any truth to it and I think that in due course when we have the opportunity in courtrooms or in other forums like the Food and Drug Administration to get our side of the story across it will become clear that there simply isn't anything to the manipulation charge just as there was not to the spike in charge my name is Paul Farkas I work at the Stockton Street facility in Richmond I'm a chief shops do it for the International Association of machinists and Aerospace workers, the reason story in the Richmond newspapers concerning the study conducted in Chesterfield County with the third grade students has caused a morale problem in the factory due to the fact of the adverse public opinion that towards full of Mars employees you care to comment further on that issue sure let me just try to put that proposed study into perspective first remember that it was never proposed that we were going to give cigarettes to kids, it was never proposed that we were going to do research on nicotine and children what we were doing or what we were talking about doing was something that people who are funded by the federal government we're doing namely looking at personality profiles of people who were smokers and comparing them to personality profiles of people who turned out not to be smokers The Proposal which was not carried out was to try to identify whether these specific children turned out to be smokers when they were adults so too, her eyes this as nicotine research on kids or research on smoking and kids is absolutely untrue and outrageous I'm Rose Wang from Kraft Foods International regarding the electroshock study what is the relevance of that subject to waxman's agenda or Kessler's agenda number one and the second question is how is that study any more or less extraordinary than any you know other study that's being done in Laboratories and, cities worldwide lets you make two very good points that study was done in complete accordance with scientific protocols that others outside of Philip Morris had been doing before we did this study it's also important to remember that this very mild electric shock that we were talking about was administered to the fingers I think some people tried to give the impression that it was something much more Insidious than that it was done according to a strict scientific protocol, that had been done by independent scientists outside of Philip Morris and that was all reported in the scientific literature it was part of a discussion that was going on both inside our industry and outside the industry which is why do people smoke what effects if any does smoking have on stress and other things and scientists inside the industry and outside the industry were interested in those things and so they used scientifically accepted protocols to, try to address the issue you know Steve I'd like to just add one thing to his kind of anecdotal but as to that issue but I think it's kind of interesting mr. Waxman made it sound as though this was some sort of aberrational way out experiment that Philip Morris was conducting that everyone should be shocked about I remember when I was in college the psychology department was always posting ads on the bulletin board saying for $5 any student can volunteer to be a participant in this, are meant and they the experiments went on for pages I mean how long could you stand on one foot for example I remember was one of them and students were flocking to volunteer for these programmes of the way of that have making a few extra bucks so this is commonplace at universities psychology departments are always recruiting students to participate in these experiments and it's something that goes on and I think has gone on for a long long time and for mr. Waxman to suggest that somehow this was unique",0.8393571057142856,0.6780095,0.9128389,gywv0183,,tobacco; cigarette;  <a href='http://www.archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&mediatype=movies&collection=industry-archives'>Browse by keywords in UCSF industry videos</a>,EMPLOYEE VIDEO ON FDA CHARGES AGAINST PHILIP MORRIS,
gzgb0039,"I think they're on the right track I just think they need to work on just a little bit more like they're about halfway through yeah okay they've covered every every aspect as far as a secondhand person goes but the flavor is the main issue for a smoker's a lot of smokers you if they get stressed out they smoke a cigarette and probably these aren't going to give him the same satisfaction because a, feminine as a regular cigarette he hung the positive feedback that you get you said it was it from your son who's 17 you don't get that with your regular cigarettes so I'm going to play a little game has gone exactly they go they go like that and I'm sure at some point maybe wears on you or maybe it goes in one ear and out the other now I don't know but going to how much you keep silent about it okay but in this case he's not doing that kind of liked it, and you have an option of smoking this product in your house and he doesn't give you grief or saying forget it I'm going to I'm not I can't deal with the taste of this product I'm going to stay with this and deal with the grief you very you've decided I'll smoke this and deal with the grief instead okay that's fair that's fair enough it's just not their 30-year the balance of the trade-offs hasn't hasn't gotten to that point for you okay with this be a dismal failure if they were to introduce this product now I think so I think so okay, so we would be really bad okay I think right at the point they're at right now it's an excellent Aid in stopping, why no nicotine and you have something in your hand and if you want to stop smoking bad enough you'll put up with a flavor mmm you know and I felt that I came pretty close to not needing the nicotine okay okay with that maybe with with the aid of I don't know nicotine gum or a nicotine patch somebody could quit smoking pretty quick because that's one of the way I've tried patches and the main thing in, trying to stop was I had to have something in my hand the nicotine was there I just had to have something in my hand, question that I'm going to wrap it up and with give you an opportunity to ask me some questions if you want a lot has been in the Press recently about secondhand smoke right actually for the last year or two there so you're aware of what they're saying about secondhand smoke right okay that it's a what an annoyance or a hazard for both both both do you believe that, yeah you can call your toolbar and Noise Okay as far as a hazard goes I don't believe anything the government says okay and from what I've seen this is a government survey it's totally been done by the government mmm and I don't I don't believe it okay okay I don't believe the surveys okay one types of cancers that people are getting from cigarettes because I honestly believed if they looked a little closer they might find it there's a lot of cancers out, out there that people get rid of this smoke or not you know and I don't think that secondhand smoke is going to affect someone bad enough for Endless there unless they don't mind it enough to sit in a room with 20 people smoking cigarette every kind of life okay well now the hand you know you can walk into a room where there's you just walk in and I've been there smoking automatically your eyes started burning your nostril started burning and my throat so, you know it very well could if you were around it every day you could have tried to tell you he they're not in you're not inhaling a freshly lit cigarette in inhaling all the smoke from that and then exhaling I was there getting his he exhaled by product for her most of the Tarzan it I've already gone down into your lungs you know and there's a lot of it's had a lot of it has and it comes back out and they contain gets on the windows and things like that but do you enjoy smoking, and if somebody asked you to do you enjoy smoking hella how would you answer that question yeah yeah enjoy Tim I think that's why I have such a hard time quitting because I do I do enjoy save you really want to quit you will you will and I know that my uncle quit stuck dropping trash can and talk smoking a cigarette again I've tried the Nicorette and I'll try to quite a few different methods second on Lollipops and yeah obviously we do like it, it's okay psychological habit honest okay ask me some questions if you want is a real cigarette yeah yeah it is I you know depends on how you define a cigarette obviously but it has real tobacco and yeah I cut it open we saw that yeah they did that in the in the demonstration yeah it is it is a real cigarette it's obviously not for everybody some people really like it some people really don't like it some people like yourselves are saying well I do, like to like it but I don't know some kind of someplace in the middle but it is the cigarette and it serves a purpose for some people there's some people that are really like the idea and like the way it tastes there's other people that don't not everything is for all people so but it is it is a real cigarette if you define a cigarette is something that smokes any other questions or, how do they intend on doing more research into yeses flavor yeah yeah it's all I've got I really believed it's a beneficial product and all aspects to remember the name of it incidentally Eclipse okay I was trying to you after they brought a pack or a little boxer and ahead packs yeah I can remember I've been trying okay okay and you remember in you remember her name okay did you remember what the packaging look like and stuff would eutectic prank that are attractive you liked it, so you how about the videotape did you like that or was that take it or leave it, the video today is pretty informative but I believe they could pretty much covered and they could have done it without showing right baby okay thank at the cigarette into then they on the video they showed the inside of the cigarette yeah the diagram the inside some people almost have to have that visual aid though it's just I have to picture it in your head well somebody's talking about I'm sure they do plan on doing doing more research on it so, so maybe if you're agreeable at some point they might give you a call back and say hey we've got another another idea here are you interested in taking a shot yeah I'm interested in changing the flavor and probably if they change the flavor I would change over to okay you spoke the brown tip product and you smoke the brown pelican rifle flavor yeah okay very good because to me it seemed a smoke whites hmm it just seemed like a lot cigarette I agree when I was came in a roofing, they they had the regulars and lots of em try and one it almost seemed like the lights were heavier than the lights may be heavier than the amazing like smoke and Virginia's Lambda sounds like paper so it's funny it's different people that's how come I said no let's try the full flight work so that's what I'm going with okay you had mentioned to Helen and then we're out of here that you because you just purchase the carton of my clear you were really going to give this a shot put those aside, did you Tim start off going strictly with this product right you move back and forth I'm out of smoking one or two cigarettes a day and the other of the other ones so you went about four days or so smoking nothing but this and with that really did you do that because it was part of the researchers that the way you would have handled it in the real world if you went out and bought this product, well at this point if it was on the market I would buy it just as just to cut back on the nicotine intake that I do have I might buy a pack and a couple packs of Marlboros just try to cut back you say cut back in the nicotine do you mean the nicotine or the Tower of both in other words you're saying cut back on in the kingdom and to me that's our seems to be the most threatening okay issue the nicotine is addictive fine but from it's all right but the things that they're saying kill you, remember the talk so that is the most important thing okay do you remember what the tar was in the cigarette Point 1 mg okay point one so very low I guess and even though it's that low, and you're smoking a 16 mg product right now the trade-off is still too big for you to realize or to to accept that trade-off in switching down right well the flavors okay I mean that's that's the only issue right now okay as far as changing I like to taste of Marlboros and Winston's everything mentions will strong but I like the Marlboro a lot it's like you come close to that flavor then okay good definitely change good any other questions, we're done early but I sense that you're not going to have a problem with that so can I use the phone I guess there's lots of ladies out there and I think it's very like crazy I think that they'll probably say they'll be fine well I would definitely be interested in coming crying okay, okay I'm sure I'll still be spoken oh yeah alright very good well thank you both",0.8244614770833335,0.6701502,0.9128384,gzgb0039,,tobacco; cigarette;<a

gzhh0257,"with DVD number 4 at, 4:53 so before you get started I'll just note for the record that we've been on the record now for about seven hours I think that's actually a reasonable amount of time for us to have been president make this witness available will continue for a little bit longer but is that position is, is gone on longer in YouTube, our response to that is it's depositions being taken in complete compliance with the Tennessee Federal rules procedure, I haven't heard any argument to the contrary, I'm just putting you on notice, I just handed the witness exhibit 15, Park Min Joo, Malcolm sorry this is a 2015 date-stamped Mak underscore T NS ta 08512 918,you recognize this is an email to number of individuals including yourself dated July 23rd 2012 correct that is correct subject is exha go is the focus correct key assert orange listed as high correct yes they reasoned out you receive this document, okay, it's easier to just go ahead and read through the document correctly boys, T not sure I am supposed to share this with you or not but this is the message I received from Bill last week for indices do not forward I don't care one bit about call metrics between now and the launch meeting the best thing that we can do to finish strong and launch 32 strong is to live with high potential exha go targets over the next four weeks, I'm giving you interrupts the autonomy to do whatever it takes bypass low targets drive three hours to a better one whatever just drive as much exhausted or business as humanly possible before August the 12th, we talked about being the CEO of the territory or District I don't think we really buy that normally it's a very risky for the organization but over the next four weeks write it as your business I'll have your back on the call metrics frequency with the right message on people who can make a difference should carry us all three of those elements need to be there sell like your livelihood depended on it Bill live with axalta riders will, so I call Tuesday thanks cobby, I was reading that email or Fresher a glitch at all about having received this email or discussed it with eight individuals on this email, do you understand oh first of all who's you know Bill is I'm sure he's referencing into Bill Nichols Superior, he made a bill Nichols was Todd Dean Superior Corrections Todd day at this time being your district manager correct sir okay, what do you understand Bill meant when he said I'm giving you and Reps the autonomy to do whatever it takes, I don't know specifically what he means that, did you ever find out what he meant on the, on a subsequent conversation with either Todd or Bill, I don't recall any conversation okay so so as far as you know you never got any more guidance from Mallinckrodt as to what, was meant in this email to do whatever it takes, I don't recall, don't recall, the point being made here if I'm reading it correctly if you agree is that there's an impending launch of a 32 mg form of exalt go that's what builds allude to here correct that would be my understanding okay and that there's a push to sell as much as all go 60 mg as humanly possible before the release of the 32 milligrams strength objection, that's the words that are listed and is that how you understood this email objection, is the strategy that's implicated here that the more prescribers who are prescribing the 60 mg eggs all go that will make it easier to convert them to available 32 mg strength when it's launched that your understanding of the strategy here, objection lack of foundation this characterizes Park Festival, no I don't necessarily agree with that but do you understand what the push to sell much of zalga was humanly possible was driven by your action is not so super cool but makes the comment talk about being the CEO of the territory or District I don't think we really buy that normally and then here's the quote it's very risky for the organization, but you understand that to me, I understand that to me this is a statement that's been used in my entire career in this industry being the CEO of your territory that you act independently of managing your territory because you know the landscape of the territory people that are making call this or frequency reports don't know the landscape with their territory so to act as the CEO wouldn't be necessarily to abide by the call metrics but to, make sure that you are focusing on the right people during that timeframe right people meeting in this particular case for the launch of these all go 32 would be not initially spend our time with prescribers that were looking at 10:00 CET or another product but to pursue you have to be targeting our physicians that were exalted o potential okay and what's risky what's the risk posed the organization over a sales rep acting as a CEO of their Market to action I'm not, specifically sure what he means by that, do you ever find out what was meant by it being very risky for the organization, what did you understand was met by cell like your livelihood depended on it, Brett that if, these example sales are made that people might lose their jobs, action I don't believe it was, do you recall any discussion about any of the things discussed in this email with individuals on this list after the seeing all the set directions,had you a document 16 which is based and mnk underscore sta 08 93 55-47 beginning it let me know,and this is an email from Dan pull chefs key to yourself copy and Bill Nichols from April 15th 2013 correct subject is field is it for 10 through 11 correct he have any reason to doubt you receive this email in the normal course of business on about the state and this email generally describes that Dan polish FC who at the time was the district sales manager for sale, Carolina so he was your DM at this time he went with you spent your days in the field with you serving or your sales calls correct correct okay and Mel first paragraph expound comment you have some excellent relationships with your positions and their staff and it was great seeing you leverage those relationships to gain commitments to our X example go this is our X it means prescribed correct screwing, he says for example with beer and Healthcare went right after the oxy patient and ask for them to prescribe exha go since those patients could no longer get oxy we that correctly that's what it's late now it does reading that refresh her recollection about that incident at certain Health Care okay action, somewhat okay what's the truth what's it remind you of this actually had to have new decisions made for them as to the best pasta the cost of treatment so in that particular can make different case would beard and health care for a patient who are any provider for that man, for that patient before now had to make the new pathway of care for the patient and I was wanting to key positions all go as an opportunity for those patients that could no longer get what they were previously prescribed okay so this situation that that mr. Paul chefs Keys referring to it's a little different from what we talked about earlier today with respect to break through pain correct nobody okay this we're talking about, substituting exha go for an oxycontin prescription as opposed to just supplementing an oxycontin regimen with exha go for breakthrough pain correct objection you wouldn't use Oxycontin these all go together that's what I took from your question so how is this different from what we described earlier you described earlier about the Breakthrough pain, sure, in this particular case, the patients were able to give their current regimen, so there were a couple of options that patients were going to have to be chosen for Iams all there was one of those options and the conversation would have been very similar in regards to what the patient's benefits were regarding is all good but positioning it for a provider who writes Oxycontin it's no longer available at that point is to give them that opportunity to make that decision versus other opportunities that were in the field, okay and what were some of those opportunities do you recall this time I believe of Hannah was an opportunity for him, I can't recall so in this context then it's all go was positioned against Opana, is that Chris accurate indirectly but yes it's not stated understood all right can you read that that last full paragraph there starting with you have yes so now it's important to stay focused with your Rowdy targeting in messaging routing needs to be focused around our topdesk office issues targeting them with the right product and right message, those who have been moving up the rank report have been driving both exhaust go and Somerville business while minimizing any losses with confetti this is also plenty of time to get in the money for the do axis contest president's Club is definitely within your reach keep driving the business and believe it thank you again and I'm looking forward to seeing you at our meeting and may get selling your make president's Club at found crud no sir, very close I don't recall financially what was the benefit of making presents Club here's all their financial benefit to making President's Club, was there any benefit to making presidents Club, may seem to be dangled out there like a carrot on a stick I just curious it you shall I do,did you remark is zip 17, I gave away my copy, a zero eight eight eight three six five four, one review and let me know when you're ready,today from you to Todd Dean on April 23rd 2012 correct subject is the story gets better correct yes all right, this reference is a lunch you had with a dr. fox and Rachel pain correct that's correct okay well these were individuals on your target list this time yes sir okay and you work out that Rachel I'm sorry deductible practices dr. Fox part of it he only owned okay and was he one of your higher prescribers for your opioid products amount cried, he was in the top five top ten recount that Rachel called you to tell you she was writing her first exalted go correct that's what it says yeah and she needs to know where to send the patient, and then you told her where and then drop by that Pharmacy to let them know, act that accurate that's what it states is okay and what was the why was racial confused as to where this impatient can actually looking at the Timeline here this would have been shortly after I started with them, not many pharmacies had stalked exhaustive so you didn't want to patient is showing up at a pharmacy that didn't have the product and that's typical in the opioid space because they offered limited shelf space within the pharmacies if I knew of a particular Pharmacy that had it at this particular time as we're launching out or I am in this territory then I would have advised the prescribers to where it was located okay so is it fair to say that part of your job duties at Mound crop and sales role, all was to understand where your mail across brand opioid product was being stalked in your territory injection sure okay so that when a prescriptions written for example go there's no problem getting the prescription filled, least less problem sure Fair, and do you remember the name of the pharmacy you're going to hear no sir, okay you go on to say is an independent in the owner is there and he's really appreciative and then tells me how gets a lot of scripts from this group in Lenoir City and I need to call on them I read that correctly I believe so do you recall that conversation with the pharmacist, how do you know what group in Lenoir City that he was saying you got a lot of scripts from based on this email, not specifically it was what our city at this time part of your market so we so okay, and is this something typical that the pharmacist would let you know hey there's this practice out there they're running a lot of scripts that I'm filling you should know about that Junction that's typical with okay but wasn't a typical amount Croc wreck it wasn't a typical for opioids okay okay so this pharmacist tells you about this group in Lenoir City are running a lot of scripts and then, spawn I explained that I have tried and been met by security and so forth, every that correctly its we have States okay fact they were security there that refresh your recollection about what group were talking about in north city possibly yes and what do you believe that group was, this particular one would dwell in his name of Tanya Warwick at the bottom that was the prescriber, tiny Warwick's is the prescriber at that location and on our city okay, anything else about the location, so when you tell a pharmacist of the the pharmacy that you already tried to go but security turns you away that he said we'll just tell them that I sent you and they'll let you in so that in essence we told you that's what I've listed here yes okay so in fact he refers to is getting the red carpet treatment correct as well placed you yes okay and then, doubt that when you went back you got 26 minutes with them talking about about the product and you felt very strongly that we will see Tanya Warwick's name is a new prescriber real soon, correct you know tiny War has had other prescribers in her office and the time, she added to your target list your knowledge,oh I'm sorry, back on exhibit 16 I'm sorry 17 what was Todd Dean's response to your email, awesome, all right you've handed you what's been identified exhibit 18 or not the handed dude this is document-based mnk underscore T NS ta 0 8 9 3 3 6 5 4, number viewing please let me know,okay document to a number of individuals including yourself on June 4th 2013 correct that's correct mr. Paul chefs Key Well any reason to think you didn't receive that email on about that date, he asks, this is subject ABS algo app correct the express disseminated says they want our feedback on the new example go how you been using it value has added with your Excel go print stations Etc there's a feedback on the app is that fair okay so above you respond to mr. Poole chefs Keys email correct yes you do you respond to June 5th 2013 correct yes sir okay, just read the paragraphs starting after Dan, I have really had good conversations around the pill call out shark for the oxy patient and of course around the technology page and Polly Ox layers trip across some good conversations anytime I had mentioned that the technology offers barriers to those looking to divert the technology and try to place it into a liquid that it creates a gooey thick cardiotoxic product the immediate response in every situation is a shock one that o we must we will just kill the patient's then, for that we'll send the herds one when then drawing the comparison that oxy also contains this substance and was what recently gain favor with the FDA in their new labeling it has been mixed in and it's reviews of the provider than drawing a comparison to oxy an exhaust go which is not favorable for many standpoints here in Knoxville so I have to them back pedal and re-discuss the efficacy of a jogo and wants a one-a-day dosing, okay, let's take that paragraph little bit of time, what you refer to in the first sentence about the pill pull out sharp for the oxy patient that wasn't something included in the example Go app, is that your recollection, I don't recall specific to it but it must have been okay and that would have been a chart talking about how exotic 0 can be used to use with respect to a patient's already on an oxycontin regiment is that their Junction form Junction Foundation again I don't recall the direct correlation there okay the sentence starting any time I've mentioned that the technology offers barriers to those looking to, divert the technology, and try to place it into liquid that it creates a gooey thick cardiotoxic product, I read that correctly correct all right impact that technology offers barriers to those looking to divert the technology what you mean by that, was the barrier to those looking to divert the technology the fact that if it was if the product the exalt go was put into the liquid, tried to solve it, it turns into a gooey toxic product, injection I don't recall the specifics of that particular technology do you understand how exalted go potentially could be abused by trying to dissolve the product and either, inhale or not hail or somehow inject the product after dissolving it Junction form Foundation, no I don't recall that I do understand the other opioids products that that's one method of abuse that if the product was able to be dissolved in liquid that the active ingredient could be drawn out with syringe and injected connection form Foundation no I don't recall that okay so do you know what you were talking about when you wrote, about the technology offering a barrier to those looking to divert Direction asked and answered who's out there I don't recall specifics, okay, what about the placing into liquid that it creates a gooey thick cardiotoxic product if you mean that bad, he just says what it says there I don't recall specifically what that meant Oh the barrier to Diversion was that to prevent abuse of the drug, injection lack of foundation I don't recall that, get exotic do have of use deterrent properties not as much did not not to my knowledge okay, is are you not discussing and abuse deterrent technology in this email checks your microphone dacian asked and answered I don't recall that situation here are using firm tamper-resistant in relation to exalt go not that I recall, is the is this, technology, that enables the product to create a gooey thick cardio toxic product when placing liquid is that a tamper-resistant technology, is this technology to create a thick cardiotoxic product when placed inside the liquid is that a resistive technology Junction Foundation, not to my knowledge, did you receive a trading about, what you're describing here about is all go creating a GUI thick cardiotoxic product when placing liquid Junction I don't recall specifics, okay and then you make the comment the immediate response in every situation you talk about this toxic, product is 0 we will just kill the patient's then what you mean by that, that was a quote from whoever made that comment I don't know what they would mean by that you have no idea what they meant when they said this would well we will just kill the patient's then after hearing about the thick cardiotoxic product check she has to answer for that will thin the herds want it which mean by that, probably typo there did you mean to say or that will thin the herds that want it, actually I don't recall I don't know if you don't recall anything about why you wrote what you wrote here, the last thing that sends you right, drawing a comparison to oxy and O's all go which is not favorable for many standpoints here in Knoxville you see that we do see there okay and what did you mean by that, I specifically don't, recall what that reference, if it is all go and exhausting Oxycontin for in the providers mind equal when what they provided that could draw a comparison Asylum assume that relationship, well you call it not favorable for many standpoints correct that's what it states he says here in Knoxville, in particular yes that's okay my territory and without comparison not be favorable as far as exalt ago concerned because of the stigma associated with Oxycontin being a abuse abuse drug objection I don't recall exactly why that would have been stated well in your experience two years selling opioid products in Knoxville was there a stigma attached Oxycontin that you are aware of ejection, I believe it was we've got heard there was okay and what was the stigma you heard about tell tell us all what stigma associated with Oxycontin well know that it was specifically with oxy I think it was just with opioids and you know a stigma that, potential, abuse diversion and was that particularly heightened awareness of that Knoxville, I don't return, generally speaking you did you try to avoid comparing exha go in an oxycontin against one another one discussing the product with prescribers injection, I don't recall making comparisons discussing resolver for the appropriate patient and what is on those properties to demonstrate for them, do you recall, the source of these conversations that you refer to in this email so you recall where these quotes came from in this email which providers providers goes to you, what a likelihood comes from somewhere on your target list objection, I don't know, has your document identify as exhibit 19 it's Mak underscore T NS t a zero eight eight eight three six five two, we do get a chance to review,you're going to stocking it to emails the first page is sent from you too Todd Dean and Bo Hamilton on May 12 2012 correct that is correct subject is Advanced Pain Therapeutics of Knoxville correct and reason that you sent this email on this date, all right and you're referring to a meeting that you had with some prescribers correct see you soon and during that meeting, about two-thirds down a paragraph here's a quote start he throws out, you start reading that paragraph on that sentence starting with he throws out he throws out my drug is killing people I'm sorry let me start over I think he missed it forward my starting over he throws out how my drug is killing people, and confuses it with power down on several occasions but we went through the data discuss the conversions answered his questions and at the end he gets up and tells me that I have been very honest individual with him and he appreciate that that and then walks towards me and gave me a hug the bit unnerved but nonetheless of on a bound was made in that first call okay that's good, a comment he throws out how my drug is killing people you're afraid to exalt over there, I believe so, did you get any more information from the doctor as to why he told you his drawer drug was killing people, can you believe it the doctor was simply confused when he said your product was killing people he was really referred to another product that's your understanding that would be my understanding this doctor is dr. Gollum Gollum Reza sure Eevee okay, and was this Clinic that you were visiting was it the advanced pain therapy works of Knoxville according to the subject yes okay and you know dr. Rosenberg has referred to in this paragraph you're calling dr. Rosenberg any other time during your tenure at Mallinckrodt not to my knowledge okay that was right here dr. Rosenberg was arrested three months after this email was sent,Angie document labeled the vic-20 your deposition Bait Stand mnk underscore T NS ta 08 933 804, overdoing it let me know please, oh wait I read the wrong thing in the record I apologize, I'm sorry I meant to say exhibit 20 is coming K underscore T NS ta 089 3409 to, you know when you're finished, on this date of July 25th 2013 over the past few weeks but he's coming to a problematic standpoint now, over the past few weeks I have had providers mention that they are having a few issues getting exalted o at the pharmacy parentheses something not new or uncommon and we just mean digging into the pharmacies a bit deeper, but then comment started being made that patients were having trouble getting their meds of any kind and if some of my key offices had actually broken contract to allow patients the ability to find their man's anywhere they could in digging more into the pharmacies the past week and a half I have found out that all pharmacies in my area are having problems getting their opioids and from the wholesalers I had been told that the DEA has been involved through limiting quantities that is being shifted to the Knoxville area we were such, hi the use this is not only going to have a significant impact on my business but the overall Market as well I have both a CVS and a grocery store chain try and see if I came in with an example script could they order it for me both said they could not that it would exceed their percentage of scheduled to use to all scripts order by the pharmacy this week I really am at a loss on what I can actually do and other factors are now putting the screws on the area due to the high abuse we have here, this is more than protective protecting the script and getting a pharmacy to order an exorbitant, you recall who told you, that the DEA has been involved in limiting quantities as being shipped into the Knoxville area due to such high abuse, no not specifically did you hear that for more than one person, objection I don't recall it was that ever common knowledge to your to understanding objection to me do you remember having a general understanding when worked in Mallinckrodt that shipments of opioids being restricted by the DEA coming in to Knoxville due to higher, rates of abuse and Knoxville objection you know it's not my understand, if any idea was understand came from then as expressed in this email,it is says what it says and it appears to be limited to that timeframe of July 25th 2013 so I don't know specifically what was going on at that time and Knoxville did you believe what you wrote here was true and accurate the DEA had been involved in limiting quantities opioids being shifted to Knoxville to to high rates of abuse ejection lack of foundation Sims of fact I do, I don't recall what I would have thought at that point you don't know whether you believe the tiny made this statement whether that was accurate same objections I don't know if it was active or Not Looking Back and I don't know if you ever did you ever learn later that the your observation here about the DEA limiting shipment of opioids in to Knoxville due to high rates of abuse was accurate, did you ever hear about the limiting shipments of opioids in to Knoxville due to high rates of abuse was accurate answer I don't recall that, observation here I really am at a loss on what I can actually do when other factors are now putting the screws on the area due to the high abuse we have here through that correctly States okay what are the other factors that you refer to here now putting the screws on the area due to the high abuse we have here, Junction I don't recall what those other factors would have been, and you say due to the high abuse we have here are you reporting someone else's observation or is that your observation, that would not be my observation I never observed that, so you're saying as of the date of this email July 25th 2013 you didn't have an opinion as to whether or not opioid abuse was relatively high in the Knoxville area, not specifically in Knoxville again to our comment earlier something common knowledge across the United States had been for a long time, did you ever have understanding working at Mallinckrodt weather, hope your abuse in Appalachia was higher relative to the nation as a whole Justin something that you do not recall being aware of it at any point working for Mallinckrodt Junction I never recall hearing the word Appalachia what about just in Tennessee do you recall strike that do you recall whether you had the understanding why you worked at mallik Road, got that rates of abuse of opioids in Tennessee was higher relative to the rest of the nation, which action no comparison your goal having understanding where you worked at Mallinckrodt whether the piece rate for opioids with relatively higher in East Tennessee compared to other areas in the nation, would having some understanding about the abuse rates in Knoxville, or upper east Tennessee or Tennessee in general, whatever something you'd be considered valuable knowledge, why you were selling melon krauts popular product in your Knoxville market share action, no sir, why would that not have been valuable to you, traction because I prescribed educated positions on these all go for an appropriate patient that's not an appropriate patient, it's being used, do you ever make an effort, to try and gain some awareness or understanding about opioid abuse rates in Knoxville relative to the rest of the nation, objection, and that was never Strike that the rate of abuse of opioid products in Knoxville or Tennessee generally, there were a topic of, training or instruction for Mal Grand gesture, hope you would abuse with topic of training because that was part of the Black Box warning so yes it was part of the training my question is specific though to the rate of abuse of opioid products at Knoxville Tennessee was that in topic of training or instruction from a Lacroix checks into the Tennessee being singled out, what's protecting the script mean, I'm not sure exactly what I would have meant then, today that would to me I felt understanding that, wanted to make sure the prescription was able to go through that a buzz term or phrase that was used frequently at Mallinckrodt protect the script no not that I recall you'll recall seeing it in other emails or Communications from Alcott employees Jackson, I don't recall, last two, let's take a short break we going off the Record at 5:48, okay we're back on the record and 556 if you are you know how much longer do you think we had I just said I had two more documents that's it the scorecard robots say we have two more documents thank you for hanging in

close to being she stated that many of them want to do what is right blowing pill counts do using exhaust go, and dismissing patients that test with illegal drugs in your system she was told by the owners who are chiropractors that is running patient's up that is running patients off and that each patient needs to receive and quote ample amount of oxy Roxy Toro Panama to keep them happy and returning she also told me that it was discouraged by the owners to prescribe things all go, thank you again she's discussing the prescribing that's going on at beard and Healthcare correct objection, according to what she stated here yes you know did you know the owners were a beard and Healthcare at this time I don't recall any reason dispute that they were chiropractors as she represented on the phone call not to the best of my knowledge and what she's telling you is that, doing what is right according to the owners of beard and Health Care was running patients off correct ejection that appears to be heard understanding and at the owners, told her the patients need to receive a quote ample amount, foxy Roxy oral pain to keep them happy and returning that's what she told you objection, I don't recall specifically you're telling me that but that's what it states used ample in quotes is that quote from from Teddy Jackson I don't recall so you don't recall what you meant

was really nice yeah what about you damn what were you thinking yeah I think the concepts excellent that it's basically trying to help out the defenseless smokers this point it ain't like basically turning your son to closet smokers when you guys get the comments they don't mind you smoking just don't exhale but I thought it was very unique, meek and a new wave of where the smokers going to go I was concerned about the flavor and it tastes because primarily that's what I like about it but the camels I do find a difference between camels Winston's and lights and Ultras and those kind of things that I've tried in the past that was pretty important also what do you think did you have a night did you guess like what it would taste like no no I I tried both the Menthol Island and I'm going to fall just to try both of them during, class I used to smoke cools years ago the irritated my throat put me back to the non menthols okay what and I'll just keep going with you Dan what was it like them that first time I think you got to try and in those groups as what did you think the other startup was tough you know basically they told us that was like a cigar and of the women fared because they don't fucking smoke too many cigars but you got to really draw hard to get it going, and to me it seemed like I had to draw a hard to keep it going the flavor was different what I kind of turned it back to was like like when they're Fantage first came out it had a like a twang to it and a little bit of a bite and that's probably the only thing that really would be negative on my side would be the flavor leaves a little bit after bike, kind of like maybe smoking a cigar, okay what about you Teresa what was your I mean when you were in there and you try to counsel well it was awfully hard to life is hard to smoke and it's like some kind of smoke all over again that it's real hard to smoke what did you think about the taste when you finally tasted well I normally smoke like cigarettes and the light when I try there's no flavor at all because I didn't think that was so I went back to try the full flavor that's a little better, okay that much not much not much now now I'm not I like the whole idea that I really do and I hope they can improve on it somehow but it's too hard to smoke you smoke at you just like I'm on a cigarette now I want a real cigarette I think I'm playing so it's your case is not really satisfying yeah I totally agree I smoked them with my camels you know I'll tell you the alternating back and forth, It's like what like playing yeah it's like okay now I want to put my break now or a real cigarette yeah what now how much you took two packs of them I think as a first step right and then a carton or did you just take the car just the car card okay so both of you have some of the carton you didn't know okay I can't ask you this when you smoke the car, what did you notice anything different like the people notice that this it was a different kind of cigarette that you show it to anybody I got a lot of comments everybody that was near me when I was smoking had a comment it was very much A Conversation Piece a couple folks had to try it never quite finished it the biggest thing was Secretaries Day was that week and we had non smoker smoking, the girls that don't smoke or when I post with lunch and we went for going to go to a non-smoking table for then we got the smoking table and I'm passing these out amongst the people that place and the restaurant kind of thought maybe what are they smoking in passing around over there because we were all talking and really going on about the cigarettes and really became a attraction of like eight people in the corner of Steak and Ale so it they they commented like the same thing it's too hard to do, draw part about a few comments that got everybody's attention about how hard to have to draw did anyone in particular I mean did was there a range was there anyone that would just liked it that right there any I don't think so they all the smokers preferred they were are all like Winston regulars Winston selects they smoke the regular not the lights and the girls don't smoke at all they were ever kind of they weren't gagging enough, thing but they never like this is different they all thought it was unique that we laid in the ashtray and there wouldn't be any smoke or the thing that they never got smaller as like how do you know when you're done, how do you how would you answer something like that if someone asked you how do you know what I've done basically I said there's no more smoke left I had several it tried to relight it and nothing came out and now you're done okay just a second, let me just, you were talking about when you know they're done you were talking about when you when you know it was done or when you don't do these let's say I'm here your friend I come up and I say well they last as long as a normal cigarette so pretty much I put the three to five minutes is basically what I saw and what they told us it would last and that's about what it lasted I didn't really try the thing they said you could lay it down for two or three minutes and pick it back up generally I don't blame my cigarettes, down even even normal ones generally hold on to him and I draw them more often than that but I found the last about 45 minutes what about you Teresa did you get an opportunity to show these to anybody I think your way, how's the girls that wear I didn't like them of course as long as they only had 12 pack on my first impression was good what do you how do you I mean what would you say to him whenever they see it first or would you say hey look at this new cigarette well they knew I was coming here to start with for the survey and so they wanted to try it and, what they thought of it to anyone or I was really interested in like how do you how did you start the conversation and say hey guess what yeah what time with your survey and they understand the cigarette smoke free no ashes and what were their reactions there were always the same no one really yeah I'll be okay and what was the biggest was it taste now because you had to draw too hard on you really I mean, give it a light in it they can get anything at all and I'm your smoke on it have to be lighted and play with the quite a bit to get it to light up the women that had to try to have more problems with the taste and then was worried about him going out some of them thirst thought that was a cigarette load in the end it's going to blow up it's a gag cigarette maybe like don't like I'm smoking one you're waiting and you're waiting he's pretty good, do you is this something I can address me earlier today when we were talking with it that a lot of non are we're getting a lot of pressure smokers are getting a lot of pressure from the fact that there's a secondhand smoke and this is a gret is able to reduce secondhand smoke a lot is it you know where does it come fit into the picture of what's going on out there today and I like we're talking about earlier as a cigarette that does reduce secondhand smoke, Italy where where does this fit in I think of restaurants main issue with areas that are basically going smoke-free totally The Smokers aren't taking the business they're they're going elsewhere I think they would try to track that business back I know for a fact many airports with lounges in the bars where they used to crowd everybody to smoke that they would make you you couldn't stand and smoke yet that have a Coke appear or something, spending money now these lounges are empty when I walk through them now they're really being hurt or business is down 40 to 60% from the bartender's I've talked to and they're kind of lobbying to get smoking back because the tip money do you think this plate would play a role in there yes I think that would isolate that area again where we used to be with the crowded smoke-filled rooms that would be reduced down because that seemed to be the biggest complaint that wasn't the Smoke Filled rooms they would still allow us to, set there and smoke, what about you Teresa you see this the cigarette but what I don't think it will I don't think anybody's gonna it's non-smoking now I don't think they'll ever go back and say okay you can smoke if you smoke this new cigarette I don't see that ever happening what about I mean you guys have it sounds like most people that you showed it to really didn't like it that much, I'm curious in the group that you were in when you came in here and talk to that what was the reaction of the group do you remember next time what who do you think the cigarette is for who do you think would like to cigarette it you can you think anybody people smoke in their own homes they don't like it if you have kids maybe new smoke in the house they'll like it or people that smoke in the car because they don't want the glitter in the car, under green okay um is this a cigarette that if you were going to want to put that you're watching this video and you're working back from Winston-Salem on this this cigarette getting the clips ready do you Market this cigarette, this is a cigarette that should be out on the market because it reduces the second hand smoke by seven lines and has some benefits to he's check-in I'm going to improve it a little first make it easier to like make it easier lines of you know it's easier to smoke somehow enhance the flavor I think it's very well Market, do you think it's from marketable right now if we put it on the market tomorrow to think of itself probably not the they would initially go because of the concept and uniqueness but primarily I smoked for the flavor that's not so much the drawing on it or the toughness but the flavor of feeling it satisfied my craving okay Teresa you said that you had showed it to, see people I guess at work right did you show it to anybody else or did I'm curious did anyone stop either one of you two and actually notice it without you bringing it up yes it is tell me about that how does that happen and what was what went on like what kind of conversation went on well this fellow is a nonsmoker and his wife smokes and he's basically kind of rides her all the time and he rides the used to be our plant manager and I was sitting directly beside him and he was noticing, saying that I wasn't burying him to smoke because he generally tries to scoot away from you like we smoke it I started telling him about it and he fixed it up and thought what kind of kind of neat course I told her put down on the napkin to look as any burning anything he thought it was pretty neat idea, but his thoughts ours no smoking at all he's quick 30 years ago or whatever and he's preaching to his wife to quit I did find that during that time period of that week I smoke probably 30 to 40% more than I normally would because I had the interim of my camels in between which is back to that satisfaction thing, okay so I'm curious let's say out of the cities around on the market today would you buy an average week how much they how many cigarettes how many packs do you smoke a day one pack two facts are about to practice Japan okay added so that means seven days just about 14 packs out of this 14 packs which is smoked any eclipse the pack of eclipses are numb during the period of the 10 packs of Clips I smoke probably five, two six-packs of camels along with which is a little bit more than what I generally spoke is how it varies from time to time because we're smokeless at work and depending on if I'm outside of our plan or not I smoke more or I smoked half of them's which increases the Pack level today of a smoking area at your work I mean like a slight a designated smoking area yes did you smoke any of these eclipses in there what were people saying I mean people, just that you were smoking they want to try him so maybe I didn't smoke as many of the of the full carton I did probably passed out during that interval maybe up to two packs during that time frame when you gave the cigarettes to people what would you say to just try it around to explain like the fact that parents sometimes I would tell them because they would see the white pack or the no name on it like what are they expand they start asking questions and some I would answer in some I would like to find out in the room and just asked what they thought of them, and do my own little survey and and so that's what you were talking about earlier we're not not in I guess no one liked them so your flavor they didn't care for the growing part is about it but other than that they sell they like the uniqueness the single ones thought they were vague great conversation pieces of bringing up conversation, and of course others that have the spouse at home that doesn't like that the smoke thought it was great, but they didn't back to The Taste and hard to draw Sierra, what which of the government's attitude be toward Reynolds in this cigarette should because right now the government's pretty clear on how they stand on smoking I mean you can't smoke in any public buildings airports like you had mentioned the military you can't smoke in the military anymore which of the government's position Beyond cigarette like this should it be any different than any other cigarette like they were probably going to a bunch of testing, the biggest factor is the the glycerin difference in the tar and nicotine there are pushing for my house standpoint on the individual as well as the second hand smoke and driving it with the secondhand smoke people, okay what do you what do you think I mean what does it what should what stations from government, is there any different than any other cigarette how they should research it I think make sure it's okay but I do think that we should be like to smoke somewhere course of what say you and I can't see them saying you can smoke the eclipse in this little area but you can't smoke in one instance I don't think that's right at all I don't think I'll do that, I guess it's it unless guys do you have any questions mark thank you all I hope that what you

Khan plumber it, this is today to find a mascot for a new brand of cigarettes right what's your angle I'll buy that let's do lunch who does she think she's dealing with hmm now then we're looking for someone who represents cool you don't have what it takes actually Rock I think I'm pretty versatile have you ever thought about the way to back a company's betray people who smoke their brand of cigarette well let's take a look at this, this ad from the past where you have a beautiful lady long luscious legs curvaceous and Bodacious body in a beautiful blue bikini standing on a package of cigarettes it seems that women who smoke are an object of sex but that was not always the case did you know that at the turn of the century it was in fact illegal for women to smoke in public so next time you pick up an American Magazine containing an ad saying you've come a long way baby you should ask yourself how do you come a long way have you liberated your cell phone, the laws of the past or have you just exchange it for a new type of repression and addiction and what about this side here we have a now that makes it seem that smoking after a long workout is actually a healthy choice I find that ironic don't you okay so Society has now said no more smoking the workplace number smoking the malls no more smoking in the community centers, and what have the tobacco companies come and then it seems that they're directly answering this type of restriction it seems that they're saying go ahead cheat smoke in the workplace just hang that cigarette out the window it's okay no one will notice and if you can't find a place to kick back and have one last drag you can always put down to Joe's place where there's music there's dancing there's pool and can always find people who smoke just like you so the next time you pick up an American Magazine containing tobacco a, dad's you should ask yourself what images are the tobacco companies trying to sell you, can't you buy into the images and Lifestyles that tobacco companies present no I don't want to be the Marlboro Man when I first started smoking I think that the I did buy into the images over totally like manipulative whenever you see a cigarette ad it's always young healthy people having a good time relaxing sort of a thing to make it look a little refreshing the cool things that don't think what the average smoker they have Lego yellow teeth in our fingers they smell gets into the, clothes and their hair and mucus and coughs I hope I don't ever get like that maybe I'll be able to put it for that, anyway when I started smoking you know it's great sport glad I'm preparing Bogart smoke Clark Gable Cary Grant, very romantic, so you smoke all right we've got G simple Toronto Jason hello how you doing man you're on what's up nothing much I think he feels pretty cool hey there's a lot better right so we want got a question comment I think the ad where the people are diving into the pool so ineffective it's really stupid right now what do you think is ineffective about that story I said what do you think is in effect of about that what bothers you about that, I don't think it will stop people from smoking mmm it's just a dumb message right okay well one thing that I think they wanted people to think about when they made that ad is that it will not make anybody stop smoking I think that you smoke yourself Jason no okay well I think there's a lot of people who when they see an ad like that it's not meant so much to stop somebody from smoking but more to get somebody who might big might start smoking to maybe think twice before doing it I think that a you know like a lot of guys they look at that and say okay yeah sure, and then I'm going to do anything about that right is a good look at it laughs but the find a lot of younger people how will you I'm 13 okay I can see how you might find a lot of guys you know preteens you know 11 12 they look at that and make me think twice about about smoking so just something to think about all right his record I appreciate it okay thanks all right right now we're going to take Ken from Stratford Ken hello all right can what's up man not or what all right you got a question comment I got a comment it's kind of like Jason's right I kind of find Those ads that say smoking is really, a bad kind of offenses right y so well with my friends even said the same thing about it is me not like that one I decide you put on a boat I was about 10 minutes ago right let's go well with the people jumping into the water right thing all these chemicals and everything in there hmm do you really think your salt that they have smokes have all those chemicals in them well this is true I mean there are a lot of chemicals that there are like tons of chemicals in cigarettes I mean that's what makes it addictive I think that's one of the things that they want people to know about because, fact that cigarettes are how do you say Well they're addictive right they make sikander that and that's why they want people to know about it let's ask me me is 17 years old and she smokes and what do you think what those ads I think that they're good for prevention but I'm not so sure if they're good for making people quit right and cigarettes do have a lot of they make you aware they do have a lot of chemicals in them things insane things like toilet bowl cleaner and Arsenic and stuff like that right so I think that the ads are good for prevention but I'm not so sure about all right quit, doing okay that's cool thanks a lot hey I hope that helps you out there man thanks a lot okay all right take care right now we're going to get to our first Adventure a stick girl, the bottom of the sea a I'll be dead in your lap before the, age of 50 I

in the recent games now for those of you that may or may not know that what happens in those video games you see that when their Billboards flashing by they're all tobacco ads something to think about another thing to think about is what happens where your money is going to whenever you're buying products from your favorite stores for example Shoppers Drug Mart everything you want out of draw cat cat, sing the song that very well in the spelling mistakes Shoppers Drug Mart Hulk smash I know but it's interesting to note that these guys are a subsidiary the same guys Mike Brown & Williamson cigarettes it's a Kool cigarettes Capri cigarettes also Lucky Strike something to think about craft when having we had some crab dinner or they'll be two slices be a little bit Cool Whip well these guys have seen here the Philip Morris International Company Marlboro Virginia Slims Benson & Hedges Merit Alpine iPhone around Oreos sweet innocent tasty with milk with ice cream these, guys have seen the error of RJR McDonald incorporated as export a that's Vantage that's McDonald specials think about it guys we got a call Karen from Bradford yeah hi hey you don't care I'm pretty good I was just wondering why like most of the smoking add that I seem like around there are all directed towards young women and girls and I think that's kind of like I don't see all girls smoking I see a lot of guys smoking to so which adds any particular ad you think is, and specifically a girls well mostly like Virginia Slims well pretty well I seen we did a unit on smoking in school and we studied a lot of advertisements right and most of them were directed at young women right we see what they're doing is that they're trying to play off this thing where women need to be this is their way of being empowered and it is a crock I think I mean maybe you like to come in on this well yeah they have that their slogan is you've come a long way baby as if cigarettes have have, brought about social change for women which is silly women did it on their own they don't need cigarettes to become independent or liberated you see so I mean if you really want to show that women are empowered when you take your power clock him in the head they're idiots all right they for the call we appreciate it we can take another phone call we've got Mike from Sudbury Mike that's your Batman I'll be you pretty good all right can you turn down your TV little bit little bit of feedback are not be out here man you got a question comment I got a comment all right I was just saying that, moti Add feel like to the younger generation so I've been like smoking since I was like a little kid right and I just like steak everybody wants to smoke this like don't try to anything because it will ruin your life huh and I think that's pretty stupid for everybody who tries it right and like all the commercials they should be feel like the older generation to try to quit right and not just to the younger generation if you could change one thing in advertising what would you do I would just make it for older people, we're a man thanks a lot appreciate the call they take care of him and what do you think about that I think cigarette advertising is definitely directed to young kids especially Joe Camel there's big controversy over his he's a cartoon character you know and who reads cartoons yeah precisely as a matter of fact is a fact that ever since Joe Camel the cartoon cows being used the people like young kids were recognizing that from 1 percent to 30 percent like 30% higher and that's quite a fact right now it's, for mister conglomerates, what's your angle I'll buy that let's do lunch yeah whenever freezes over so let me get this straight you want to be our new mascot right the other guys already have someone who looks just like you you're wasting my time my hump isn't it well this is what I get when I listen to my agent and larger hump she says you'll get more work cigarette ads are banned in Canada but a loophole in the law still allows tobacco companies to use their corporate logo when sponsoring events that's one heck of a loophole, the hidden ways that the great companies promote their products are like putting their name on cultural events such as more digestible through sporting events layers and Rahman sponsored tenant in 1991 the Canadian tobacco industry spent more than 40 million dollars on cultural programs and projects hydrogen cyanide what do these deadly poisonous have in common, Mayhem they are some thousands of chemicals found in a widely used product line of these poisons include many cancer-causing substances are a Lo hará they found dive in Zach in cigarette smoke tobacco industry has a very serious multi billion dollar problem everyday

people smoke in there and everything and it pisses me off that just sounds like we're being pissed off is in consideration on their part I'm FR you I think what I would do is me who do you

to Joe sent you all right okay okay take care all right okay now while we were looking at the ads from our California me now what do you think of the the ad with everybody gathered around the table you know act like a bunch of done what do you think of that I think that was such an effective ad I really like that because it was funny but it was also it kind of made you realize that smoking companies really don't care about your, your health or what you're about they just want to make money and that's really what all they're interested in not at all if anybody gets a chance on that topic I want you guys to take a peek at yesterday's Sunday star it's a great article by Judy Steed and we appreciate her giving us the opportunity to show this on air take a look at this yesterday it's like all about that stuff you really like it right now we're getting a call we got Kristen Oakville Chris alright what's up man how you doing I'm pretty good I have a comment all right actually I've been seeing all these, as and stuff in magazines Etc and if they always portray young people as being cool if they smoke and getting lots of friends and I just want to say that that is just so untrue I mean I see a lot of people at my school they just sort of stay away from people smoke because I mean they stink and everything and I just don't think it's pretty horrible the way that weight they portrayed as being cool to smoke right it's not that precisely I think you just hit the nail right on the head man thanks for the call we appreciate it right, now it's time for The Adventures of

pretty extensive at the work out for a while because first tied up okay I think that's right as you can see we've got a cigarette that's being pushed into the earth the earth is kind of an ashtray we appreciate this kind of stuff want to keep this kind of stuff come in and write because we really enjoy can see that here just a little bit like it loving it all right Amy we were looking at some of the images that we see in advertising now let's talk about, movies now we do this in a lot of movies recent movies old movies that smoking is glorified smoking looks well you said let's do one moving particular Blade Runner Blade Runner was Sean young boy she gorgeous and and she looks so good I'm sure she'd like to put a million cigarettes during that movie and she just looks so cool smoking and she doesn't get cancer Midway through the movie and she looks cool throughout the whole thing with that cigarette in her mouth I mean like what kind of images I mean that you know as somebody who smokes mean do you when you look at that and you see that, image like what registers in your mind was that like triggered oh smoking is beautiful smoking is cool and you know when you're sitting at parties or whatever and there's like a cute guy whatever across the room you know you're doing the whole you know type actress type thing and you know it really is you sort of associate coolness with movies like that that's another movie were talking about where the Lethal Weapon movies you know Mel Gibson Danny Glover you know the voice and it's like every second seat you see Mel Gibson in is a no-smoking sign in the, background and he's like just popping his guard puffing away hotel and he's it's like the same thing for men you know he's a total rugged Man you know on his own stands up fights evil people you know and so he sort of portrays that that image for boys a movie there was thinking of Superman he flies into the Marlboro trips no mistake yeah and that's like totally manipulatives you'll find that in a lot of movies what advertisers are doing is that they're buying spots in the movies to show their cigarettes show their products and what, want to do that is that it's their own free advertising they stick it in to them although they are paying a lot of money it was just recently that it came out that someone Sylvester Stallone's movies that huge wads of money were being paid in order to get their cigarette brands into the movie in a Superman to you've got the the Man of Steel he's brewing his way out of a Marlboro cigarette truck and does just the image of you know him coming out Supernatural Superfly super cool breaking through it's something that really wears on kids and so I think we really have to think about, there are so many other movies as well I'm thinking about some of the James Bond movies as well like cigarettes they paid something like six figures in order to get those like cigarettes put into the movie now you look at this kind of stuff and you say alright this manipulation it's it's so blatantly obvious it's not that they have to look at and movies in advertising as well as you know in the magazines and something to remember something to think about now we've been looking at a lot of the images and a lot of the themes that I mean as far as the, smoking ads what would you consider a good smoking that well I really like that one from California the one where they're all sitting around the table and saying you know we're not in this for our health type thing some I guess I guess telling you what's in cigarettes that the anti-smoking ads that tell you what since I got sort of are pretty effective for sort of prevention and stuff like that right but I'm not I mean for me I like to know more about sir, out of what what cigarette companies try to do to manipulate you know I think that would help me quick cool and Terry oh you're jamming our line so I think we'd better get the stick girl hit it, this, so what's your angle I'll buy that let's do lunch there's another quick million dollars it just never lets up around here I like your style kid I think we can cut a deal that sounds swell when can I start hold

hfxh0257,"okay, so this is an email between you and Victor Borelli and the email Adam interested in is on five six four three two seven and five six four three two eight and the starting Bates numbers M and Katie 1564 327 so could you review that email for completes you, okay so this email is from Victor to you and he says Kate I was thinking about our conference call this morning with John Adams and I wanted to Circle back with you on both instances in which you say I did things that compromised your trust in me and see that I do you recall receiving this email from Victor I do okay and what do you recall about this email I don't recall the content of the email but I do remember I remember having this conversation we had a call with him and with John Adams that morning, I didn't remember that I didn't remember the context but I do remember making the statement of losing trust with Vic and then him sending this email to me later in the evening at 9:30 so I remember this situation occurring for sure and do you recall why you why you indicated that you lost trust in him that's the part that I that I was more vague on I'm reading it and he gives he gives the reasons why which give, recollection but I wouldn't have remembered this otherwise but do you do recall a phone conversation with him and John Adams Adams were you indicated that you were I was upset I was I was upset about something yes okay and it caused you to lose trust in him so that it caused me to question a decision that he had made yes okay, did you have any concerns that he was providing information with his distributor customers that you shouldn't be so do you read the paragraph, they kept asking it so it looks like we if you read the email it says the second instance was more recent than was on the shipment status of the Masters recent large oxy 30 mg orders and this was on June 5th and so that's you know a day after, the The Exchange that we have on June 4th internally so we were holding these orders we weren't shipping them at the time because we were trying to determine you know determine if we could take on the business what we were going we were going to do and we had asked according to him, we had asked to keep that you know we were trying to have that conversation internally before we communicated anything to the customer and looks like from this email, he went ahead and move forward with telling Masters the discussions that we are having now you had asked him not to do this correct wide said that we wanted to according to this it looks like I had said we wanted to keep the conversations internal, I don't remember the conversation specifically but based on his response that appears to be what I had said and you don't have any reason to believe that his characterization of the second instance is inaccurate, can you explain what you mean well you do you recall asking him to keep your confidence your internal conversations confidential I I don't like I said I don't recall that but reading his response indicates that that's what I had said okay and you don't have any reason to believe he would be lying about that no because I remember I remember this conversation at least high level okay, and so you would ask them to keep information confidential and he apparently disregarded that request that fair he went ahead and shared with the customer he has to do you recall other instances where he did that this one particular step with me I don't have a recollection of other occasions, but is it fair to say that as a general matter you had some concerns about his reliability Visa Vee they can get the information he was sharing with his customers I checked him yeah I don't think that we can we can say that based on this this one email exchange I and I don't this like I said this one instance I do remember that I don't have any recollection of others, but you were certainly upset about this instance weren't you, I was upset yes and I mean John Adams was Vector barelli's boss that's correct so it was it was sufficient concerned you that you raised this with him I think you know and I do remember this conversation this is 2008 so I would have been, 29 years old this point and I think back on this actually because this was something that stuck with me through my career this conversation and I think a lot of, it might have just been maturity be honest with you well you say that this this conversation or something while I'm sorry you your testimony is because this was something that stuck with me through my career this conversation so this this conversation stuck with you through your career so I remember it yes unlike a lot of the things that we review today where it was there is not a from recollection sure so what made this conversation stick with you I think because I realized that you really, I think as I realized the relevance of calling someone out that that hard and not having it in front of their boss and not having a direct conversation with them so I think that that was a Miss on on my part in terms of how I handled it and that's something that stuck with me and I'm sure you have those two or you thought about things that you could have done differently and handled differently and it impacts how you manage those relationships going forward, so what what sticks out at you is your reaction yes 100% yeah that's why I didn't really remember the content of it but I remembered this this happening, and actually looking looking at the sentences or the bottom of 5643 27 and the top of five six four three two eight, when I was discussing the server with Masters I explained to them that their order size immediately raised concerns throughout our entire organization they understood the rationale behind this based on their purchasing history but their bone of contention was that they weren't getting any direction or information about their orders they kept asking probing me with more questions about why customer service didn't get back to them and why nobody can get back to them that sought answers on their order status so in response to to Victor sharing with them these internal discussions did man, stirs complaint, Masters had Place their orders and we had not shipped the orders and customer service was not communicating to them status so it appears that according to this that they complain to Victor about not having an update on what was happening with their orders, do you recall why you wanted this conversation we cure these conversations we kept confidential because we hadn't made a decision yet on what we were going to do and so until we had that we didn't want to communicate yay or nay to Masters on what was happening and Victor as a national account manager wanted to ship and he, take to the farm, yeah I can't speak to what Victor wanted to do is Victor's job in sales I was in marketing and so I can't speak to what he wanted to do but he did have an account asking where their orders were and he they didn't have answers and he was getting a lot of pressure from from them to have answers, and so would one reason for him to share this information with Masters which prompted Masters to you know start complaining be to you know put apply some pressure to make a decision and ship the order object to the form yeah I think that's there's a lot of speculation there I can't I can't speak to to what Victor you know what he did or didn't feel or do on this, but the end result is that you know putting aside the emails the order did ship, did it, I don't think we have any documentation actually showing that the order shipped,so this email chain is from June 6 of 2008 and this email chain is as of September 15 2008 Yes and I can just read into the record it's enemy Katie 1562 745 and it's an email exchange between you and Victor Borelli another things and you right to em you're way too energetic about this shipping thing and part of his response is you know ship ship ship so previously you had indicated that Victor was, if you recall that my did characterized and that way when our initial conversations this morning and he was aggressive in trying to serve service his distributor customers Affair he advocated for his customers okay I guess what I'm asking you though is you asked me specifically now it's me that's going to get specific but you asked me specifically on whether this order shipped and then you produce this document and know this document doesn't address whether that order, okay that's why I thought you were that was the question that I had for you in terms of it you know so yes it to clarify that this this document doesn't indicate whether that orders shipped okay I have another document to be be honest I haven't found it so okay moving on yeah you know my question is just about you know Victor Borelli and his aggressiveness which I believe you indicated sure do you believe he was more aggressive than other National count, managers or were they kind of had the same objective and the same the same you know approach um I think they all had very individual approaches to how they manage their accounts but they were all focused on the relationship with the distributor and the including you know shipping the product to them they were yes they were there to manage the relationship with the customer and Advocate on their behalf, yeah that was their job to manage that relationship and so did some degree was there some tension between the national account managers and the compliance Department I can't speak to that I wasn't part of compliance so I don't know if there was or wasn't tension there, did you ever observe any tension in your role as essentially you know conduit or an information provider to compliance I honestly I don't don't recollect know, so this is an email from Kathy Stewart to Bill Ratliff and caring car per your Nazi seat on it but I did want to ask about the very top so the top email is an email from Kathy Stewart to go and Karen and she says FYI the customer service reps all state that Victor will tell them anything they want to hear just so you get the sale dot dot dot dot dot okay do you see that I do okay you agree with that statement I I don't know because I wasn't in customer service, okay then this is my first time seeing this document as I was not involved in this conversation, do you recall any concerns, by anyone regarding, Victor and you know the accuracy reliability of the information he was providing the context of I really thought I really don't have a recollection around that and like I said this is the first time that I've, scene, yeah I don't have any recollection no well you know Kathy Stewart though right do you think that you would generally reliable, I can only speak to my interactions with her but I think you know when we spoke I think she's she is a yeah I think she's reliable and she cared about the company then she I think we all did I can't speak to to Kathy specifically,so this is an email between you and Victor vasarely and then Victor vasarely and Stephen Cochran it is MKT 1384 139, and do you know who mr. Cochran is or was I do who was he he was the buyer at Key Source okay and so you are providing Victor Borelli with chargeback information on oxy 30 aren't you yeah can you just give me an opportunity because it's hard to read and respond on just a second,okay, so this email involves chargeback data or chargeback information chargeback data was considered confidential at mallik Road wasn't it, I don't know the answer to that, I don't know so do you don't have any recollection as to whether Mallinckrodt was willing to share its chargeback data with other Market participants we typically would not share competitive chargeback data with customers and so when Victor Borelli is email is forwarding this information to Cochran and he says p as shh I mean is that mean that that's because he wasn't supposed to be providing him with this information was he, I can't I'm not sure, let's see here, mmm, okay, so is this another example of mr. Borelli sharing information with a distributor client that he shouldn't be talked on the phone I can't I don't know I'm not sure well this email chain indicates that he didn't ask you if you could share this definitely you know it does indicate that yes,I don't know if we had a conversation on this it I don't I don't recollect this okay and I'm sorry just to sort of clarify the question yes sir the the email chain does not indicate that he was he ever asked you if he could share this he didn't not and he did not be an email within this chain right and you don't recall him asking you in a phone conversation I don't have a recollection of this entire email chain so I don't recollect if there was or wasn't a phone call, so thank you can you can put that document aside, so in terms of I mean, recognize that we've been we've been going at this for some time and over the course of this deposition we've reviewed numerous documents relating to the relating to suspicious orders do you recall that, we have reviewed a lot of documents yes so in terms of your you were the product manager for oxycodone from 2008 to January 2011 correct so that's around a three-year time period okay do you recall how many suspicious orders suspicions order reviews that you are involved in no I don't recall terms of a rough estimate could it be would you say it's 100 I, I seriously I that is really difficult for me to estimate I can't do that well okay presumably it's more than like 20 though right it would be more than 20 okay, fair to say more than 50 I think at this point it would be really difficult for me to give you a good estimate if I managed a product for two and a half years I think it would be really challenging given the number of orders that are processed even within let's say a given week I think it would be really challenging for me to I I can't estimate that for you but it would be a large number in terms of orders that we reviewed yes, terms of orders that were being reviewed by I can't estimate so it's hard for me to say what you know what large even means so well okay so it's more than 20 presumably, is there a number that you be comfortable saying it was under no because I don't even have a recollection of what the sheer scale of orders that we processed on a daily basis so for me to give you a ballpark on estimate on how many we reviewed would be that it's no I can't possibly provide you with that information okay so it could be 100 could be 500 could be 5,000 could be 50,000 you just don't have any way I don't have any way of quantifying that, do you recall ever advising that an order not ship I don't recall I do I don't this is all again 89 years ago actually further than that you're going back to 2008 I don't have a recollection of the order monitoring Port I don't have a recollection of that activity that I can share with you on the record that I'm definitive about I don't,though the night my question here is in terms of your recollection do you recall during that three-year time period that you were the product manager for Oxycodone ever advising that an order not ship and again I'm telling you that that was over 10 years ago from anywhere from 9 to 11 years ago and I don't have a firm Comfort level in terms of I don't remember but this was an important component of your job was a not it was a portion of my job in Oxy was one of the products that I made, managed so it was a component it was important but it was a smaller in terms of the scope of my job this was not everything that I did and again it was you know eight to ten years ago I really don't remember, but the oxycodone product was an important product for mallik Road I think you indicated it was a quarter of their of their sales and we did talk to that yes and so and there was there was clearly sensitivity by the DEA regarding the abuse of this product isn't that fair, was their sensitivity from the DEA yes there was clearly sensitivity by the DEA regarding the abuse of this product is that fair for me to confirm that statement I'm asking of you agree with that statement there was definitely as evidenced by the document so we went through there was a lot of focus on it by the DEA yes, and so you know this was clearly an important product for both you and Mallinckrodt it was an important product yes, and making sure that this product didn't end up or making sure that this product wasn't diverted was an important responsibility for you was it not I'm going to restate that this was eight to ten years ago that this happened you're asking me whether or not we stopped any orders or what my estimation is of the orders we evaluated I don't have a recollection, okay how much time do I have left great why don't we take a short break is 5:40 p.m. offer, so miss newly I went back and I looked at the real time and I just want to make sure that the record is clear on this you don't recall whether you did or did not ever say not to ship an order of Oxycodone is that correct, I don't know so it's possible that in your three years as a product manager for Oxycodone for Mallinckrodt you never said don't ship an order that's possible, I would say that we had a robust, Psalms suspicious order monitoring program in place that we adhere to we had a strong compliance team we all worked diligently to to make sure that we were doing the right thing as a whole I cannot speak to specifics with regards to orders and the percentage of orders that were reviewed the percentage that were held I can't speak to that, that and so I mean it it is possible then that in your three years as a product manager for Oxycodone you never said don't ship and work that's possible since I don't have a recollection that is possible and if you did say not to stop or if you did say not to ship in order that would be captured in an email wouldn't it, potentially, well when you say potentially what what do you mean by that it could be captured in the email it could have been a discussion that we had so the communication could have taken place I'm sure a number of different ways but there would be some written record of you stating or have you objecting to the shipment of an order correct again I'm just going to go back to the fact that we did have a good suspicious order monitoring program in place, that we were all working diligently to make sure that what we were shipping out the door was for you know for a good purpose I will also reiterate the product that we were shipping was going to a wholesaler and to a distributor so we were monitoring those orders and to the best of our ability we were you know adhering we were adhering to our program to flag suspicious orders what happens beyond that, you know when it got down to the to the customers customer and then you know down to then the doctor prescribing to the patient that was so far down the supply chain that that was definitely something that we wouldn't have the especially down to the doctor in the prescriber we wouldn't have the visibility into I would say that when the DEA made the statement about knowing your customers customers and you know as evidenced by the emails that you started to see more so in 2010, when we definitely were taking measures to try to figure out how to do that so from an overarching perspective I feel very confident that we were doing the right thing in terms of the orders and whether or not Waters were released whether or not orders were held documentation of that activity I can't speak to that I don't have a firm recollection of the details, so when you are a product manager you track the overall amount of Oxycodone and oxycontin and 30 that Mallinckrodt was providing to it's just it to its customers correct we created sales forecasts and budgets based on actual so yes did you ever become concerned with the volume of Oxycodone that Mallinckrodt was shipping, I wasn't necessarily concerned with the volume that we were shipping we were doing everything within our power to monitor orders and to comply with the dea's request in terms of submit suspicious order monitoring so it wasn't so much concerned with our shipment of orders because I feel like we were adhering and doing the right thing I did have questions about the market and the size of the overall market and trying to wrap my, my arms around what was happening within the oxycodone Market Downstream which was really challenging because we didn't really like I said we didn't have the visibility into that that portion I think what you saw from the emails then 2010 was us trying to understand what was happening and trying to take measures even further than what we'd already done with our suspicious order monitoring program which monitored the demand from our customers, switch was Distributors and wholesalers but I think you saw as digging and even further taking it a step further beyond what you somebody then proceeded to be on the the onus of the manufacturer to to really try to understand what was happening in the oxycodone market and so when you say you had questions about the market and the size of the overall market for Oxycodone on when did you have those questions um I would say that they we were starting you know so we we talked about, IMS and about the market data that's reported and so you could see your over your molecule growth so you can see what the total was happening with the total market and I can't remember I can't pinpoint the time when we started to look at it and a lot of it started to be honest with you because we were just trying to forecast you know we were trying to as a company trying to get a handle on what our forecast would be for this this product and we would use molecule growth rate for all products not just oxy to apply, that molecule to understand if it was growing if it was declining and then use that to you know calculate you know our market share off of to to come up with our sales budget and you know at that point in time I think the molecule growth rate was more like hey what's happening here I'm trying to project we were trying to project you know what our sales would be and the growth rate was faster than what we had forecasted and I think that that led us to start to look at things and say well why is that and, and then you know and again seeing the activity in 2010 as to when that initial like thought occurred I can't remember that and I would tell you if I could but it was definitely it was something that evolved over the course of time with us as a company in terms of understanding you know like I said we adhered to the suspicious order monitoring program that we had put in place we worked with the DEA we were doing everything, that we were supposed to be doing but this was something that it took a while to put all the pieces together on in terms of what was happening within the total market and then what was happening with our customer base and I would say it took time to finally see what the big that the whole all these pieces together what they meant and I think you see that in 2010 and I remember that's the part that I remember is in 2010 scene putting it all together starting, to see what was truly you know happening and taking action and that's that's the part that has stuck with me since I left the company I feel very strongly that we as a company did what we could and adhered to what was expected from the da the time to do the right thing with this with this molecule with with all of our all of our opioids and so when you say that you finally saw the, eager the whole pieces put together which was in 2010 what that whole picture was was that Mallinckrodt products were being diverted down stream was it not I can't and I can't speak to if Mallinckrodt its products were being diverted or not Downstream I don't know that because I don't know that there was ever a direct tie to I don't know I don't know that but what I can say is from a big picture perspective the oxy Market, had grown and it caused this to to dig into it more and whenever we did we started to identify the issues with the sales and to Florida the DEA was you know working very closely with Karen Harper and we when we finally started to put it together we realized that we shouldn't be selling to particular customers and we made that decision not to, I've I just said it's challenging for me to sit here today and I'm happy to go through all these emails with you and talk to them but it's challenging for me to see where we did anything wrong I mean we were trying to adhere to the not trying we were adhering to what the DEA requested from us and we were putting together programs you know and as you could see in the guidance that you provided to me from the DEA they didn't give specific instructions on how to how to do this you know there wasn't, they gave us high-level components on how to identify suspicious order but they never gave us like they basically left it to the manufacturers there was no one system that all manufacturers use to monitor you know suspicious order so it was up to us as a company to try to determine how to build out the system and I think what you've seen is that we worked really hard to do that and to to adhere to it so I don't know I don't know what else to say, well, based on the growth rate for Oxycodone you clearly had questions about that growth rate correct we that's what you we were we were trying to understand why the market was growing that fast yes and was one of the questions whether this groped wraith was reflective of diversion and medically inappropriate uses no I don't think that that was really in terms of when we were first seen the growth rate I don't think that that was so much on, on the radar at least for us in terms of that being that being a driver of the molecule growth rate I will say in 2010 when we started to dig into the data even more into the data and we were being asked to know our customers customer you have to understand we were just shipping into the distributor and the wholesaler and then they were internship being on to the pharmacies and so when we started digging into that that's when we started to put the pieces together but I, I well would you agree that sitting here today there is an opioid crisis in this country I think you've asked me that question already and it's on the record for my response and please refresh my memory them what is your response would you agree I said that I wasn't sure I don't know if there's truly an opioid crisis and the I don't know so you put together all the data you dig into the data in 2010 you assemble all the pieces of the puzzle but as you're sitting here you're you don't actually know whether, there is a problem with opioid abuse in the United States I've been so far removed from the situation I mean this was back open in my last my last month that Mallinckrodt was in January of 2011 and I haven't worked in the opioid industry since then what I can tell you as far as a company which is what we're here to talk about today is what Mallinckrodt did do or didn't do back in the time frame that I was there we did everything to the best of our ability to, to address two and two what's the right word for me what am I trying to say here, to to address what the da was sharing with us which at the time was sails into the State of Florida and Distributors who were selling to the State of Florida and the disproportionate amount and so we as a company did do that and we took the steps that we need to do as a company to at least control the piece that we had control over well but you weren't in the compliance Department correct I was not in the compliance Department warning the sales department I was in the marketing department Department, so you dealt with data so you don't you don't know that the DEA only talk to Mallinckrodt about the State of Florida I don't know that I think that you so much of your questioning was around the State of Florida today and that's why I specifically noted it and my conversation just now with you if we want to call this a conversation, hey but you don't you you don't know what the DEA was telling Mallinckrodt regarding opioids generally or other jurisdictions where it had concerns I can only address what I knew from my portion within marketing I saw all of our internal teams working strongly together to try you know to to make sure that I provided the right data to make sure that we were analyzing it working closely with Karen Harbor who was you know the head of compliance to ensure that, that we were meeting all you know being responsible as a company and ensuring that we were being responsible with the product that we were shipping out the door but when you say that Mallinckrodt did everything it could you're referring to your department and from a marketing and data standpoint is that it's not fair I'm speaking from a marketing perspective and I'm also speaking from what I was able to observe during my time there we had a specific suspicious order monitoring program that we adhered to Karen Harper was, legit and her team was diligent in terms of adhering to that making improvements figuring out how we could do better I witnessed that and so so as an overarching comment I would say that the company yes did everything it could to ensure responsibility within the marketplace but you have no idea how many Mallinckrodt products were diverted by Downstream customers do you owe my question is to you we, I have no way of knowing that there's absolutely no way of knowing that that's so far down the stream I mean you've got you've got doctors who are prescribing the patients and we don't know we don't know of those patients who know there's no way to know but the part that we had control over so we didn't have control over the doctors writing the prescriptions we didn't have control necessarily over the distributor selling to to pharmacies that you qualified potentially as pill Mills earlier but we did have control over, of us who we sold the product to and if we identified them as a customer who was problematic then we made that decision which obviously happened in the fall of 2010 to not sell to them so I think that we don't know what product was or wasn't diverting the market but of the piece that we had control over within the supply chain we did take the actions that we could to to be responsible in terms of distribution of our product are you aware that Mallinckrodt in, entered into a settlement agreement with the da or a memorandum of understanding not familiar with that I've not been with the company again for the past seven years so no I'm not familiar with that, okay okay so I'm done yep",0.8483896315315312,0.6161287,0.91283864,hfxh0257,Deposition of Kate Neely in RE: National Prescription Opiate Litigation; in 5 parts,lawsuit; legal

hghb0039,"hi there I'm that Leary as jimster are outlined in his letter contained with this video RJ R must reverse our full price trend in camlann select Our Best Bets to accomplish that goal this video is designed to explain to you how we're going to establish momentum on select quickly so how do we plan to do it and what makes us think it will work it takes two things and you got to have both and they are one, a better idea and to better programs camel is the best example of this one two punch I can think of Joe Camel was a better idea for a number of reasons but what really got the consumer to change their behavior where the ongoing incentives to buy camel with appealing premiums together the better idea Joe Camel and the better programs retail premiums got it done it took both so let's talk about select first we got to have it, idea something the brand can stand for we need to put something in the minds of consumers if we don't place a clear idea in their heads select will not work period okay so what must this idea do and more importantly how will we know it will work we use three criteria in its development and you should judge it in your own mind against these measures and they are is it unique is it meaningful and is it credible so what's the idea, Dia we are going to convince smokers that select is made better it's that simple so how's it made better it's made for better tobacco what's better about it it's perfectly aged what difference does that make aging is the key to smooth flavor just like fine wine or whiskey the back of Melos as it ages in a sentence select tobacco's demand perfect aging because, can't rush the flavor this is not unlike Folgers using only Mountain grown coffee beans because they make the richest tasting coffee mug lives are spent considerable time talking about their elusive be built a brand will be using three key elements to communicate with the primary one is Turtle which quickly says we took our time, second is our perfectly aged seal look for this to show up everywhere and lastly actual tobacco leaves which provide a lot of impacted interest for smokers you'll be seeing combinations of these elements in point-of-sale premium and Retail displays and it every communication love guava test is unique I can't think of another brand saying anything, like this most smokers have never even seen tobacco the me that represents an opportunity to make an impression in people's mind one that will stick is it meaningful we believe it strikes at the heart of value and people are more interested today and getting their money's worth than ever before and lastly is it credible from the start smoking tip always say collect sounds like make better why else would we have called it select so hopefully you'll agree, have an idea that can work but that's only half the battle they have the better idea of where the better program so the better program involves really engaging smokers and asking for the sale and involves something called personal selling it goes beyond hanging some point of sale running some ads and sitting back and waiting for it to work that strategy will not work anymore smokers just aren't that interested, we've got to turn up the heat with every encounter we've got to say hey I've got something important to say here stand here take a minute and pay attention we're explaining the select story to Consumers and then asking for a commitment at NASCAR races were not just saying here's a pack of Winston enjoy the race we're taking the time to give consumers a clear reason to switch to select one last point on this think about the reasons we've all heard people give as to why they smoke the brand they do we can list them on one hand, and I like the taste I always have my friends smoke it net net they don't have a lot of compelling reasons that's another opportunity we can provide them reasons to smoke select starting with all cigarettes are not created equal the tobacco makes a difference that makes sense to people you'll see this new approach in all of our programs so before I turn it over to Rick Sanders who will explain personal selling and more detail I'd like to say we think we have something here that can work, I believe we have a better idea and that our programs to bring that idea to life it won't happen overnight it will be a slow building process but if we stick with it and remain true to the idea I'm convinced we can make select work I hope you agree I'm Rick Sanders vice president of Cal marketing Services You Know Field sales is always had a promotional offer to give to competitive smokers that we meet at retail but if you're like me, you've always wondered if your consumer Mission efforts really made a difference and resulted in the switch well as never Larry told us a moment ago a good trial offer by itself just isn't as effective as they used to be converting dull competitive smokers it takes more and that's when personal cell phones in personal selling uses three critical steps rather than the one step of just making consumers at off first, you provide adult smokers with a real geek meaningful and credible reason to switch to our plan just like the product reasons net talk about uh select second as we've always done give them the opportunity to try our products right on the spot with an offer that's hard to turn down an offer such as our consumer Mission over, and third you invite them to join a program that provides intensive follow-up for initial contact getting these smokers into these follow-up programs means that your initial contact will be reinforced with that smoker over and over again by using all three of these steps in your personal selling efforts and making a big difference a big difference in smokers interest in our products and a big difference in smokers acceptance of, and that translates directly to share for Our Brands and increase claims the company now you may say well that sounds good but can I really make a difference well let me tell you in the average convenience store for competitive smokers have Pace wasteful Winston select the provide Winston one full SharePoint increase in essence more smokers one here, I think what personal selling that's very cool just think of how many smokers BC and I call each month and you can begin to realize what a powerful personal selling to be it allows you to do what you do best the cell are gr products to competitive smoker to retailers and the family and friends will provide you with the tools to make personal selling easy, and make it fun now one more thing before you begin this is three steps of personal selling with any smolder it's very important to follow 1ge guideline only approach smokers were 21 years of age or older if they look to be under the age of 30 make sure verbally verified at least 21 years old so as you've seen personal selling is a new, that can be used for all of our Brands but it can be particularly effective on our full price investment G camel and Winston select the demonstrations you're about to see will only address Winston select but as was mentioned earlier will be sending you a video on Camel in the coming months, now let's take a look first of all selling hi I'm Brian Stockdale senior Marketing Manager on the Winston camel business unit I know you're probably asking yourself how do I do this and still complete the rest of my responsibilities well first let me tell you the personal selling is an opportunistic program that has proven to work after 16 years with RJ are 11 and sales and five and marketing I know the issues you're going to face on personal selling, and it's not going to be easy and it won't work for every smoker don't get frustrated by Rejection it happens to all of us over 60 of us been practicing for about three months now and I've identified four key things that work best and make a difference in your approach they are number one never lead with have you tried it often leads to immediate rejection number to start with friends cashiers people you know to become, more comfortable with the message number three know the story about select so you don't end up reading from brochure number four be confident comfortable and committed to making a difference there are also five key things that are important to smokers they are different tobacco is what makes cigarettes taste different and we're to Winston select tobacco is aged to Perfection like fine wine or whiskey number 3 our, vasile wrap protects the perfect wedge tobacco and it's moisture content number four select proofs are worth twice as much in our continuity program and finally NASCAR racing sponsorship among racing enthusiasts now let's go in the store and see how personal selling can make a difference to our business hi I'd like a pack of Virginia Slims, you miss your smoker I sure am my name is Brian Stockdale I work for RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company I'd like to ask you a couple of questions real quick if I could write your name Mary Jones nice to meet you marry my pleasure your birthday January 1st 1963 very good real quick what do you think makes cigarette brands taste different, different tobacco that's absolutely right and what do you think makes a great wine or a good whiskey, different ingredients and aging I guess people take their time I'd like to talk to you about a brand that you're not currently smoking called Winston select slim lights I tried Winston's before I don't like them this is a new Winston select product different from our current Winston products and just like fine wine and whiskey we have perfectly aged product that we take our time with what I'd like you to do is put back your pack of Virginia slim lights and I'll buy you a second pack to go along with it and you'll leave with two packs of the price of one what do you think, sounds great okay if you put her pack back for give her two packs of Select lights a couple other things real quick I'd like to show you all right most products have cellophane we put what's called a flavor seal wrap on our product so once we go through the trouble of using perfectly aged tobacco's and put the flavor seal wrap on it what that does is you can bend the select product almost into a you before it ever snaps in half wow so now I do we perfect wedge the tobacco, for a mellow smooth taste but the flavor seal keeps all the moisture in but you're telling me I can definitely notice and if you will notice a huge difference Mary and I'm sure I'm convinced you'll switch in fact I'm so convinced what I'd like you to do I promise real quick this brochure will walk you through what I just took you through how we perfectly aged it tobacco's how we compare to Fine Wine and whiskey and
