ffbn0006,"and we're back now at 7:30 on a Tuesday Morning Joe garagiola I'm Deborah Norville Bryant continues on vacation in just a few minutes Health secretary Louis Sullivan will be with us to talk about the AIDS conference he just attended in San Francisco you'll recall his speech was drowned out by Boos of delegates and others at the conference and he'll tell us what he tried to say then what the government's role in the fight against AIDS just as going to be the sixth annual International AIDS conference meeting in San Francisco ended Sunday much the same way it began with, test this time to protest moved in from the streets to the convention Auditorium where hundreds of demonstrators displeased with the bush administration's efforts to combat the AIDS virus jeered and whistled and shouted down Health and Human Services secretary dr. Louis Sullivan and Sullivan tried to report on the government's progress against AIDS but the demonstrators didn't hear might have interested them secretary Sullivan's remarks have been described by some as a government Olive Branch mr. secretary good morning and thank you for being with us good morning Denver what was going through, your head as so many people were shouting and jeering at you there in the auditorium well Deborah I knew that there would be protests around my speech but I had gone to San Francisco really to show this administration's concern and our commitment about doing everything we can to improve the situation with AIDS and to show our compassion about this this problem that we have spoken about and the president has spoken about many times and I felt that it was unfair, fortunate that I had not been given the opportunity to bring that message to those attending the conference we certainly have the opportunity now what specifics do you have to offer we spend in our current year for research and education on AIDS more than any other disease more than we spend on cancer although 25 times as many people die from cancer in the United States in 1989, I also had in my speech a statement about the need to protect against discrimination of against those with the virus including those who are food handlers something just the night before leaders of the conference at ask for me to include in my statement because of a bill before the Congress are now so those were the kinds of things that I had in my state statement those are the kinds of things I continue to be committed to and we want to, do everything we can as we have all along been doing to really Advance our treatment about AIDS to really bring this epidemic under control with respect to the anti-discrimination bill will you personally go to Capitol Hill and Lobby against against that particular provision of it I have already sent letters to the leaders of the Congress Debbie pointing out that there is no Public Health reason to discriminate against those infected with the AIDS virus, in the food handler with occupation that's a direct communication that has I've already sent to the Congress I've also spoken directly with the members of the Congress so we've already been involved in that issue if as you say the administration is moving forward and dedicating such a significant portion of money to AIDS research and development for vaccines against the disease why then is there this perception that there's a sit on your hands kind of attitude in Washington, well that is what the AIDS activist act up specifically that's the message that they are trying to get across which is erroneous that is not a correct message the president has spoken out on multiple times and so have I so have other members of my department I indeed enjoy an excellent working relationship with many in the AIDS Community but certainly when the attempt is made, 82 really a bridge My First Amendment rights to be heard to respond to the invitation from the leaders of this conference to come as a representative of our government and participate and then to be not allowed to speak that is a contradiction and that is an American and that I will not tolerate on the other hand there is this provision by the immigration service that would prevent anyone who test HIV positive from entering the United States do you agree with that policy decision that is, is a bill that that is now before the Congress that is a provision that was enacted by the Congress so it is really up to the Congress to address that situation so we certainly are waiting the congressional action on that yeah well you certainly as you said free speech is one of your rights you are certainly entitled to go and say yay or nay how you feel about it to Congress, yes I have made my position very clear on that we have implemented for this conference as well as others even when the legislation was introduced some months ago by Congressman Rowland and and Waxman because I felt that knowing how the Congressional calendar works that it was highly unlikely that the Congress would have finished action on this in time for the conference we worked, in the administration with the president with the justice department with the immigration service to find a way to develop a special 10-day waiver where anyone wanting to come to the conference with not have to respond to any questions concerning Aids HIV infection that was done to ensure that there would be free flow of individuals who wanted to come to the conference to come to the conference as well as to other conferences that would be held here in, the United States but beyond that 10-day period it does remain on the books a doctor Sullivan thank you for being with us we do appreciate your time thank you",0.8068723707692308,0.7300149,0.9075406

fffc0072,"thank you very much for coming here today my name is Victor hanim with Philip Morris USA will be beginning in he's just in a moment with some opening comments will take questions after those are completed we do have a live link up to New York City to our offices in New York and we'll be taking questions from them after the completion of this press conference so when this one is done please allow for a few minutes of break you're welcome to stay if you want to participate, but we'll be starting to take cues and he's from New York afterwards because of that I would hope that everybody would be able to stay clear of the camera so there's a clear view thank you very much, good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for coming to this briefing my name is Marie bring I'm senior vice president and general counsel of Philip Morris companies with me today are Steve Parrish senior vice president and general counsel of Philip Morris USA and to his right herb Wachtel founding and Senior partner of the law firm of Wachtel Lipton Rosen & Katz in New York earlier this morning Philip Morris filed a ten billion dollar lawsuit against the American Broadcasting, testing companies and several ABC employees for false and defamatory statements made on ABC's day one new show and other news programs the suit was filed in Richmond Virginia Circuit Court the essential allegation by ABC on these broadcasts was that cigarettes are artificially spiked with nicotine during the manufacturing process in order to keep people smoking these, as allegations are not true and ABC knows that they are not true the facts are these nicotine occurs naturally in tobacco leaf Philip Morris does not in any way shape or form spike it cigarettes with nicotine there is in fact a net loss of nicotine during the cigarette manufacturing process that net loss for every Philip Morris brand without exception, runs 25% 20 to 25% and the overall nicotine content in cigarettes has declined by more than 50 percent over the past 40 years ABC was aware of these facts prior to the February 28 broadcast ABC chose to ignore these facts, after the false statements were initially broadcast ABC was again informed of the inaccuracies yet the statements were repeated again and again on various ABC broadcasts as a result of the false and defamatory statements broadcast by ABC the price of Philip Morris stock declined dramatically members of Congress called for investigations into cigarette manufacturing processes, commissioner Kessler of the Food and Drug Administration expressed his concern and even President Clinton on a recent ABC broadcast stated and I quote that really bothered me when I heard that more nicotine was going to make to make sure that people were hooked close quote, to help set the record straight this week we met with officials from the Food and Drug Administration who are given a scientific briefing and a tour of our manufacturing facilities we will be offering that same opportunity to members of Congress and general Accounting Office officials, at Philip Morris we are proud of our products and the millions of people who consume them and produce them there is no Corporation in this country more committed to freedom than his Philip Morris as the manufacturer of a controversial product we well understand the importance of all of our freedoms including a free press that speaks for and to the diversity of this country, but we do we must draw the line at libel I would now like to introduce her block tell our counsel in this matter to discuss specifics of the lawsuit after which we will be happy to entertain your questions herb, good morning, I'm herb Wachtel of the law firm of Wachtel Lipton Rosen & Katz representing the Philip Morris plaintiffs in the litigation you've all received a copy of what is called a motion for judgment that was filed this morning in the Virginia State Court Circuit Court in Richmond a motion for judgment under Virginia practice is the equivalent of a complaint in a lot of other jurisdictions, as set forth in the court papers Philip Morris has brought a defamation action against ABC to redress the harm caused by statements made on several ABC programs most notably they February 28 and March 7 Day One programs in which Philip Morris and other tobacco companies were accused of artificially spiking cigarettes by adding extraneous amounts of nicotine, 18 for the express purpose of keeping smokers hooked, the complaint I'll refer to it as a complaint describes in considerable detail how tobacco is processed for use in the final cigarette product it establishes that the allegations in the day one program are false we as a law firm have satisfied ourselves by our investigation that this is a meritorious lawsuit, as the complaint details only infinitesimally Trace Amounts of nicotine end up in the Blended product from any of the processes referred to in the day one programs indeed as set forth the amounts are so small as to not be quantifiable even by standard measuring techniques, moreover as the complaint sets forth substantial amounts of nicotine are actually lost in the manufacturing process and the final cigarette cigarette product contains less nicotine than the original tobacco plant we are confident that this lawsuit will establish that ABC's charge that Philip Morris as extraneous nicotine to hook smokers was clearly false our firm will be working in conjunction, auction with the Huntin and Williams firm of Richmond Virginia I will be pleased to answer questions that will explain the complaint or help in understanding the complaint however as counsel in the litigation I am under certain constraints I will not be going into our proofs and evidence and questions that go to matters other than the complaint itself should more appropriately be addressed to, Marie bring or Steve Parrish,thank you Herb At this point will be glad to entertain questions I would appreciate it ladies and gentlemen if you would first identify yourself and your affiliation yes sir how do you respond to the Commissioners position that there is additional yes well let me tell you how we have, respondent thus far we have invited commissioner Kessler to come down to Richmond to examine our manufacturing facilities and to receive an in-depth briefing on the process itself and the role of nicotine in tobacco and the way in which its manufactured commissioner Kessler had a group of his employees at our facility two days this week they have had an extensive scientific briefing we have given them a complete tour of the, manufacturing facility and have shown them how we process tobacco demonstrating throughout that entire procedure that nicotine is actually removed from the cigarettes and not added to it we believe we had a very good session with commissioner Kessler we are hopeful or rather with his people we are hopeful that as a result of this tour and the understanding that his staff has received from it that they now realize what the facts are, nicotine and whether you fine-tune the cigarette knowing just how much nicotine is necessary to dict the consumer and you keep that nicotine level perfectly set so the smoker will be hooked well let me that's a several parts of that question let me address press as many of them as I can and can we can can recall I think I'd like to get back first of all to what the essential allegation of the ABC broadcast was because that is what this lawsuit is all about Ava, Cece's broadcast if you're familiar with it made it very clear that the allegation they were making is that we Spike our cigarettes with artificially induced an extraneous quantities of nicotine that is absolutely true now on the question that you have the subsequent question that you raised about the levels of nicotine in our products I, absolutely true well I'm sorry, yes well obviously the allegation is unsure where we wouldn't be bringing this lawsuit thank you for correcting me with respect to the question you've raised about the levels of nicotine on our various products we manufacture a broad variety of products that have various nicotine and deliver and tard deliveries there's a broad range that are available to Consumers every one of those products to the advertising for every one of those products discloses the exact, Livery of nicotine and tar in the cigarette these products were developed in response to Consumer preferences nicotine and tar has relate to The Taste and the quality of the product and over the years it's become clear that various smokers prefer various types of nicotine and tar deliveries and so we have endeavored to make products which satisfy all of those consumer preferences there's nothing secret about it it has been disclosed for over 20 years the fact of the matter is, that in each of these instances if you look at the levels of nicotine in our products over the past several years there has been a reduction across the board in all tar and nicotine deliveries and the further fact of the matter is that all of those deliveries are specified on the advertisements and are disclosed to the public so that every smoker who decides to smoke one of our products knows exactly what the tar and nicotine levels are so there's no manipulation, Elation which I think is a somewhat pejorative word we make products to specification and they have to be the same in order to qualify for the deliveries that are disclosed in the advertisements, Esther escape from Scripps Howard news service is there any difference between the way you make cigarettes in the way other tobacco companies make cigarettes well I can't really speak for other companies I can say this there many of the processes that are involved such as the reconstituted tobacco process which was a focal point of the ABC day one program has been something that's been disclosed in the public literature for years the first patent on reconstituted Tobacco process, was issued over 150 years ago the process is described in great detail in a variety of government documents including the surgeon general's reports of 1979 and 1981 I believe it was I believe that's a process that probably every cigarette manufacturing company uses but I cannot speak with any Authority on what the specific processes are that other companies use the industry, free when you make these charges I am speaking for Philip Morris when I make these charges the allegations that were contained in the ABC broadcast some of them specifically referred to Philip Morris others of them referred to the entire industry we are a member of the industry and what I'm saying is that those allegations as they applied to Philip Morris are untrue and malicious, yes sir how did you arrive at the 10 billion dollar figures that just the lost in stock I'm sorry Paul Corson with Associated Press radio how did you arrive at the ten billion dollar figure place the complaint I think sets forth the damage aspects of the case I think it would be important to focus on the fact that Philip Morris is a very large company our domestic tobacco business is certainly one of the core businesses of our company one element of the of the damage that is referred to in the complaint, is that our stock price did go down significantly as a result of the ABC broadcast and the subsequent events leading from that broadcast think you should bear in mind that we have thousands of shareholders that there are over 800 million shares of Philip Morris stock traded we have so therefore if there is one dollar decline in the share price of our stock that's almost a billion dollars in Damages right there the domestic tobacco portion, of our business is a very important Core Business we believe that the ABC allegations and the subsequent events that have happened have the potential and in fact have damaged that business we're talking about large businesses that are very profitable and we think that the damages we have specified or not at all unreasonable the other part of the claim for damages is a punitive damage award which we hope to obtain in the in the amount of five billion dollars, yes ma'am, we've seen no evidence of that, yes decide to file in Richmond is it because there's a better understanding of your product and Industry there well actually we had a choice in a number of places where we could file this suit but Richmond to us seemed like a natural place to do it we are a Virginian Corporation our domestic tobacco business the Philip Morris Incorporated is also a Virginia Corporation it is the headquarters of our manufacturing operations are enrichment so it seems to us to be as logical place to file that lawsuit, as anywhere Esther result of this lawsuit smokers know more about the specific ingredients that go into cigarettes, well, this this lawsuit does not focus on ingredients the fact of the matter is that the ingredient subject which is one that was covered in the second ABC broadcast I should also point out however that that second broadcast repeated the false and malicious comments about nicotine but the subject of ingredients is something that that the government has known a great deal about for many many years there is a statute and it was adopted in 1980, or which requires the cigarette industry to submit a list of all ingredients to the Department of HHS as a matter of fact before that statute became effective the industry voluntarily submitted it lists of ingredients to the government the government has had these list for years we have offered to make our scientists available to them if they have any problems with any of the ingredients that are used in a cigarettes they have never suggested to us that they do we are, firmly of the opinion that all of the ingredients that are used in our products are safe as used in in the cigarettes and so you should also realize that these ingredients are matters of that relate to trade secrets they relate to the formulas which constitute our various products you don't find any manufacturers of consumer products really disclosing all of the ingredients that go into their product because it is very proprietary and it is a trade secret but I, think that the government has been fully aware of these of these ingredients for years and has not raised a problem with us concerning any of them Esther Mike Wallace from CVS as you may know 60 Minutes is doing a report this coming Sunday on fire safe cigarettes and we've been trying to talk to you people at Philip Morris for year year and a half I've been in touch with Victor Han who started this news conference this morning and he'll continue about that, over a thousand Americans die each year in fires that are ignited by cigarettes the question is does Phillip Morris have a project underway now to develop a fire safe cigarette and how far along is that development mr. Wallace we've been working on fire-safe cigarettes for years we have a continuous project in that regard I cannot tell you how far away from completion we are we are working on it however According to some, events that we have gotten from inside your company you have a project Hamlet, which seems from the documents that we have come into possession of which seems to indicate that the Philip Morris company does indeed have a fire safe cigarette tested as long ago as 1987, and it would seem by simple mathematics that in just the last seven years eight years perhaps 8,000 Americans have died because they haven't had access to that fire safe cigarette I'm not familiar with with project Hamlet as you describe it let me say mr. Wallace that I'm aware of the fact that you've been working on this on this program I'm also aware of the fact that attorneys for the industry have met with you or, our staff and have provided a great deal of information concerning it I think we have also advised you that if you will indicate to us any specific questions that you have concerning that we will try to provide answers this this this present right again and I've talked just yesterday once again to Victor Han and he said that Senior Management has said to him Philip Morris will not talk to us about this I believe mr. mr. Wallace that we have, I've said we would not appear on your program without first being advised of what the questions were if you will talk to one of our corporate Affairs people or mr. Han and advise us what your questions are will be try it we will be glad to try to get you answers let me say this conference was called for our suit against ABC and I'd like to get on with that subject if you have any other questions yes sir is because you have been stonewalling us for a year or a year and a half on the subject of fire-safe cigarettes and you've just said something that is inaccurate, I told Mr Hatten hold it just a second this is a this is a news conference I told Mr Han yesterday that I would be happy if they go along if you people go along and give us somebody to talk to from Philip Morris Philip Morris about project Hamlet he said I'll get back to you yesterday he didn't mr. walz I think I've answered your question are there any other questions about our suit against ABC yes sir in Richmond Times Dispatch is your timing in filing the suit today tied in any way to the scheduled test, Moni tomorrow of David Kessler on Capitol Hill some people in the on the hill have suggested that it is a pre-emptive move now the timing of this suit is and the hearing tomorrow are purely coincidental we've been working on this suit since the ABC broadcast aired it has taken us time to get in a position to file the suit as mr. Wachtel indicated he conducted an investigation of his own that took some time it took time to draft the complaint is purely coincidental that is being filed today we did it as, play as we could yes sir Ron Taylor in the months since the initial in the nearly 30 days since the initial broadcast what have you been doing to try to get abc2 to satisfy your your complaints and what's been the response well we before the first broadcast aired we send a statement over to ABC making it very clear that we do not Spy Car cigarettes they chose to ignore that statement when they repeated the, A on their March 7th broadcast at prior to that time we sent a statement another statement to ABC which they chose to ignore and as I say repeated the allegations on March 7th we issued a public statement to all of the media concerning this issue of spiking we have been in touch with government agencies that have been have raised questions about as I said the federal Food and Drug Administration has paid a visit to our facilities we have also, invited the GAO to come down and have a briefing and an inspection tour of our facilities in response to a request that that agency received from Senator Kennedy to look into the matter we've been fully responsive to members of Congress and others who were concerned and who were misled by the allegations that were contained in the ABC program as kind of settlement before the suit reaches fruition some sort of retraction broadcast retraction or something well that's not up to, to me obviously I don't know what ABC's response to this will be we have brought this lawsuit because we feel very seriously about it we think we have been damaged by the allegations which were false we believe we're entitled to a court Award of Damages what the progression of the litigation will be its I can't say I have no idea what ABC's reaction to this will be yes sir report do you believe that there is a linkage between the ABC program of and up, commissioner Kessler looking into the possibility of designating cigarettes as a drug and the the proposed tax increase on cigarettes that the administration is looking for in the Congress is looking at for healthcare I have no idea whether there's any Lincoln's they're not commissioner Kessler's letter to the coalition to which he responded did make a reference to the issue of spiking now whether that was something that he, he had an independent interest in or whether it was prompted by the fact that ABC was going to be running this program I really don't know but we're focusing on what we consider to have been a scurrilous charge by ABC which was clearly false in which they knew to be false yes sir question about the broader climate you're operating in you're talking at a time when Congress is talking about cigarette taxes when Congress, it's also talking about further restrictions on smoking in school when you've had several surgeon general's in a row now who have been unrelenting and their criticism of the industry I'm wondering what is it like working in the tobacco industry these days do you feel loved or, I think your publication did a rather lengthy article on that in the magazine section last week the cigarette industry is an old industry those of us who work in it I think are very proud to be involved I certainly am proud to be an executive of Philip Morris companies I think we're an honorable company I'm very proud of the things that we do in terms of supporting the community and the various activities that occur in our plant facilities and around the world I think we make high quality, be high standard products not only in tobacco but in food and beer as well I realized that cigarettes like many other products is a controversial product I think emotion sometimes run very high I think sometimes unreasonably High we're aware of all of those things but we think we are selling a high-quality product it is a legal product it is legal in every country in the world which very few products can say and I think that we are prepared to address the issues, that confront us from time to time the reason we brought this lawsuit is because we leave that sometimes the hysteria surrounding the issue of tobacco makes people think that we are fair game for anything that people want to say about us even though it is clearly untrue and defamatory we think we have to draw the line at that and that's the reason for this lawsuit of course, nobody likes a lot nobody likes a lot you know and we on in the news media don't like libel suit is it conceivable that this could all have been turned aside have you people been more available on camera with ABC or conceivably on camera with 60 minutes to talk about business I know this has nothing to do with your program mr. Wallace that's a that's a hypothetical question I do not know, but whether we were available for ABC or not as I said before we did provide them with information if we are available are not is really irrelevant I believe that a news organization has an obligation both legal ethical and moral to report the truth if they know that it is not the truth then they have no right to report it and that is the allegation of his complaint yes sir you don't put yourself up whether it be on camera on record of her today, you can't just hand out information as fact well how do you respond then what can the news program due to report if you will not come forward and we try to be responsive as we think is appropriate I should point out mr. Parrish has reminded me that on the ABC broadcast that we're talking about RJ Reynolds did make two of its employees available and were in fact interviewed and on the show and denied the allegations, mr. Paris National Public Radio I understand that distinction between spiking and adjusting the levels of nicotine that you do but what what what real difference does that make if in fact you are if you end up with a product with a set amount of nicotine to how does that really change the argument about whether or not nicotine levels are manipulated well I think you have to draw a distinction between what ABC was alleging in this suit which is spiking, and what you're talking about which is adjusting levels spiking is an allegation that suggests and in fact the ABC made it very clear that this was what they were charging that we add extraneous nicotine to the product in large quantities in order to keep smokers hooked that is almost a Verbatim quote from their story that is an outrageous allegation it is totally untrue and it is the allegation which has been picked up by everyone as a result of that, broadcast including President Clinton it has poisoned The Well it has been believed and embraced by a number of people members of Congress members of the administration members of the press probably even members of public of the public we believe that it is necessary to bring this lawsuit in order to correct the record in order to recover damages for the injury that has been done and to address the issue of spiking now so I want to make it clear that the, ABC program was not talking about simply adjusting levels they were talking about spiking and that was the principal element of the ABC program as I've said before the adjustment of nicotine levels is something that occurs naturally in the process nicotine is taken out at every step of the process nicotine is further removed when the filter is added and through the porosity of the paper and the filtration and the reason that we have to manufacture products, is that have a consistent level of nicotine whatever that level is is because it's required by the Federal Trade Commission in our disclosure to the public as to what the level is if you didn't do that smokers would not know what it is that they are smoking and what levels of nicotine and tar they're obtaining surely they're arguing that nicotine is a is a drug because you are manipulating the levels that whether or not the spiking allegation is true does this really affect, a response that you might have to the FDA that basically you're manipulating nicotine levels yes we have obviously have a position on that we do not think that the FDA has or should assert jurisdiction in this area the fact of the matter is that we are not a food we are not a drug and we are not a cosmetic cigarettes falls into none of those categories and those are the only three categories that the FDA has jurisdiction over so we don't, think there's an appropriate basis for FDA regulation, puts out a nicotine patch if that's a drug for 40 years nicotine is used in cigarettes is not a drug for 40 years well because nicotine in a patch is nothing more than nicotine nicotine in a cigarette is a natural element that is found in the plant itself the for 40 years the FDA the FDA has taken the position that nicotine in used as used in cigarettes is not a drug this is a dramatic departure by commissioner Kessler to even suggest that, that the contrary is the case, you mentioned that that your product is high-quality and illegal product and later you say that this episode is Poison the Well has has a already controversial to use your words product been permanently damaged by by that in this country and in this market I certainly hope not but I think it will just have to wait and see hopefully our consumers will realize once once they know what the facts are and, hopefully the attention that this lawsuit will get will realize that those allegations that were contained in the ABC program are false your industry is taking a lot of hits lately both Regulatory and in sort of custom and practice I mean you can walk down the street outside this office building and see people standing outside Office Buildings who can't smoke inside their their workplaces I'm wondering whether or not what's happened here, has underscored the fragile nature and perhaps even the dying nature of your industry in this market it's hard to say I can't I don't know what the answer to that question is I'm very well aware of the things you refer to I think it's unfortunate that smokers have increasingly become regarded as pariahs in the community there are after all 50 million smokers in the United States we very much support a program of accommodation which will accommodate both the, buyers of smokers to be able to enjoy the product in an environment which is not oppressive and of non-smokers not to be in the presence of smokers if they choose not to yes sir, papers you mentioned before that ABC had accused the industry tobacco industry cigarette makers overall and Philip Morris in particularly now has Philip Morris met with any other cigarette makers about before this lawsuit came about we advise the other companies in the industry were bringing the lawsuit was a class action lawsuit considered, well I don't think this would be an appropriate situation for a class action we're only suing one Corporation and a number of the individuals employees of that Corporation were involved with this program, yes sir as intended they cause health problems or into every health professional I've talked to or even death does that at all bother you or any of the other Executives up there well I've heard the allegations I think some of them are very extreme and inaccurate but obviously as I said before we're making a controversial product I think the the fact of the matter is that there is no Health question in America that has received more, or attention than that relating to smoking and I think that every person in this country as well as throughout the world is aware of those allegations it is a legal product and therefore people I think particularly in a society such as ours have the right to decide whether they want to use that product or not and smokers 50 million of them in this country have decided they want to the so I don't I don't have any problem with with that I think that's that's the way, it should be and I hope it will be the way it will continue to be, smoking and health problems simply it's only an allegation in your eyes is what we have we have indicated that we that the epidemiological studies make it clear that smoking is a risk factor for certain diseases that does not mean that it is a causative Factor what it means is that there is a basis for further research so far we do not believe that the research has indicated definitively one way or the other, yes ma'am yes he said that your stock price to Luis Escobar knight-ridder financial news you said that your stock price declined directly in response to these reports did you think that as a result of filing this lawsuit that they would be a direct impact on your stock price that's not one of the reasons we filed a lawsuit I have no no way of knowing how the market will respond but the fact of the matter is one of the ABC broadcast that we refer to in the complaint involved a statement by, the reporter they're drawing the connection between their program and the drop in our stock price yes sir King broadcasting along those lines you said you base your 10 billion dollar figure on somewhat on the stock price decline yet at the same time within the last month or been a number of other hits against the tobacco industry the Pentagon Banning smoking some other things we could mention so how can you directly attribute the day one program for the stock price decline well I think you just, have to look at what happened the day after that program and the comments of ABC themselves to indicate that that that particular drop in stock price was related to the program we do have as I mentioned as was indicated before a excuse me we do have a hook up with New York that we have to get to I'll be glad to take two more questions, why did you end the use of, flavor packages you mentioned that in your in your motion we haven't we haven't ended the use of flavor packages we we ended in 1993 the use of a particular flavor package in one of our Brands and that was part of an ongoing process that we have been engaged in for several years to reduce the number of flavorings and ingredients that go into our products consumer product safety Commission, believes that cigarettes should indeed be regulated 400,000 Americans die each year according to the federal government because of cigarettes the only to unregulated products that I know of perhaps you can enforce our guns and cigarettes why should cigarettes not be regulated I think it's inaccurate mr. Wallace to say that cigarettes are not regulated there is extensive regulation of our product first of all by Congress itself which, in an unprecedented fashion has taken it upon itself to write the specific warnings which must appear on all of our packages and advertising we are regulated by the Bureau of alcohol and tobacco tobacco and firearms we are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission I think that it would be it is inaccurate to say that there is no regulation applying to the product we manufacture ma'am you had a question Science magazine does your company or any other tobacco company have any research project, send away to look at alternative uses for tobacco, I'm going to ask mr. Parish to answer that, we've received that question from time to time and we have always answered that we do not comment on what we're doing in our research Department that's a no comment, as has been reported the shorts cigarette for those who need their fix in a hurry, we're not going to come in at this press conference on on any of our marketing strategies either report an accurate is the report an accurate determination which report you want to Newsweek magazine suggesting that you're coming out with a cigarette I'm not going to comment on our marketing strategies sure one more question probably the general counsel have you been invited by Congressman Waxman tomorrow to testify and are you going to and if not why not given your feelings on drug the the nature of nicotine, we were invited by Congressman Waxman to appear before his subcommittee tomorrow our company as Philip Morris will not be attending the hearing to testify but representatives of the industry will be testifying and as mr. bring pointed out we have met over extensive meetings in two days with I believe it was ten members of commissioner Kessler staff of FDA and as I understand it commissioner Kessler will be testifying, oh thank you thank you very much for coming I'd like to make one other announcement we have a an eight-minute film that we have prepared which will describe to you the manufacturing process of cigarettes as it occurs in our facilities if any of you is interested in seeing that it will be available to be shown in an adjacent room we also have in your press kits a written document which describes that process it's very, similar to the film but if you want to actually see it at how it works you can take a look at that film you have the printed script is it yeah it will be available yeah, number of magazines are you advertising do you think that you'll be pulling your advertising from that or if you consider that as an option well and as a matter of fact cap cities which owns ABC also runs a lot of advertising from our food and beer companies but that is not something we're considering at this time one last question Fred Todd with the Raleigh News & Observer recently you had 16,000 tobacco workers came to Washington to protests now you file a libel suit does this Mark a, current tone of the strategy of the tobacco industry from a few years back when tobacco Congressional delegations were widely thought to have acceded to a compromise say on the airline smoking ban does this is a strategy changed but I wouldn't describe it as part of a mass strategy I think as has been reported here before there are a number of things that are occurring in our industry we think we try to develop what we consider to be the appropriate response to every one of them on the federal excise tax we thought it was very important for the administration and Congress to realize how many, jobs would be lost if that tax went through and how many families in this country would be affected our employees decided that they would like to demonstrate that in a collective way and that is what led to to this march with respect to this lawsuit I think I've already indicated to you why we're doing that we look at each one of these individually and will fashion whatever response we think is appropriate thank you very much for coming, Jeff, hey hello this is Evelyn Merlot we have you on video right now and we can hear you okay can you hear us Ellen yes first questions coming up right now I'm Lee first from Prudential Securities and my question has two parts first of all if you win any damages what portion of it might be taxable and secondly what would you do with the money, any how much do we get if I didn't hear the second and third parts of the question, speak right into the mic the second part is if anything is what we do with the protein, I'm very sorry about the sound system here is not quite good I cant I cant hear the questioner can you hear me Marie yes if you speak up at that level I can illin okay the question was if we win this lawsuit what will we do with the proceeds hopefully it will some of it will go to pay our legal fees although we would hope to get a separate award for legal fees from the court, as well I haven't really given much thought to that it'll be obviously income in the year we receive it and it will do with it what we do with the rest of our income on the question of whether the damages are taxable I don't really know what the answer to that is we'll have to consult our tax people on that, second question coming up I'm sorry but that was broken up I didn't hear any of the question, okay baby come up here and ask the question because it seems that this is the only mic that's working, there, hello my name is Maria Musso with Dow Jones news service you said that you believe the allegations by ABC has damaged your tobacco domestic backhoe business and then later said that you had no evidence of an impact on sale can you be specific and how its damage to business yes well the complaint addresses that actually and it points out that as a result of these allegations there are a variety of things that have happened already and it could get worse such as a possible impact on congress's thinking on, an FDA regulation we've already seen indications of that from Congressman Waxman and Senator Kennedy and others also the possible impact that these allegations might have and the way Congress views the issue of the federal excise tax so there are there are a number of legislative and governmental activities that could impact very adversely on our business all of which are set forth in the complaint, it indicated ABC that their information was wrong would you be very very specific about what efforts you made to give them your side of it and what specifically you told them that they didn't use we sent them a statement prior to the Airing of this program in which we categorically denied and made it clear to them that we do not add extraneous amounts of nicotine to our product they ignored that data that I believe it was, on the morning of the 28th is that correct there may have been two different there may have been two different statements all right mr. Han is correcting me the first statement to ABC was on the 25th of February the second one was on the 20 the morning of the 28th, thank you",0.8390490833333335,0.6778732,0.9128388

ffhb0039,"even more rare, what we'll do is just start in this is so I can figure out who you guys are going to get home if you could just start by stating your name my name is Theresa I live here in Safety Harbor what what brand of, music once tonight 100's order a light one hundredths okay how long have you been smoking like what's a Winston and that combination that combination probably 15 years more 15 years ago it's always Winston yeah well I started off and I was a kid at foot Carrington's the different ones but when since I've sucked okay we're about to dance my name is Deanna from st. Pete I smoked camel like 100's, I've been smoking them now for about 1215 years he ever switch around between Brands just camel regulars the light and in between us thinking basically camel okay how did you all did you guys come in and go to a group with a lot of other people if both of you haven't okay and then if you remember back then they were talking about what it's like to be a smoker today and kind of how people's attitudes have changed towards smokers, have you personally either one of you notice that practically okay like go ahead and I mean what what is it like to be a smoker and safety today and how has it changed recently not so much in STP but I travel their planes in the days when you could smoke you had to sit in the back of the plane but even now an airport you got to physically leave the airport in order to have a cigarette and you got to go back to security and all the hassles of trying to run for planes and it's true, aggravating and then you got the smoking cars non-smoking cars converted a few what about you Teresa mean what's it like might notice right now you can't smoke them all if you want to smoke we have to let it go outside and if you do smoke anywhere by just looks at you like you have dirt on your face or something you know it's just a bad person has spoken what is just as the reacting to what do you think how secondhand smoke probably, such a big deal with that right now all right that mainly here's the main thing I say also they don't like the owner or the the smoke and paper plane to make its knees or irritates her nose or what have you and they don't like the smell on their clothes I'm curious in either either one of y'all can go go on this one when you first before you got to try this cigarette before you get to the first try of a cliff so you start hearing about it and you were sitting, a group and then what kind of thoughts are going through your mind what we what were you thinking truth yeah I thought was a good idea it's you know smoke for me I'm free I thought I was pretty good idea did you have any did you anticipate anything as far as like what it would taste like or before I try to change my voice right now I just feel you're just interested yeah yeah I just thought the concept was really nice yeah what about you Dan what were you, thinking yeah I think the concepts excellent that it's basically trying to help out the defenseless smokers this point I think like basically turning us into closet smokers from you guys get the comments they don't mind you smoking just don't exhale but I thought it was very unique and a new wave of where the smokers going to go I was concerned about the flavor and it tastes because primarily that's what I like about it, camels I do find a difference between camels Winston's and lights and Ultras and those kind of things that have tried in the past but that was pretty important also what did you think did you have a nice digit guess like what it would taste like no no I I tried both the Menthol and then I'm involved just to try both of them during a class I used to smoke cools years ago the irritated my throat for me back to the non menthols okay, what it all just keep going with you Dan what was it like them that first time I think you got to try them in those groups as what did you think of the startup was tough basically they told us to who's like a cigar and the women fared because they don't know how to smoke too many cigars but you got to really draw a hard to get it going and to me it seemed like I had to draw a hard to keep it going the flavor was different what I kind of turned it back, back to was like like when the Fantage first came out it had a like a twang to it and a little bit of a bite that's probably the only thing that really would be negative on my side would be the flavor leaves a little bit after by kind of like maybe smoking a cigar, okay what about you Teresa what was your I mean when you were in there and you try to hustle well it was awfully hard to life as hard to smoke and a sex machine learning to smoke all over again it was real hard to smoke what did you think about the taste when you finally face them well I normally smells like cigarettes and the light when I try there's no flavor at all because I didn't think that was so I went I could try the full flavor that's a little better, not much not much now now I'm not I like the whole idea but I really do and I hope they can improve on it somehow but it's too hard to smoke you smoke at you just like I'm on a cigarette now I want a real cigarette I feel like I'm playing so in your case is not really satisfying you knocked around by 10 degree I smoked them with my camels and you know I'll tell you the alternating back and forth, It's like playing yeah it's like okay now I want to my break now I want a real cigarette yeah what now how much you have to pack Cinema think as a first step right and then a carton or did you just take the cart just the car okay so both of you have smoked the car you didn't know okay when you smoke the car what did you notice anything, front like the people noticed that the state was a different kind of cigarette to show it to anybody I had a lot of comments everybody that was near me when I was smoking had a comment it was very much A Conversation Piece a couple folks had to try it never quite finished it the biggest thing with secretaries day was that week and we had non smoker smoking them the girls that don't smoke we went out to us with lunch and we went for when I go to a smoking table for them and we got this, smoking table and I'm passing these out knowing people that place and I kind of thought maybe what are they smoking in passing around over there because we were all talking and really going on about the cigarettes and really became a attraction of like eight people in the corner of Steak and Ale so it they they didn't they commented like the same thing it's too hard to draw part about a few comments that got everybody's attention about how hard they had to draw it anyway, particular means it was arranged was there anyone that just liked it and tried it there any I don't think so they are the smokers preferred they were there all Winston regulars and Winston selects they smoke the regular not the lights and the girls they don't smoke at all they were ever kind of they weren't gagging and nothing but they never like this is different they all thought it was unique that we lay it in the ashtray and there wouldn't be any smoke or thing, they never got smaller as like you know when you're done, how do you how would you answer something like that someone asked you how do you do basically I said there's no more smoke left I had several of tried to relight it and nothing came out and you're done okay let me just, you were talking about when you know they're done you were talking about we need when you know it was done or when you go to these let's say I'm near your friend I come up the I said well they last as long as a normal cigarette, so pretty much I put the three to five minutes is basically what I saw and what they told us it would last and that's about what it lasted I didn't really try the thing they said you could lay it down for two or three minutes of pick it back up generally I don't claim the cigarettes down even even normals I generally hold on to him and I go out more often than that but I found the last 45 minutes okay what about you Teresa did you get an opportunity to show these to anybody I can't get away, mostly girls that work it in like them because they're going to go he had one what do you how do you I mean what would you say to them when they were they see it first or would you say hey look at this new cigarette well they knew I was coming here to start with for the survey and so they wanted to try it and, what they thought of a genuine are really interested in like how do you how did you start the conversation and say hey guess what yeah well I thought I went to a survey and they understood the cigarette smoke free no ashes you know to try and what were their reactions they were always the same no one really yeah nobody okay and what was the biggest was it taste yeah because you have to draw too hard on, you really I mean Vivid light in it they can get anything at all and I'm your smoke on it have to be lighted and play with the quite a bit to get it to light up the women that had to try to have more problems with the taste and then was worried about him going out some of them first thought that was a cigarette load in the end it's going to blow up it's a gag cigarette never like don't like you said I'm smoking one you're waiting in their way it's pretty good, is this something that can address me earlier today when we were talking with it that a lot of non are we're getting a lot of pressure smokers are getting a lot of pressure from the fact that there's a secondhand smoke and this is a great is able to produce secondhand smoke a lot is it you know where does it come fit into the picture of what's going on out there today you know like we're talking about earlier as a cigarette that does reduce, it's move significantly where where does this fit in I think in restaurants main issue with areas that are basically going smoke-free totally the smokers are taking their business they're they're going elsewhere I think they would try to track that business back I know for a fact the airport's that's lounges in the bars where they used to crowd everybody to smoke that they would make you you couldn't stand in Smoke you had that have a cold, good beer or something they're spending money now these lounges rmp when I walk through them now they're really being hurt their business is down 40 to 60% from the bartender's I've talked to and they're kind of lobbying to get smoking back because the tip money, you think this plate would play a role in this I think that would isolate that area again where we used to be with the crowded smoke-filled rooms it would be reduced down because that seemed to be the biggest complaint that was the smoke-filled rooms they would still allow us to sit there and smoke, what about you Teresa do you see this the cigarette nice if I would I don't think it will I don't think anybody's gonna it's not a smoking now I don't think I'll ever go back and say okay you can smoke if you smoke this new cigarette I don't see that ever happening what about I mean you guys are it sounds like most people that you showed it to really didn't like it that much, I'm curious in the group that you were in when you came in here and talk to that what was the reaction of the group do you remember next what do you think the cigarette is for who do you think would like to cigarette in you can you think of anyone people smoke in their own homes they're going to like it if you have kids maybe smoke in the house they'll like it or if you put smoke in the car because they don't want the odor in the car, okay is this a cigarette that if you were going to watch it let's say you're watching this video and you're working back when Winston Salem on this this cigarette getting two clips ready do you Market this cigarette the cigarette that should be out on the market because it produces secondhand smoke by sunlight and has some benefits to it just check it out we have to improve it a little first make it easier to like make it, it easier lines of you know so teachers Funk means the flavor I think it's very well Market, do you think it's marketable right now if we put it on the market tomorrow t think so probably not the same initially go because of the concept and the uniqueness, but primarily I smoke for the flavor, that's enough so much the drawing on it or the toughness but the flavor of feeling that satisfy my craving okay Teresa you said that you had showed it to some people I guess at work right did you show it to anybody else or did I'm curious did anyone stop either one of you two and actually notice it without you bringing it up if they didn't tell me about that how did that happen and what was what went on like what kind of, and when I do this fellas a nonsmoker and his wife smokes and he's basically kind of rides her all the time and he rides the used to be our plant manager and I was sitting directly beside him and he was noticing that I wasn't burying him to smoke because he generally tries to scoot away from you please smoke while I started telling him about it and he picks it up and thought it looked kind of kind of neat course I told her put down in the napkins the look at money burning anything he thought it was, pretty neat idea, but his thoughts ours no smoking at all he's quit 30 years ago or whatever and he's preaching to his wife quit, I did find that during that time period of that week I smoke probably 30 to 40% more than I normally would have because I had the interim of my camels in between which is back to that satisfaction, okay so I'm curious let's say out of the cities around on the market today would you buy in an average week how much do you how many cigarettes how many packs do you smoke a day one pack two bags are about two pounds to back okay added so that means seven days it's about 14 packs out of this 14 packs would you smoke any eclipse the pack of eclipses are none During the period of the 10 packs of the clips I smoke probably five to, six packs of camels along with which is a little bit more than what I generally spoke to some it varies from time to time because we're smoked us if were depending on if I'm outside of our plan or not I smoke more or I smoked half apples which increases the Pack level today of a smoking area at your work I mean like a slight a designated smoking area yes did you smoke any of these eclipses in there what were people saying I mean people, you're stunning they want to try them so maybe I didn't smoke as many of the of the full pardon I did probably passed out during that interval maybe up to two packs during that time frame when you gave the cigarettes to people what would you say to them just try I want you to explain like the fact that there's sometimes I would tell them because they would see the white pack or the no name on it like what are these and they start asking questions and some I would answer in some other life find out just asked what they thought of them, I'll do my own little survey and and so that's what you were talking about earlier we're not not in I guess no one liked the flavor they didn't care for the drawing part is about it but other than that the thing is they like the uniqueness the single ones thought they were vague great conversation pieces of bringing up conversation, and of course others that have a spouse at home that doesn't like that the smoke about it was great so you can actually taste and hard to draw see ya, what should the government's attitude be toward Reynolds in this cigarette should because right now the government's pretty clear on how they stand on smoking I mean you can't smoke at any public buildings are chords like you had mentioned the military can't smoke in the military anymore what should the government's position Beyond cigarette like this should be any different than any other cigarette like they were probably going to bunch of testing, the biggest factor is the the glycerin difference in the tar nicotine there are pushing for my house standpoint on the individual as well as the second hand smoke and driving it with the second hand smoke people, okay what do you what do you think I mean what is it what should what position should be government on this there are any different than any other cigarette now they should research it I think make sure it's okay but I do think we should be like to smoke somewhere aggressive what say you and I can't see them saying you can smoke these clips in this little area but you can't smoke your Winston's I don't think that's right at all and I don't think they'll do that, um, okay that's it most guys do you have any questions mark thank you all I hope that",0.8158781546000001,0.67858547,0.9128387
ffnm0006,"Amanda a strong mandate not only to enhance its advertising with the bandits Unison consumption we're talking about a product that is lawful and given that I think the administration is looking Bleak but we would much prefer to come down on the side the free and open society and Trust the American people to make the correct decision I think dr. Cooper, does a tremendous service to that end by pointing out the serious health risks that are involved in that decision, sounds to me like you're saying another state of the overwhelming public interest and trying to minimize the cost to Society for cigarette smoking administration's worried about the resume is going from newspapers magazines and billboards and for that reason as well as the fact that you don't think your Surgeon General has made the case because the public interest it would be sir you're not supporting the social search not asking for your response, but I think this is the conclusion that I have to reach here is the reason given for the regulations position my sorry to see that this is the position you will show a she's taking and I hope as we consider this issue of the administration will also reconsider but look at this matter further the administration is concerned the Congress of this this member is concerned about fruits which is why, a half-dozen Witnesses and told us that cigarette smoking is a cause and 350 thousand deaths every year in this country I take it you agree with him, do you recall a memorandum on this subject to you and eight other person received from Elizabeth am wailing of the American Council on science and health, I don't know what time around again referred to so I have many bits of correspondence with Elizabeth way this one in particular and I ask unanimous consent to have this certain record Let me refresh your memory this was addressed to dr. Joanne the Waldo and dr. James, McKenna mr. Mack Mayer John bands off dr. James Wan Li this is done they happen dr. Robin Hood for yourself and dr. Allan Bloom it was dated March 8th 1985 does that help refresh your memory no sir unbelievable amount of Correspondence it has to do with the background I couldn't possibly, member at all I now leave from this memorandum maybe this will help quote I think and then floating Elizabeth well I think it is essential that the public health commit Community Reach some type of consensus on this issue referring to the proper number of deaths due to smoking, pull the for the tobacco Institute or r.j. Reynolds takes the opportunity to use discrepancies in our estimates as proof that all estimates of excess mortality due to smoking on their fabrication on pull did you and these other people reach a consensus and was it 350,000 I have never had discussions with any people that you read on that thing about any subject to do with it, consensus of the numbers of people who die each year from tobacco isn't it a fact that the poop that this death big it is completely conjectural no sir it is not, I'll let me leave to you this day, and ask you whether you're familiar with the total number of deaths caused Ali related to cigarette smoking in the u.s. population cannot be accurately estimated do you know who said that our consumers you're reading something from dr. William Tell the statement was made by the Surgeon General advisory committee on smoking and health 1964 well sir are a lot of things have happened since 1964, well was the the in the subsequent Surgeon General reports that this this was this study they came up for us it was a study that break the 350,000 that's done in-house or was it contracted out how did it happen to figure how was it the garage and most of our statistics on these subjects are coming from the national Center for Health statistics which I think is recognized worldwide as being one of the, the best statistical bodies in the world and the one which has exceptional accuracy for this sort of work you don't have a hat what methodology they use how they got to this point I don't know all the details sir but they do it through every conceivable way that one can do this by the study of death certificates by surveillance in States and local jurisdictions as well as by national surveys and as long as have considerable experience with death, because I know that they are not very accurate too, because I have delivered that certificates be signed by physicians many times and I've had it I can say I don't know what this place is I do it and you put down the cardiovascular and so I don't think that you can rely totally on that but I will send you a copy of dr. Wayman memo and perhaps, once you've read the question perhaps you will be able to dance them for me for the rent dr. Koop 1986 with the Indianapolis Star Health and Human Services secretary oldest bullying said the link has not been fully established that cigarette advertising encourages people especially adolescents to smoke, are you aware of any studies that doctor going for half a dozen know about no I'm not aware of any so I don't know what dr. Bowen knows about studies on the subject I have never heard dr. bones say that and I do know that he supports early the work of the Surgeon General in the same place will contain thing I'm not I don't do that but what I'm saying, the Mater 1986 edition of the Indianapolis Star and interview he says that the link has not been fully established that cigarette advertising encourages people especially adolescents the smoke, thank you mr. chairman I have never been an administrator position on this and I have faded many times before body such as this and I'm a health officer terribly concerned about the, the number of premature deaths in this country and anything that can possibly lessen that disability disease and death under paper based upon the data that you've reviewed your convinced that the manufacturer ties and commotion and attacked the serious problem are you believe that sir, I'm a butcher let me ask you a question you suggested in your testimony that the product may be an aberration or idiosyncratic the fact you said the court went to Great Lengths to make the opinion but let me make the argument that the court went to Great Lengths to make you think you can system for our page 16 and you can you are you doing a slip opinion or, MasterCard ban advertising we consider them and they go on and they say it is precisely because the government could have enacted a whole sale prohibition if the underlying comiket it is permissible for the government to take the less intrusive step of allowing the conduct but reducing the demand through restrictions on advertising and then they further gold legislative regulation of products or activities D and harmful such as cigarettes alcohol, beverages prostitutions have vary from outright prohibition on one hand to legalization of the product or activities with restrictions on the stimulation of cement on the other hand to rule out the ladder intermediate kind of response will require more than we find in the First Amendment now your statement that this is a mirror leave our own opinion it's really more appropriately it's a closer taeyun 524 but there's no narrowness to it is it now I disagree times, with respect to your first point on the citations carrying Bigelow as you know carried out with the advertising contraceptive devices and Bigelow dealt with access to abortion I think those cases that are clearly distinguishable on the basis of the Supreme Court's rationale protecting access to those to those matters you will note that throughout the opinion then Mark Bates, Virginia Board of Pharmacy on outside and so the court rather curiously does not deal with the with the cases that would be most of them for the second thing I would say about the recital that Justice rehnquist additional argument that estate or Puerto Rico for that matter could ban this activity altogether I think has to be considered at least in part that they were reviewing not the actions of the federal government, but the actions of the Commonwealth or the actions of state if you will and you'll note that all the citations that justice rehnquist has at that point in the opinion except for the television ban on Advertising our state citation and this simply goes back I think to the point that we're concerned about as I mentioned in my testimony that the states do have the primary role in our constitutional structure under their Polly I left you there to protect us Federal bailout, advertising for the backup, one has to study the right way to go on let me see if I got this correct you said reason number two why the administration was not supporting my built-in fan of commotion advertising was because it would limit the variety of reading that is available in this country are you trying to tell me this Administration is willing to waste 350,000 American lives of years of the American Republic a lie and reading, is concerned that the empirical debate has not yet been concluded as to whether or not there is a relationship between advertising and the very serious health problem that you're concerned about right we so we cannot say if there's a bale of tobacco advertising some of these Publications and the ideas they disseminate, this is here and those that did not would have to change their higher subscription prices of dementia content of both is that not your testimony, this constant drumbeat of appeals of very seductive appeals to kids under 13 years old two teenagers of these advertisers represent at a cost of the somewhat less than as my sign is a wiping out the other than 50,000 are some like a year one course that suggestion self is lowering the fourth class mail anyway if you want to help the magazine, Sheen and newspapers whoever they are whatever segments of the industry or effective lower the mailing right somewhat that would be targeting and a very directly to them wouldn't that be better Alternatives and then imposing a 65 billion dollar course on American society which is the direct product of that advertising, how can I get some just simply a disagreement, capability does not dispute those findings and the bill we are simply not convinced at this point that the empirical case has been made that the anime advertising will result in the saving of those lat look this is not a simplistic and it's not a simplistic situation and we are not operating in a test tube in a perfect laboratory situation I would hope that any bad, a non-advertising with a compass would be accompanied by some kind of tobacco education program or more likely a self-esteem education program the difficulty we have is that we have had is Congressman the sign on it so it's some experience with a limited game and some of the studies that I have seen suggests that as a result of the limited van and radio and television day because any consumption actually increase well I love with established I didn't will cause the effects of that increase then you, for the Dietrich for a degrees I mean a linear cause and effect relationships are very difficult to establish Cafe and real-life situations could I ask you as a matter of judgment taking a look at those guys don't you think those ads according to any commonsensical approach are designed to appeal to kids would you say they're designed to appeal to corporate Executives for mature people this is thank you, until the kids doesn't every sensor you cry out to those ads showing all these attractive Macho effective sexually appealing young people doing all kinds of things that are played with attractive desirable physical activity physical attractiveness there beside you feel to just the roof the cigarette industry currently desperately needs to keep renewing itself to keep renewing this 350,000 people a million, as two people who fall off the rose over me doesn't your common sense that well my Common Sense tells me that in it but it also tells me that every advertisement for everything for snack foods to automobiles is pitched in exactly the same way you're quite right absolutely right but but automobiles are not lethal automobiles used properly convey people from Square A2 Square be cigarettes are used as this supposed to be used cause death and destruction, action and anguish and and human tragedy isn't that enough for us to say these are aimed at a very vulnerable portion of the marketplace kids and early teens who are sophisticated the white world world world who don't have any sophisticated defenses up there against me extraordinarily sophisticated advertisements being beamed, wouldn't make sense, to spare these kids that feminization of appeals to their vanity that my children's hope for success and hopefully sexual attractiveness as they go from puberty and Adolescence wouldn't be good for society to save them the coordinates such as of this this obsessive a habit which later on most of them were will regret they ever exactly and not sin 60, 50 billion dollars a year to to avoid this but whatever, tell my children that the images that they're saying or simply falls into that certainly the best way for the government to spend money to educate people about the dangers of cigarette smoking dr. Koop how much money is federal government spend discourage people from smoking not nearly enough sir but the the budget for the office of smoking and health there's approximately 3 million but there is love, of other money to spend some of the work that's done Behavior at the Nationals of mental health some of the work from Atlanta to the drug abuse some stuff going on nicotine addiction would probably increase that by three people so festive and we're talking about an industry that assaults",0.795527341521739,0.6629389,0.905757
ffvj0015,"hello I'm Colleen Herndon and I work in the corporate Affairs department at Philip Morris USA starting on Monday July 17 p.m. USA will begin a nationwide TV ad campaign to let the public know about the changes in the way to backhoe is marketed in the US I'm here today with Ellen Marlow RC Senior Vice-President for corporate Affairs to not only preview the new ads but to also give you some new insight into how and why the ads were developed Ellen thank you for joining us today my pleasure Ellen, before we began could you start by telling us a little bit about why we decided to run these ads we decided to run these ads to really educate and inform the public about the profound changes that have occurred in the way tobacco is marketed in this country as a result of Philip Morris and the other major tobacco companies signing the master settlement agreement back in 1998 as you probably know the MSA is really not, top of mind with most people in society today and those who are aware of the agreement tend to think of it only in terms of the dollars that were paid by the companies so we really want to let people know that there have been changes that go Way Beyond the money in the way our products are marketed the fact that there are no longer tobacco billboard, words that we no longer distribute branded incentive items that cartoon characters are no longer used by any of the companies we really want people to know how dramatically the MSA has changed the way tobacco is marketed in this this country and that's really the reason for the ads as you stated earlier we do have, have two ads that will start running on July 17th and I think before we talk any more about what motivated the ads Etc why don't we preview them for the employee so that they can take a look at them we have two different ads to show you and both have similar messages the first is titled date and the second is facts each one lasts for a minute, November 23rd 1998 to settle state law suits America's major tobacco companies signed it Tobacco settlement agreement that provides the states over 200 billion dollars and restricts the marketing of tobacco products the agreement bans all Tobacco Company Billboards in transit advertising no more tobacco logos on clothing or merchandise nope a tobacco product placement in movies and no more cartoon characters, selling cigarettes the agreement strictly prohibits the marketing of tobacco to kids it restricts tobacco brand sponsorship of team sports and entertainment events and it provides 1.5 billion dollars to fund youth anti-smoking ads in education but don't take our word for it for more information call for a copy of the tobacco settlement agreement because things are changing and it Philip Morris we wanted you to know, no matter what you think of America's tobacco companies the fact is at Philip Morris were changing the way we do business to settle state law suits we signed it Tobacco settlement agreement in 1998 that provides the states over 200 billion dollars and restricts the marketing of tobacco products the agreement bans all Tobacco Company Billboards and Transit advertising no more tobacco logos on clothing or merchandise and no more cartoon characters selling, cigarettes the agreement strictly prohibits marketing tobacco products to kids and provides 1.5 billion dollars to fund youth anti-smoking ads in education we know some may question our commitment so the agreement gives your State Attorney General independent enforcement authority to ensure compliance but don't take our word for it call for a copy of the tobacco settlement agreement because things are changing and it Philip Morris we wanted you to know, no, Alan why did we choose television advertising to communicate this message well Colleen is you know we are running some print ads ads that we call our franchise ads that we actually previewed for some of the employees when we started running them earlier this year but on this message we decided to go to television because it does have the broadest reach and we really want to effectively communicate all the things that are happening, how the marketing of tobacco in this country has changed and we think to reach a really broad audience and to have impact on that audience and communicating or message television is probably the best best vehicle we can use these new ads clearly have a very different look and feel to them what was the reasoning behind this different look well as you know we are running the p.m. 21 ads which are very image-based and very much, about the company and all of its philanthropic activities and how the people of Philip Morris are working to make a difference and I think those are very important from an image standpoint but when it comes to communicating about the MSA and some of the changes that have occurred in the way tobacco is marketed people want a straightforward message they really just want the facts they don't want them embellish they want to know what we're doing and what impact it's having, so we decided that this message really should be only fact-based no image but I think the kind of the change message does come through and I think there are good great Synergy with what we're doing with p.m. 21 Ellen why do you think it's so important to communicate this message to the general public well Colleen because I think there's a lot of skepticism out there about tobacco companies and what, we really do and don't do I'm very proud of the way Philip Morris conducts its business I believe we are very responsible company and I think all of us are working together to support to support our mission of being responsible but I'm not sure that the general public really understands that or appreciate all the things that have happened that have really changed, the landscape of tobacco in this country and I think it's important to communicate it because what we do know is that when people really do understand how impactful these changes have been they really think differently about the industry and they really think very differently about our company and I think as you saw from the commercials our tag line we say things are changing and if Philip Morris, USA we wanted you to know these ads say that tobacco companies are prohibited from marketing to kids now it's my understanding that Philip Morris has never marketed to kids why did we include that message in the ads well because unfortunately sometimes perception is reality and while Philip Morris USA has never marketed its products to kids the general public doesn't believe that, at and therefore we felt it was very important to clearly and effectively communicate what the MSA is all about and let the public know that we are forbidden from marketing to kids and then recently we decided to suspend advertising and certain Publications as well as take out all advertising on the back covers of Publications why do we decide to do this was the, part of the tobacco settlement agreement I believe our decision to take our ads off the back covers of all magazines and to suspend advertising in about 48 magazines has more to do with our support of our mission and our values as you know Colleen our mission is to be the most affected respected and responsible developer manufacturer and marketer, of products for adult consumers you know we're very committed to upholding that mission and to supporting it and we run the business in a way that is very consistent with that commitment and I believe that that decision on Advertising is really supportive of the mission I think you could say that the decision on Advertising is very much consistent with the spirit of the MSA but, it was a voluntary move on p.m. USA's part Allen as employees what can we do to help with this effort well you know the people that work for Philip Morris are the best ambassadors that this company has and I think what they can do most to help is to clearly understand the issues and talk about them when they have the opportunity with their friends with groups that they belong to to clearly communicate what the, people of Philip Morris are all about and you know today what we're doing today is in part to preview the ads for the employees but more importantly what we want to do is make sure that all of our employees understand what we're doing and why were doing it so they can be well informed I would ask employees to read in the loop I would ask all of the p.m. USA employees to attend Mike semantic state of, business update when he talks about important issues I would ask all employees to visit our website so that they can read about our positions on important issues so that they are able to talk about them with some Authority and I'm also happy to let the employees know that we'll be launching a p.m. USA wide intranet site where we'll really be able to give them information, shannan news on what's happening in very real time also chats like this one are things that we have planned for the employees on an ongoing basis not just with me but also with other members of the senior team when there are issues that we want to give the employees more insight into Ellen is there anything else you would like to say to us today well first I have to start by saying how proud I am, to be a member of the Philip Morris USA Workforce you know I love the people here I love working with them and I'm proud to be associated with this company and with its people you know we've gone through a lot of change in the last couple of years and the employees have just been fantastic they've been positive they've been optimistic they've been committed they've just been inspiring, to be around so I guess the only thing I have to say is you know well done and more of the same Ellen thank you for speaking with us today thank you Colleen again these ads will be running Nationwide this Monday July 17th and will continue to run throughout the summer thank you for joining us",0.8714045407692306,0.755289,0.9128388

Kugel and welcome on the phone Mike from The Grange Park your question please I'm your hello hi go ahead how much secondhand smoke must you inhale to be equivalent to one cigarette we go well that would be a difficult to answer on a straightforward quantitative basis clearly smoking one cigarette, L physics is contributes a great is much more hazardous than inhaling the smoke from 20 or 30 cigarettes that have been smoked in your presence by someone else does it matter how close you are with the room ventilation is like well it obviously matters how close you are to the source of the smoke because it's going to be diluted at a distance but that doesn't mean that if it's at a distance it's safe whatever it is it's undesirable and the less you can you're forced to, a little better you are but you can't tell us 20 cigarettes equals wouldn't miss Brennan the at Harvard they did a study back in the late 1970s and what they found what their data showed was that you would have to spend 100 consecutive hours in the smokiest bar in Chicago or anywhere near here in anywhere in the world to get the nicotine equivalent of one filtered cigarette that de study was based upon measurements of blood carboxyhemoglobin or carbon monoxide effects from, let's smoke and that's by no means the only hazardous compound in cigarettes that is by no means conform with the health hazards that have been reported in numerous studies particularly with reference to the cancer risk associated with secondhand smoke and that was not assessed in the Harvard study to which Moran just referred the Harvard study was using the Harvard study that I referred to as using nicotine as a marker nicotine being the one thing that you can say comes absolutely from cigarettes carbon monoxide coming from many different sources, let's go to another question for the moment and the earlier today we had Bob from Elmhurst who was visiting the merchandise Martin had this question for us when I would really be interested in knowing is how does it affect your health when you work in a very small office with two people who smoke and stumbling okay I mean that's really a key issue your response that really comes to the heart of is environmental tobacco smoke harmful to the average nonsmoker, there have been about 16 studies to date that have looked at the impact of environmental tobacco smoking on diseases in non-smokers those have come to varying conclusions what we can say at this point is though that there have been three scientific conferences to internationally one by the National Institutes of Health there are basic conclusion all three of them the evidence is not there to support the contention that environmental tobacco smoke is harmful to the average nonsmoker you accept that evidence absolutely, that's absolutely false first of all tobacco has absolutely no redeeming values whatsoever nothing good can be said about tobacco or tobacco smoke it contrary to build the belief that if quiets your nerves were talking about about your tobacco affecting me well if it is a if it's obviously detrimental to me there's no way shape or manner in which you could be beneficial or advantageous to you there have been contrary to what we just heard in, in at least half a dozen studies to show that the incidence of malignancy of cancers among the spouses of smokers is significantly higher than the frequency of cancer among non-smokers so it does for the conflicting studies that I mentioned there's Mike from Elmhurst not sit in that office with his two co-workers who were smoking I think it's really a comfort issue here that we have is my if Mike is uncomfortable then he ought to seek some sort of reasonable accommodations as the smoker should be able to see, accommodations should they wish to smoke in the office okay Roger from Chicago you have this question for us yes I would like to know what is the danger of living with a smoker and I like to know is it possible to get cancer by Helen other people smoke so there's a young person what is the danger that might happen long time on the road okay we've tried to answer some of that but the issue at home I think that's kind of important dr. kugel yes the chance is the you individually, ER will develop a cancer are relatively small if your spouse or loved ones there any circumstances but the chances are increased and measurably so if your spouse smokes the studies that have looked at the spouses It's usually the wives again are very conflicting and there are studies which show no increased risk so we have to go back to what the three scientific conferences said you know no scientific evidence as to the risk, Laura from Roselle was at the Mart earlier had this question, I'm pregnant does passive smoking representative special risk for me, just bread I haven't seen any studies I think there have been a couple that have tried to measure the exposure and have found it very difficult to do so that's Google is the fetus at risk if smokers in the house I really don't know but I come back to my general statement earlier that smoking has no redeeming value whatsoever it's harmful to those who are exposed to it it cannot possibly be good for the fetus and if or the lack of any evidence that it's harmful I would prefer to be cautious and not, suppose the child except to the minimum amount well unfortunately we had a little redeeming times so that we're going to have to thank you Brenda Moran for the tobacco Institute dr. David koudelka yell from the American Lung Association thank you for your calls I wish we could have taken more obviously this is a very very sensitive and emotional topic I'll be back at 10:00 tonight with a look at a disturbing report about televisions effect on teen suicides and of course next week you'll have another chance to ask the doctor Ron Deborah thank you very",0.8451452800000001,0.75721204,0.91283846
ffwk0146,"17 after right now yesterday the government released a new report on smoking and health which said that there is no excuse me that there is that there is overwhelming evidence that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and is a major factor in heart disease the tobacco industry says that there is no repeat no conclusive evidence that smoking causes cancer or heart disease yesterday we discussed this new, report with the United States Surgeon General Julius Richmond and John Penny of health education welfare and this morning Bill Dwyer was vice president the tobacco Institute is with us and Steve Bell joins our conversation from Washington good morning mr. Dwyer good morning David thank you very much first of all, the industry naturally tobacco industry wants people to smoke if people if everybody put smoking then there wouldn't be an industry anymore we want them to be able to make a choice shoes right to make a choice of sure but if everybody made the choice to quit smoking then of course there wouldn't let say be any more tobacco industry so it's in the interest of the industry to keep people smoking if they're going to continue to make a profit why should the public believe you as opposed to, to believing the Surgeon General and all the doctors and reports from David I don't think it's quite so much a matter of believing US versus someone else it's believing what the facts are and the facts shouldn't all come from a single Source it isn't really just our statement of contradiction or difference with the Surgeon General there are many independent men and women of science who don't believe that the causal conclusion yet has been reached David we don't, neither that there is statistical evidence smokers in Greater number than non-smokers do fall victim to these various diseases but we must remember that for example most smokers don't develop lung cancer and certain non-smokers do as well we think it's an open question mr. Dwyer Steve Bell and Washington when you talk though about one source as I understand it you're not talking about One Source you're talking about the government compiling the statistic or statistics from some 30,000 different studies done by all types of research people, people and the government says that along with the people you site there is still overwhelming evidence Steve the term overwhelming itself represents a judgment there are differing points of view even within the Expressions that are contained in the surgeon general's report but don't you think that there is perhaps a more fundamental question or at least we do and that is warning the Surgeon General has determined there isn't a soul in this country except perhaps a cave dweller who, of missed that message it's imprinted on the American awareness at that point our position is that individuals ought to be free to choose not children by the way adults they've been put on notice and whether it's aspirin or sweeteners or swordfish or now beer this week as I heard you report Steve or pan-fried hamburgers last summer there are so many incriminated items we think Americans after the information has been passed ought to be able to come to their own conclusion do you think smoking is healthy, David I haven't personally right now I know you were back when student but personally I understand and I think that's I think it's a reasonable question I don't know frankly I think that Smoking may be hazardous it may not be I believe that science has got to find out whether or not what the statistics suggest can be proved in fact I happen to be a smoker Dwyer the report the from the government says that a pregnant that pregnant women who smoke are more likely to have low birth weight babies babies with more problems that the babies and, will be deprived of oxygen if your wife or daughter were pregnant right now would you be worried would you be encouraging her to continue smoking or not to smoke Steve I wouldn't be encouraging or discouraging because that's not my mission either as an individual or as a representative of the tobacco industry in the cigarette manufacturers I would be encouraging as a husband or a father to listen to the advice of the physician to read think to be aware and then to again come to the own conclusion, if your physician has a physician ever said to you mr. Dwyer hey stop smoking you know maybe all the evidence is in but it's pretty clear that that's not helping David has a doctor ever sat in my last physical here in New York City I won't name her but the internist who gave me the examination sat me down in her office afterwards to review the matters and she said now let's see which side are you on is it all right if I smoke and I said yes doctor in my presence at least it is what what about, low-tar low-nicotine drive now one response of the industry to what's happened is obviously public relations to get out and do just what you're doing now what about the cigarette manufacturing process is the industry going to continue to go for lower tar and nicotine Steve I like your word response because in fact the low tar and nicotine cigarettes are a form of response not necessarily however to assault but to Market preference a meeting of the demand in the market, from the companies to provide that products not an admission though no it's certainly not an admission because it would be a tortured one wouldn't it to say that this was a less hazardous cigarette because it would imply that something else were more hazardous and no one yet knows that what we do know of course is that there is a certain Siberia to which those who would disagree with the Healthline even from H ew can get sent to we remember the situation of dr. gorrie in the less hazardous cigarette flap Got 5 Seconds when are you going to quit, when I choose to and I haven't yet reached that point and don't think I will like the store will be back just a couple minutes, when it comes to regulation this time the government has almost as many approaches as there are problems for instance at one extreme the new surgeon general's report labels smoking the largest preventable cause of death in America Public Health Enemy Number One but not even Secretary of huw califano the point man and the anti-smoking campaign thinks the government should do more than educate and Warren despite massive alleged Public Health costs there's overwhelming consensus of individual smoke, jurors should be free to choose their risks for themselves at The Other Extreme think of food additives there's not much Freedom of Choice their federal law no less says any additive that produces cancer and man or animals is unsafe and unless that law is changed as of May well be and I think should be the government will have no choice but to ban saccharin despite its many uses because massive doses of saccharin produced bladder cancer in rats finally a middle example seat belts in cars, no question about there saving lives but when we were merely warned many of us chose not to use them when they put buzzers on we disconnected them so that ended free choice now we're going to have air bags or automatic belts beginning on the biggest new cars in 1982 like them or not what most people want I think is to be protected from things such as air pollution and dirty food that we as individuals can do nothing about but to be left free to choose for ourselves those risks we could avoid if we wanted to, but finding the fair and affordable line between those two that remains as always one of this town's most demanding Arts this is Bob Abernathy and Washington Washington Frank Reynolds good evening the federal government is about to make another massive attempt to discourage cigarette smoking tomorrow the Surgeon General will issue a new report on the relationship between smoking and health and even before the document becomes public the tobacco industry has denounced it we have to report, ports on the cigarette War tonight first here is Margaret Hosmer, the first surgeon general's report on smoking in 15 years is not expected to provide startling new information but confirmation of the various ways that cigarette smoking is disabling and killing Americans the report is a compilation and Analysis of studies done by different experts in the scientific Community it reportedly expresses special concern about the increase in smoking among teenage girls that smoking Cisco California only do they risk long-term disease but they may suffer, lung damage when they first pick up that cigarette the report also is expected to repeat warnings about smoking and pregnancy earlier Studies have shown a correlation between smoking what we smoking adults they're a size babies and the atw official reportedly said the study will show that 15 years later there is still no good easy way to help people quit the tobacco Institute today blast most spokesman admitted they had not yet seen but they said they didn't need to see it to know that, it would be an unfair attack it was suspect from the start H ew secretary califano launched his anti-smoking campaign a year ago with all the Zeal of a reformed sinner America beware if Joe califano ever gives up drinking or other pleasure Pursuits even the most intimate The Institute tried to counter tomorrow's report even further Jin General prepare a new report America, beware if Joe califano ever gives up drinking or other pleasure Pursuits even the most intimate atw secretary Joseph califano has not replied to the personal attacks upon him he's reserved all comment until the official release of the surgeon general's report tomorrow morning at 11 a.m. Margaret ozma ABC News Washington this is Charles Gibson there have not been many victories in Joseph califano swore again smoking polls show over 80% of Americans no smoking, dangerous but the cigarette industry thrives and my grandmother would Harden five years old she's smoking Jude back over life and I guess she did I guess if I could finally killed her color photo talked of raising the excise tax on cigarettes which has been eight cents a pack since 1951 it is still eight cents he talked of a stiffer warnings on cigarette packages the wording remains unchanged and califano talked of cooperation with the Network's to get more exposure for a, anti-smoking commercials, the idea has been dropped most of what he promised in January was simply that he was going to ask other people to do things so far as we know none of them have agreed to do it he has done nothing else there is no war against smoking indeed most of the advances against smoking of come from pressures outside government rather than from within cigarette advertising was pulled off TV in 1971 after strong lobbying by non-government anti-smoking groups, would you like smoking or non-smoking thank you and non-smoking sections on airplanes were established in 1973 only after pressure from the same groups the essential problem is that smoking is big business and government has long recognized that fact hundreds of thousands of American families look to tobacco for their livelihood the integral nature of the tobacco industry in American life was probably best reflected by Jimmy Carter's trips to North Carolina since the time his H ew secretary started his War, on smoking mr. Carter went there bearing reassurance has there are two million families in our country that depend for their livelihood on the back up as long as I'm in the white house we will have a good Loan program for tobacco in the federal government so despite the califano war real government pressure against smoking like cutting out price support loans to Tobacco farmers are declaring tobacco an addictive drug is unlikely we now have 15 years of, for it's showing tobacco is dangerous and we still have 54 million Americans smoking Charles Gibson ABC News Washington, West Germany's Cancer Research Center said today that most of some 150 beers it tested contain traces of a cancer-causing substance nitrosamine no American beers were tested but us Brewers are conducting their own tests and suspect the results will be similar the researchers say however that this substance can be eliminated from the beer through new Brewing methods, world",0.8513618123333334,0.74545485,0.912839
ffxh0257,"on the record at 12:49 p.m., okay before we took a lunch break mrs. dilber we're talking about exhibit number 9 and page number 9, if you could just take a look at that you believe testified that you prepared this chart these charts that are reflected here is that right yes I believe so okay and, believe we left off we're talking about some of the Strategic imperatives that the, specialty generics business would have to undertake in your view too, ultimately increase its net sales looking forward is that fair to sign the form I wouldn't say that it was my view what would you say about that it was a collaborative view of leadership within the business and who include who do you include in that group, it was our marketing team and I guess the the president of the business at that time who was who I'm sorry who was the president has said that time it's a good question I believe it was, give me a second I'm blanking on his name, Walt cuz Marik, where was mr. kasmir egg located at that time our business was in Hazelwood at that time is it hasn't moved since then yes it has where is it now Webster Groves Missouri where is that in relation to Hazelwood eight or ten miles south, what prompted the physical move, it was a decision there was a decision made to co-locate the business with the R&D group, party is research and development research and development, who made that decision I don't know, okay so the Strategic imperatives listed here on page 9 of exhibit 9 number one was a choir up to 300 million in net sales through two or three focused Acquisitions approximately 1 billion dollar investment DC that I do okay is this thing stand today are there have those Acquisitions occurred, now here are they contemplated at this time now, the second bullet point is invest 5% to 7% of specialty generic sales back into R&D to build pipeline value you see that as that happened I don't know this specific percentages but we have invested in R&D is there, are there any opioid products being currently developed, yes what are they, we have an abuse deterrent formulation of Oxycodone, we're final couple of strengths of fentanyl patch, those are the ones that come to mind in terms of opioids okay what was the one you said before the fentanyl patch for federal and he's felt that one Ellie VOR PHA nol, what is that, I don't know the specifics on the product, was rocks ecotone developed prior to well is Roxy codone actually on the market now, Roxy could own is on the market today yes when did that enter the market I don't know, was it on the market in 2016 I believe so, as a Mallinckrodt product I believe so, the next bullet is build and a and d a culture that will grow sales over time and drive value what does that mean, and is abbreviated new drug application so it's a generic drug filing so it was basically, the developed those capabilities to generate and getting ideas approved, okay next operate on a standalone basis what does that mean, this was carved the business out and the resources dedicated to the business I believe was also part of the move to Webster Groves to stand the business up on its own, upgrade Talent across functions with dedicated Rd M and A and Regulatory resources what does that all mean, Rd is research and development MMA is mergers and acquisitions, so I don't know the specifics of that comment did that come from somebody other than you yet to be clear the graphs came from me if this the strategy piece of it would have come from someone else okay this last bullet point diluting specialty generics Financial impact over time via growth in specialty Brands enabling optionality what does that all mean, again those are my comments so I could speculate but I'm not going to do that okay do you know who generated that comment specifically I don't know who had final say in this lies, ultimately this presentation was given by Matt Harbaugh's area, his name is on the front page but you know whether he actually needed I don't know for sure that he actually gave the presentation did he have final approval over all the slides to your knowledge to my knowledge, I don't know, why is the business the generics business declining, it got to be a very competitive Marketplace, any other reasons, but I think the formation of the three big binders we discussed earlier they leverage purchasing power which eroded pricing, when a, salesperson for, Mallinckrodt goes out to talk to potential generics customers, do they promote particular products in those discussions before I am not privy to those conversations, have you ever reviewed the Consolidated financial statements of Mallinckrodt the ones that get sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission, I've reviewed our filings online how often do you do that, just on occasion I see the earnings releases that Mallinckrodt publishes quarterly, do you review the quarterly filings every quarter no have you ever reviewed the entirety of the Consolidated financial statements, that I recall, what role do you have if any in creating the Consolidated financial statements that are filed with the SEC yeah it really don't have a role in and those financial statements information from businesses that you're involved in, ultimately gets input into that financial statement right the Consolidated financial statements that's the first statement it's embarrassing yes okay how does it get from you to the Consolidated financial statement through our financial systems, what is that, is that a thing or group or know it's a thing it's a system so our businesses on j.d. Edwards and the results from JD Edwards feed into Hyperion planning system, Hyperion yeah hyp e RI o n, okay, I'll send somebody pulls it out of that system yes ohh Hyperion planning essentially as a download of our trial balance at a point in time,have you ever had a situation where well let me back up do you know who actually prepares the Consolidated financial statements, specifically no you know what group does it, I believe it's our sccp reporting group, where are they located Hazelwood Missouri, do you know any names of people involved in that group I do first of all who heads it and if you know Megan Roberts, okay and who else is involved in that group, Stacy Phillips, and enter a woman that's a man a woman I mean and there's a Patrick I can't think this last name and Kyle again blanking on his last name, have you ever been contacted by anyone with the SEC reporting group to ask you about any of the information that they were going to include in the Consolidated financial statement, sure I've worked with them with just questions I have from time to time, do you remember any specific instances, a recently I've answered specific questions I've had about our form 10 filing that's upcoming it's for the specialty generics business yes what were the what was the question for questions it was in relation to stand alone cost versus allocations to the business, do you know why the companies file a Consolidated Financial system, no, were you involved in any way in the decision to file a Consolidated financial statement now do you have you ever seen a draft of the Consolidated financial statement before it was actually sent to the Securities Exchange Commission, that's my recollection, do we have any color versions of the song, Mark is exhibit number 10, it's mnk dt1 underscore 000 7870 747 through, 08-30, all right this last copies over a get the mouse but he just slipped off, one for you 10 yes, right so this is a big document with I don't know 80 Pages or so I'm not going to ask you about every single page so you can review as much of this as you want I'll direct you to the specific pages that I'm going to ask about but you can review as much as you want for context my first question of you ever seen this presentation before today I believe so okay and what context did you see it, I believe my boss of time George gabler provided me a copy did he, did you play any role in either preparing this or providing information that ultimately was assimilated into this document yes as we went through a sale process sales process I provided quite a bit of information okay we'll take it do you remember first by category what type of information you provided, sales information and, brings information I believe, okay so what was looking at the just the first page here it says August 2017 project Georgetown management presentation so what what is this what is the purpose of this document the purpose of the document was for management presentations that were made to potential buyers what was credit suisse's role in that they were the bankers on, on our side, was this actually presented to potential buyers I believe so were you involved in those presentations no I was not who on the Mallinckrodt side was involved in the actual presentations if you look at page 3 there's a, looks like some photographs, yeah as I said I wasn't in those presentations but it says today's presenters, you know whether this was presented more than one time,I don't know for sure you know who the potential buyer was there there were a couple of potential buyers yes you know who they were yes who are they in toss, how do you spell that I ntas okay and we're have been do, any others, Platinum capital, and those are the three that I recall we're the work is in toss is that a drug company yes how about order of in do yes and platinum Capital private equity, were you involved in any of the discussions within any of those entities or any other potential buyers yes what was your role in that in those discussions it was generally diligence, which one's all three,how did how did that work with did they contact you with specific questions or, it went through the bankers, and the bankers would ask you specific questions or for specific information yes or set up meetings in did you actually have meetings with representatives from the potential buyers I did, with each of the three of the potential buyers, face to face new Platinum capital and, I don't remember which of the two, Indian Pharma companies that was but one of those and then calls with all three do you remember the nature of the questions that they had for you, not specifically it was all over her about everything, who else on the Mallinckrodt side was involved in those discussions, from a finance perspective yeah the discovery of the discussions that you were involved in yeah so generally George Keller was my boss of time he would have been in those conversations and depending upon subject matter potentially Angie Thomas on Gross to net, but it would probably would have been the three of us who is Angie Thomas she is our manager of gross to net accounting, she would be knowledgeable about the, charge backs and rebate programs yes, did any of the potential buyers in the discussions you're involved in have questions about potential liability for lawsuits resulting from the opioids portion of the business, not in the conversations that I was involved, did you leaving aside with lawyers told you did you ever hear about concerns by the potential buyers about liability for opioids related lawsuits,sure I mean Opie with litigation opioid litigation is a part of this business today so I'm sure there were concerns on buyers behalf, do you did you hear about them expressing that concern to anyone, yes I was aware that there were discussions about, opioid liabilities, do you know why well a backup did any of the three potential buyers actually make an offer to buy the company, I don't know, do you know why the there was never a sales of the company to any of those three bars or any other buyer, I don't know, we heard anything about why the none of the three buyers or no one else actually purchased company,no, I can speculate again but you know I don't want to do that okay well what do you have any, any information about why they didn't buy the company, now many suspicions about why yes your suspicion is ejected full, I don't I think it was not, but they didn't want to buy maybe but that maybe there wasn't the value that melon cry wanted from the business they have an asking price for it I don't find it wasn't aware of a specific asking price, you think Mallinckrodt was over valuing the business and their minds I don't know,who would set the price for the specialty generics business who within the company would be the decision maker on that I don't know if you look at one, of exhibit 10, it says credit Swiss Securities USA LLC has been retained by Mallinckrodt PLC referred to here after as Mallinckrodt or the company to serve as its exclusive financial advisor in connection with the sale called the transaction of its specialty generics business unit hereinafter referred to as Georgetown do you say that so was it Mallinckrodt PLC that was selling the specialty generis business, again you're talking about a legal entity and to my knowledge legal entities don't make decisions, people to your right that's right you know which people were making these decisions, I would imagine that a transaction of this nature wouldn't be made without consent from the board of directors of Mallinckrodt PLC of Mallinckrodt, again whatever they call them, is that fair to sir, when you think of a Mountaintop board of directors are you thinking of the Mallinckrodt PLC board of directors I'm thinking about the board of directors for the publicly traded company the publicly traded company is called Bella crop PLC I don't know, when you read the earnings reports quarterly the general look to see who's making the announcement honestly now I don't look at the detail so I look at the big picture and the news that's coming out and what the earnings look like do you own stock in Mountain a small small amount was that something that was connected to your compensation from the company yes, lease a small amount that means different things to different people we can use a ballpark on the value of the stock you old hold in Mallinckrodt, I think all told vested unvested today twenty thousand dollars and you see you know that sounds like a lot to me so, everybody has a different view you have unvested stock options in Mallinckrodt PLC or whatever the mallik road publicly traded company is yes, when in time will those fast, I don't know the specifics I haven't looked at in a while, what will the impact financially be for you on the spin-off of the specialty generics business, I have no idea, have you looked at what the impact on shareholders will be of that spin-off I have not, so let's, look through we're an exhibit 10,it would have been handy to have like two years ago, let's let's look at first page 3 of exhibit 10 that one with the pictures of the, six and one, your boss back in 2017 was still George keckler yes and his boss the time was dr. Frank scholes, no ok who is George cacklers boss so at the time quite something Finance reports through Finance so his boss was Matt harpole CFO, Was Dina why Matt Harbaugh was not involved in this presentation in August of 2017 Matt was not a part of this business at that time, what was his role in 2017 Chief Financial Officer of the company oh I see okay, I think I understand so the lines of report mr.

Louis plant leading to significant savings do you say that I do okay what is that right folks do it's in reference to a building that we built that are seeing this plant we had a very aged process and we believe that we were one of the, last people processing opium is very labor intensive for a number of reasons we wanted to get out of that building can into a more modern building so this really just replace an old facility and what is the new chemistry for hydrocodone what does that mean it just meant that we were not opium wasn't our starting material it was from poppy straw, and out of poppy straw you can create hydrocodone, not a chemist but yes, is there a difference between the hydrocodone that comes from poppy straw versus the hydrocodone that comes from opium I don't know, do you have any patents, I don't have any patents now every ever, applied for a patent I have not ever participated in developing, anything that led to a patent, no, what is the name for the spin-off company going to be melon cry, who is going to own the name Mallinckrodt if you now, because it's in terms of intellectual property, the name is coming with the spinoff, is it just Mallinckrodt is there some other name to it you know they're part of the name I don't know,do you know who Angus Russell is, I right pardon me I recognize the name I believe he's on our board of directors, were you on, a phone call for you on a phone call with an investor phone call in December of 2018 where the spin-off was announced, December of 2008 Yes just you know two months ago our son, do you know the date I do it was believed December the 6th early December they've been the fifth of 2018, I believe I was on that call, Matthew Harbaugh spoke on the call and some other people do you remember that yes okay, were you in the room with mr. Harbaugh when he was on that call now we're worried, I don't know either my office or at home, do you typically work out of the office yes, do you have a home office as well no this was a call it started at 7:30 a.m., so you're already at your desk for a couple hours, okay so do you, you recall who else spoke on that come phone call, I believe from Archer do anyone else I don't recall anyone else, do you remember a discussion on that call about the cash impact of any sort of opioid settlement, not specifically not if you remember somebody some Executives saying that, the cash impact from any sort of opioid settlement was probably a number of years away, don't specifically remember that do you remember somebody raising the issue of the opioids lawsuits, I honestly remember very little about the call, is there a reason why you remember very little about it I think there's just yeah so much going on that everything's a blur let me you know we've been gone what you guys wanna take a break, we're going off the Record at 1:42 p.m., we are back on the record at 149 p.m., mr. Cooper we've marked as exhibit 11 a document that has on the front Mallinckrodt plans spin-off of specialty generics business to shareholders so it's news provided by Mallinckrodt PLC December 6 2018 at six Eastern do you see that, yes okay and if you flip to the last page it says nine of nine, the third line from the bottom there says Source Mallinckrodt PLC related links WWE mail.com you see that yes I'll represent to you that this was printed from the leaf and melon crowd website directly yes I'm sorry this I take that back this is printed from the pr newswire it's a news release that apparently came from a Lacroix that's what all represent to you first of all you seen this, document ever, or some version of this press release, I had seen some brochure on the press release okay did you see a draft version or something after it was released to the public after it was released to the public okay, did you know about this announcement before it was made to the public, I did, if you look at the top of the second page it's starts with the planned separation there, do you see that yes okay the second sentence says the spin-off is projected to be completed in the second half of 2019 or sooner you see that yes okay, thank you said earlier that your understanding is the current plan is to complete the spit off in the summer of 2019 is that right I believe so is that on track still I don't know, have you ever seen a internal timeline for tasks that need to be completed in order to complete the spinoff, I'm currently working to put together some internal timelines or internal activities that need to be transitioned from a finance perspective, from a finance perspective will the spin off these terms of the tasks that the finance group needs to finish will that be ready in summers 2019, I would expect so, the next sentence or the next paragraph refers to the remaining specialty pharmaceutical Brands company is there a second spin-off contemplates a spin-off of second company contemplated as well not to my knowledge okay, the last sentence there says the remaining company will be renamed at a later date to see that yes do you have any idea what the name of that remaining company will be, no I do not, mr. Russell and gets Russell Ballard crowds chairman of the board again that's the board of Mallinckrodt PLC to your understanding, the board of Mallinckrodt, he said and this is in quotes and we'll get the second sentence in 2016 the board began to explore a range of strategic alternatives for the company's specialty generics business and believes there is a strong rationale and opportunity to create two new appropriately capitalized independent companies to have the potential to unlock and increase value over the long term you see that I do okay is that consistent with your, or information that it was 2016 when the board began to explore a range of strategic alternatives for the specialty generics business, I believe so,mr. Trudeau said this is the fourth paragraph on page 2 of exhibit 11 mr. Trudeau said quote today's announcement is another important step forward in our journey to become an innovation driven pure-play specialty pharmaceutical Brands Growth Company do you see that what is pure play mean check the Forum, I would be speculating have you ever heard that term before, I have do you have it in your mind any notion of what that means I do okay what is that, the want to be a Brand's only company, other words no generic products, yes okay if you flip over to see the third page of exhibit 11,third paragraph Matthew harbach currently Mallinckrodt Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer CFO and president especially generics business is expected to become president and chief executive officer of the new company upon completion of the spin-off to see that I do is that still the plan as far as you know, yes and as president and chief executive officer who would mr. harbach report to you, board of directors so who what is that box you said earlier that's empty currently on the organizational chart has a CFO okay is that a job that you would like to be considered for no did you know who is being considered for that, I've met with one potential candidate, now be somebody who be your boss yes, is there any reason you don't want that job, from all work life perspective yes there are many okay, if you flip to, I guess the before 585 where it says conference call and webcast, his Mallinckrodt will hold a conference call on Thursday December the 6th 2018 beginning at 8:00 a.m. eastern we see that that that was a call that you were on yes did you speak on that call now, the the bottom of this page it says, about the specialty generics disposal group do you see that I do what is the specialty generous disposal group, our business was placed into discontinued operations and February of 2018 at that time they referred to the business as the special you generics disposal group it was the assets that were group for a transaction, do you know whether an impairment on the specialty generics assets was ever included on the Consolidated financial statements I do not, did you have any role in, any discussions about including an impairment for those assets, no, do you know what the criteria are for, including an impairment of Goodwill for a business, not specifically you know whether that was ever done with respect to the specialty generics business amount of God I do was it done yes okay when was that don't remember exactly do you know why it was done our technical Accounting Group routinely reviews and our intangibles to just to be sure that they're not impaired, at some point it was determined that the intangibles were impaired, I presume, do you know who made that decision I do not, how did you learn that there is an impairment reflected on the Consolidated financial statement for the Goodwill associated with this specialty generis business I would have been in earnings release typically the numbers I review or non-gaap, and then the SEC group puts him in the Gap is that how it works essentially it's non-gaap in that it excludes amortization of Goodwill just gives a little bit better picture of how the business is operating and it would include exclude impairments in those some of those type of things and at what point where is the impairment calculated, as I said as our technical Accounting Group that does that, what is the technical Accounting Group, what is it yeah is that what you said technical kind of group yeah what does it say it technical accounting and SEC reporting is a group in our within our control ership corporate controller ship group, okay and that's the SEC is the technical Accounting in the SEC group the same group yes, is that the group Megan Roberts is group yes, yeah,did you give the copy, marked as exhibit number 12, let's call this a collective exhibit and what it is too, excerpts from it's one excerpt from the Mallinckrodt 10-q for a to 12:30 of 16 and then the second or third page has an excerpt from Mallinckrodt nq9 2818 it relates to the same issue that I want to ask you about which is the impairment so you take as much time to review this what I'm going to ask you about first is paragraph 10 which is, on the second page of Goodwill and intangible assets, Okay so, do you know how to read the, notes to the condensed Consolidated financial statement, probably depends upon the note okay well let's look at Note 10 here Goodwill and intangible assets says the gross carrying amount of Goodwill by segment at the end of each period where as follows, there's a specialty Brands and specially generics lines there you see those I'll represent you the highlighting is something that we've added that wasn't on me, the document filed with the SEC so for December 30th of 2016, specialty generics is showing an accumulated impairment of 207 million, you see the I do okay what does that mean, if anything about the value of the Goodwill for the company ejected form if you know, I believe it means that it was impaired, okay and is there at this time does this filing with the Securities Exchange Commission show any impairment for the specialty Brands business, does not, do you know why this impairment was recognized and they Consolidated financial statement in 2016, I believe it was a result of the impairment analysis that was performed by our technical Accounting Group, okay, do you know what the impact on a financial statement is when there's an impairment recognized of Goodwill, the impact on I'm sorry have financial statement yes sir it would reduce your assets it would also be a charge to income, when did you first learn that the Mallinckrodt PLC it's all dated financial statement reflected a impairment of 207 million dollars especially generics business assets which I generally do not see Consolidated financial statements until their release to the public what did you learn, immediately upon the release to the public or could you learn some later point about that quite honestly I don't remember, did you agree with that decision when you first learned about it, again those analyses are prepared by that technical Accounting Group,did you have an opinion one way or the other as to whether that was the correct course of action, based on the information I have no I do not, if you ever heard of an entity called the Mallinckrodt international finance essay, I've I have what is that entity I don't know and I would have thought of myths when he said that so I don't really I've heard it, in what context did you hear about it legal entity discussions, with whom would have been other Mallinckrodt Finance Finance Personnel work tax personnel, did you ever work for Mallinckrodt international finance essay, again I don't know which legal entity I work for I work for Malachi okay I'm out have you ever heard of Mallinckrodt CB LLC, CB right like MCB maybe heard that term no no okay are there two entities called Mallinckrodt ink, I don't know sounds confusing, does, okay have you ever been involved with making a calculation called net debt leverage ratio, no you know what that is I've heard it discussed honoring skulls, have you heard of an organization called Mallinckrodt securitization, now, okay I may be about finish one of we do this let's take a break and I want to talk to my lawyer,

fghb0039,"it's getting pretty late when I hit the trail when you Snoop around for a living like I do it ain't a 9 to 5 job, I knew it was my kind of case the minute I got window, not exactly what you'd call open and shut a map with a message follow the trail of genuine taste something about it I don't know it had a familiar smell like a road I've been down before like a road I definitely wanted to travel again the trail picked up on, on 5th Street and a diner called Joe's Lounge happens to be a hangout of mine I walk in sniffing for Clues and I pick one up right off the bat a familiar Roma like a good smoke like a camel filter hey Roger, mr. O'Leary's waiting for you I wouldn't expect any reception but I knew the name Ned Leary that's about tobacco one of our Jr.'s senior Marketing Manager for Camel and Winston Brands the Larry yep, the come from you, I had something to do with it, so what am I looking for the secret to camels taste it's genuine taste, you can let me in on it strategy consumer strategy sales strategy a way to let the smoking public know, who else needs to be in on it our sales force naturally we're adding a whole new dimension to camel a product story told through personal selling I'm talking about one-on-one sales rep to smoke huh, tell me more we're adding to the Arsenal upping the ante with a product message that will set camel apart from the competition the only one with genuine taste, nice angle the only angle and effective selling tool you think they'll use it they use every good tool they can get their hands on, gonna wait till daylight tomorrow's too late they need this information right away if they want to build their volume and share I got a feeling there's something else going on here,where is everybody knows camels were roaring success thanks to the big guy Joe camp but Joe can't carry the entire load by himself he might be the most popular spokes camel of all time but he needs a product message even Joe knows he's been bugging us for one message the consumer will remember a message that will leverage the true strength of camp and that can be only one thing camels genuine taste, I got an idea I can draw you a picture it's a pyramid camels at the top of course Jose over here doing his part but the brand needs more support that's where genuine taste comes in It's the final leg, it's been there the whole time you bet but out of sight we're putting it in lights where everybody can see it just a minute Larry there's more Jim vest I should have known it RJ r--'s area VP for Southern Sales a heavy hitter, I wondered what his angle was on camels genuine taste it's what we've been missing we hardly ever met a smoker who doesn't like the big guy the big guy Joe Camel but the product then the hurdle now we're going to work that point was something we can own something unique it starts with an 80-year tradition of quality born in 1913, the camel brand stands for Quality like Levi Harley and Zippo they're still around not because we're just okay but because they've always been the best just like camel, you've been keeping this under your hat, just putting it together in a neat package we're making the secret of chemists popularity known to the smoking public a time-tested blend of three premium tobacco we were the first to do it and guess why we did it to strike the right balance between flavor and smoothness and we're still using the three tobacco blend today, the biggest competitor doesn't seem to need a product story what do you think come to where the flavor is means they don't separate their image from the product neither can we we've got the image Advantage but we've got to hit harder on product 80 years worth it smoking Styles have changed over the last 80 years that's exactly right and today there's a style of camel that's right for every smoker 14 Styles and all each one, distinctively balanced for smooth rich flavor but all delivering genuine taste okay you build a mighty strong case for smokers to switch the camera mr. best

fhfk0146,"tonight from Washington Crossfire Saturday smoking in the skies no ifs ands or butts on the left part green on the right Fred Barnes in the crossfire Brennan Moran of the tobacco Institute and are enlightened president of citizens against tobacco smoke good evening welcome to Crossfire Saturday coffee tea or cancer that's what anti-smoking advocates, think would be an accurate question from Airline attendants why because they say breathing secondhand smoke in a closed cabinet is a health hazard this week the Senate passed the bill which would ban all smoking on domestic flights less than 90 minutes previously the state of California Air Canada and the House of Representatives enacted similar measures however smoking Advocates insist they have rights too and at any health effects are negligible so is this bill a breath of fresh air or just, other example of Congress as our national Nanny will Reagan signed the legislation should he Fred mr. Lightman I don't smoke I think people who smoke are nothing if they smoke I mean it's a crazy idea is clearly bad for your health but you know I go on flights two or three times a week round trip and smoke has never bothered me it's never irritated me and I've never heard a single person and I talked to a lot of people on flights complain about smoke bothering them how do you explain that well that surprises me because of the nation's 90,000 flight, I'd spent an average of 900 hours per year working in The Airliner cabin and they complain plenty well some of them do not all ninety thousand of them well American Airlines their flight at today or recently did a survey and they showed that 87% on an average were physically harmed by tobacco smoke in The Airliner cabin they want something done there are 450 million passenger trips this year that are going to be made an overwhelming majority of people choose to sit in the non-smoking section they're held hostage, the minority about 12 percent who chew out smoking flight call me ask you about your proof that you have that there's actual Health harm to people sitting in the non-smoking section and having smoke hurt them what what sort of in flight testing evidence do you have the National Academy of Sciences examined this issue a year ago August overwhelmingly a majority said but I know what smoking, did they do in the cabin of airplanes very simple when flight attendants and when passengers get migraine headaches from tobacco smoke that is certainly proof enough when you're saying they didn't do any let's get your side of the story even Fred said the sentence smoking is dangerous do you think smoking causes or contributes to cancer for the smoker I think the smoker has to make that decision that's not my question do you think smoking, let's start at the beginning contribute to our causes cancer statistically there are associations in terms of biological causation that hasn't been found which is why I came to the conclusion that smokers have to make up their own minds we all know what the surgeon general's warning say and in fact the vast majority of people believe it so I think we're intelligent enough is adults to make up our minds when it comes to legislating when and where people can smoke in the airline cabin is a perfect example that has to do with a whole separate range of issues, oh and to answer question previously asked the National Academy of Sciences dude no in Flight testing in fact all of the in Flight testing that's been done and there have been four tests of such have shown in tobacco smoke in the airline cabin isn't a problem isn't that warrant those studies done by the tobacco industry one of those studies was done by the tobacco industry there's a Japanese study there's a federal study in their sister lattice parameter as between taxpayer supported federal agencies like the office of smoking and health the Surgeon General the National Academy of Sciences they, I think that involuntary smoking on airplanes is dangerous to the person who doesn't smoke and it should be banned why should the public believe those objective critics rather than purchased scientists by the tobacco industry doesn't matter who does the the testing was not supported by systematic, testing that is absolutely wrong start it is naive to believe that an industry that produces an addictive in a lethal product would ever admit to any harm associated with the u-33 harms anybody, airplanes had their smoking causes harm to non-smokers let me ask you about the test that are underway right now as I understand it by the Environmental Protection Administration by the labor department by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Transportation they're doing a study on whether there is harm there or not why not wait for their study to be completed before you go in and get this ban on all smoking on airline prices non-smokers have been guinea pigs for too long and they are harmed by it we had three, Federal reports issued last year within a five month period to prove that there is harm associated with better than other wise healthy nonsmoker August the NES airliner study overwhelmingly supported in worldwide web and I can recommend here the former secretary, Transportation Secretary General took a look at that study and said in fact that what she wanted what her Federal agency with the experts wanted was in Flight testing that's what is suggested to towards ourselves that's right he didn't include the NES passive smoking study released in November or the surgeon general's report she totally ignored it one of those, hours a day their eyes water their circuit regulatory functions are impaired if I could quote mr. reichman's favorite study the surgeon general's the surgeon general's report says that there is no allergy to tobacco smoke let's go back to the airline I do remember remember well let's go back to the humidity somewhere in the range of two to four percent that causes those symptoms that causes the dry eyes the scratchy throat all of those things are talking about, Valdez are can be attributed or traced in part to smoking that's what they said I'm sad let me ask you mr. Lightman about some of the claims that have been made by people like yourself who opposed any smoking on airline flights and of course you're not just interested in Banning smoking on the flights of 90 minutes or less you want to ban it entirely on all the lights and on all forms of public transport buses yes and certainly taxis everywhere yes, what evidence do you have for that the surgeon general's report has proven it but let's talk no not that smoking causes cancer the time, the surgeon general's report reviewed scientific literature done by other bodies much the same way that same body of scientific literature has been reviewed before three international conferences reviewing the same body of scientific research said that that's not the case the surgeon general's own report in reviewing the cancer link so to speak so that less than half of the studies came to the conclusion that yet the Surgeon General was staying on soldiers come to the conclusion, that we should ban smoking on airlines the Surgeon General never testified on this Airship so he didn't testify but he is declared in statements that he calls for a band where you can get fans,get fans due to the rapid diffusion of tobacco smoke he just can't separate people on an airplane the tobacco smoke doesn't know where this, isolated separate compartments on airlines would you allow smoking in the smoking-compartment would I like I can't range not if my wife had to work in the area she was a flight attendant you would depend on the attendance health hazard as Paramount that really the patties what is going to be a catalytic Factor we haven't even discussed safety oxygen Michelle tonight and we'll explore other alternatives to this ban on all smoking on airline flights, Konica Duff kaneko's Royal come here's the answer for tough customers a full line of copiers that have proven themselves Top Fin businesses from coast to coast copiers back by, if sales and service that says tough as it is response and that's not just tough that's tough to beat, if you'll roll guess it's powerful chlorine release system deodorizers and fite stain build up so you won't have to clean as often as Santa flush it takes the Beast out of your bowl, the world the hijackers claiming to be Palestinians, these are just two of the three million Afghans who have fled from Soviet Devastation I'm Raymond Burr speaking for the International Rescue committee helping those refugees to rebuild their shattered lives but Afghans are not the only uprooted victims of persecution and Terror there are so many more counting on IRC to help IRC depends on the American Spirit of giving refugees hope for the future we're counting on you II see Bob 16 New York New York 100 36 thanks, you,welcome back to Crossfire Saturday we're discussing the question of cigarette smoking on commercial airline flights should it be banned or is that an imposition on the rights of tobacco smokers our guests are Brennan Moran of the tobacco Institute and are on Lightman the president of citizens against tobacco smoke or cats mr. Lightman what happens if President Reagan vetoes the bill the big Transportation bill that the smoking ban is included in, you have to then start from scratch not start from scratch I think it will create a sense of public outrage in this nation we know what public opinion is on this issue overwhelmingly in favor of a band we are looking forward to presenting testimony at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing that will occur within the next few months on Senator hatch's Bill 51 Senate Bill 51 which will ban smoking in all forms of public transportation and restrictive to designated areas inside terminals that will take care of this notation, and working on this measure anyway we are marking with forward straight ahead let me try a couple of the other claims that the opponents of tobacco smoking on airliners have made they said it causes the retardation of lung development among children now what evidence do you have for that did involuntarily ingesting smoke by children because their lungs not to develop children who live with people who smoke and who were subjected to have impaired lung function I'm also concerned about the, a safety issue that showing on airlines not talking about children who were exposed to the they are harmed there's no doubt about it I don't know why you don't want to admit it but I take my kids on bikes and we sit in a non-smoking section they've never complained they don't say those horrible smokers in the back I wish they view in other words this is not a classic ideological left-right issue since, other deukmejian a prominent Republican California signed a bill Banning smoking in trust State and Senator hatch for example and Bob Dornan who some people in crossfire remember is for van right totally yes maybe I could be aligned yourself with let me ask you a question about tobacco Institute is so excited about this issue that is the costs so what someone doesn't smoke for 90 minutes they'll live fact a live longer if they don't smoke but why do you care that, much since obviously 99.99% of the time someone may smoke there on the ground and it's very infrequently that their on-air how does it cost you it costs us in a lot of different ways the tobacco industry fights and fights very hard at all levels of government to get rid of or to stop government intrusion into these areas where Common Sense situations are already in place where employers where restaurant owners where Airlines were already doing things that accommodate, dude that's majority of the public and that's what public opinion on this issue sub time and time and time again was that the separation of smokers and non-smokers on all flights whether they were 90 or 91 minutes was working well gee I read in the Wall Street Journal that the American Medical Association did a poll and the a Mac I quote everybody all the way from A to B so that 83 percent of doctors favored a band because of health effects 67% of the public favor to ban yes, between 80 and 85 percent the public saying they were sad angry, is the surgeon general's insistence that there be consumer warnings on cigarette snow in my reading am I going back several decades now and then looking at the testimony given I wasn't with the tobacco industry them there was an article you would favor because it gets you out of liability suit one point on public opinion on October 7th before a house Aviation subcommittee hearing the international airline passengers Association released a poll which did make news eighty-three percent of the people on planes don't smoke an overwhelming majority want a, boban the reason for the tobacco companies concern is clear Mark cigarette companies sell cigarettes by convincing people that smoking will help people gain social acceptability but Along Comes A study that says tobacco smoke contaminates and pollutes the air causes harm to innocent people and Presto people don't want to smoke anymore they realize that it harms other pieces of typical anti-smoking reaction trying to make social smoking socially unacceptable trying to legislate a smoke free Society by the year 2000 and where we, we are winning make the tobacco companies look unreasonable well tobacco Institute is looking for reasonable accommodation is those smokers and non-smokers we're not looking for small talk about some of those reasonable accommodations why not have a system of well why not first go in and get the ventilator the ventilation system on planes improved if that's the problem well I know it's really the Naas looked into that need is virtually impossible unless you eliminate the source of the carcinogenic ventilation, how do you feel as an air traveler okay you're there with your family do you know that oxygen masks and ground tests fail to drop because they're mating surfaces are glued shut from tobacco tars out for vowels malfunction you know this is Halloween this is not trick or treat this was given to me by an airline right Clapton it is a great crop half this is tobacco tar that does cause, malfunction of the outflow valve and this is a part of the waste product I don't from somebody's addiction to I feel no health hazard whatsoever, the financial weight of the tobacco Institute on this issue do you know how much money you all spent in PAC contributions or what's called honoraria or dishonor area money for speeches to members in their purse for the personal income we have the same filings is everyone else know the bottom line like I did right now neither can I neither can I, and sometimes you win and sometimes you lose, just putting in the political system the same way other corporations and interest groups do that we can provide information others try to your point of view against Banning smoking on airlines what you're taking smoking as a broad issue out there excise taxes they're smoking restrictions, you as a congressman, yes I do totally going on up on all the real problem on Airlines and see if you want to ban this to now the one problem I've seen doesn't come from smokes growing up in my non-smoking section but from people drinking too much on planes getting rowdy yelling the making a hard time for affect other people when they get Rowdy involuntary drinking is not the same as involuntary come on now you know what I'm talking about because the airline's give them alcohol, they get Rowdy they wander up and down the plane they yell I don't see much of that I don't see much of that at all thank you Fred and I will be back in a moment for a moment, One By One

and I emphasize so called involuntary smoking these people who want to ban smoking on all flights don't want to wait around for the real studies the end flight testing to be done rather afraid of people enrolled meddling and trying to impose their preferences or involuntary passengers I should be good enough for me and you and if smokers abstain, for an hour-and-a-half movie why not an hour

fhhb0039,"hello Doug this is Sarah McClurkin I think it's time to do the program we talked about you know the one about the cigarette advertising and promotion code, that's right, why don't you pull your crew together and meet with me to map this out, hm, Thursday 10 a.m. that's fine with me good I'll see you then bye, I'm glad you could all make it today we need to find a way to present, the cigarette advertising and promotion code to a very broad audience you know brand marketing field marketing ad agencies sampling contractors right that is everybody that's involved with the creation and execution of cigarette advertising and promotion now I have read this code and I think it's a pretty tough subject to cover because it is so very comprehensive and covers a advertising point of sale promotion materials sampling practices, right it is comprehensive and the codes been updated so it's important that everyone know the new ground rules and that everyone realized the code is a set of guidelines that govern the way we want and intend to do business so what you're saying is the code isn't something we're trying to beat it's really a set of standards that our industry wants to meet that's right so how do we get that point across well first we need to give some background like the fact that the tobacco industry has had a, Terry advertising code since 1964 but I think that we need to go beyond that and we'll talk about why we even have a code and what the code is trying to do we also need to tell people about some important changes in the code like not advertising cigarettes on Billboard's within 500 feet of schools and playgrounds and I think that's a good example of what the code tries to do we don't want children to smoke we don't want to ask for their present in large numbers and to make sure that we're not appealing, children the code now says that we will not mail cigarette samples or cigarette logoed premium items to anyone who hasn't signed a written certification that day already smoked and that they're at least 21 years old and there are a lot of other rules about sampling and direct marketing right for instance we can't give out samples on public streets sidewalks or Parks unless it's an area that's only open to people who can legally buy cigarettes our, this is to rope off an area and restricted mission to those who are 21 or older isn't there also something about people phoning in for cigarettes samples yes there sure is the code says we cannot distribute them that way now I know that this stuff is important but these guidelines are complex and detailed Now isn't there something that we can do to make sure that our people and our suppliers get the point hey how about shooting a video tape we could start with a roleplay to show the steps we go through, to qualify smokers hi hi therefore my shirt are you a smoker yeah are you over 21 years of age may I please see some identification, I hope you enjoy your shirt thanks sure thanks yeah I can really see that working but we need to make the point that we only give away clothing in adult sizes and we interpret that to mean adult size large and extra-large not adult small or medium well you just did so I did, good job okay okay we've covered qualifying smokers by age now what else do we need to talk about I think we need to talk about the claims that we pay to put products and cigarette ads in popular movies mmm-hmm we don't and I think people need to know that that's covered in the code and they need to know that the code spells out some very specific guidelines that govern how we develop cigarette ads well take this ad for example these models are at least, 25 and they have to look at least that old the code says we can show anyone who is well-known as an athlete as a smoker and we can't use testimonials from sports figures or celebrities or actually from anyone else who has a special appeal to anyone who's under 21 when are these people all look healthy and attractive does that violate the code no that's fine it's okay just as long as there's no suggestion that they look good or they're healthy because they, smoke what about ads to show people ceiling bowling or doing some other physical activity no problem that is fine too as long as it's an activity that doesn't require athletic abilities or special stamina that would be beyond what you need for normal Recreation you know you wouldn't want to show a marathon runner standing at a Finish Line having a smoke now this is all serious stuff now is there something we can do to lighten it up sure let's talk about sex, sewer six in advertising it's a major claim against cigarette companies Yeah the code deals with that too in fact it says let me quote cigarette advertising shall not suggest that smoking is essential to social prominence distinction success or sexual attraction nor shall it picture a person smoking in an exaggerated manner so what you're saying is our ads Cannon, apply that smoking a cigarette will make you rich or famous or help you get a date that's right and we need to make those points you know the code isn't very long but it contains a lot of detailed information well never be able to get all of that into the video well we don't have to video is just one way that we let people know we have a set of standards that we follow and then we've changed our code made it stronger yeah, there is one more point we need to make about advertising though cigarette ads cannot appear in Publications directed primarily to those who are under 21 years of age like teen and write on or young Miss and this also includes school college and university media well hold on Sarah I'm confused don't a lot of people over 21 attend colleges and universities yes that's a good point but the code prohibits this type of, start izing because College Publications are likely to be read by people under 21 let's go back to sampling do we need to cover it in detail no we don't our company already has a videotape called sampling our way in fact I brought a copy of it let me show you a clip great, tell me Paul what's the most important thing a sampler has to do all procedures important and must be followed but screen is probably the most important procedure anyone who has given a cigarette sample must be screened as a smoker 21 or old how does the sampler find this out by asking screening questions we always ask hi are you a smoker and even if they're smoking when they come up to us we still ask we only give samples smokers and only two people 21 and older do you always ask their age to experiences, taught us that some older people resent being asked their age so if the smokers obviously over 30 we give them the authorized number of samples hi are you a smoker yes I am enjoy your camel thank you if the smoker is not obviously over 30 we asked what date were you born the date that qualifies a smoker is being 21 years of age or older will always be provided by the market manager Sarah who sees that video well we show it to all of our sampling contractors and their employees, he's well it looks like we have enough to do a video where we go from here how about lunch on you of course okay, you all have copies of the code and you can see that the rules are pretty straightforward but there are a couple of points that I would like to make first why do we even have a code because our industry is interested in making sure that we're marketing our products in a legal and ethical manner we're not interested in trying to appeal to anyone who doesn't already smoked and we're not interested in marketing our products to anyone who's under age, there are 15 million American adults who already choose to smoke if we get more than our current chair of those smokers we're doing our jobs the code helps us effectively Market our products to those smokers without appealing to these other groups are there any questions, what's this in a code regarding certifications do we really get them the Code provides that we will not send samples or promotional items bearing our brand logos through the mail except the persons who are first provided us with sign certifications that they are 21 or older that they are a smoker and that they want to receive the samples or premiums we get these certifications from everyone before we send them samples or premiums in fact we had implemented this as, company practice well before it came out as part of the industry code why well we did it because we don't want to be communicating with children or with non-smokers or with people who don't want to sending them things it wastes our time and our promotional dollars the certification practice is a reasonable step to avoid communicating with inappropriate persons, and except for liars and cheaters it is effective who judges whether a model in an ad looks to be at least 25 years old that's a tough one our code provides that model shall not be under 25 years of age or look under 25 as I get older and older everyone else looks younger and younger all right seriously the age that someone looks really is a matter of judgment we're not trying to appeal to children, Ian, if as some people claim people find the most appealing models to be ones that are their own age 25 builds in a real safety net against the possibility that our advertising will appeal to a child, if we've done an honest job and attempting to meet this requirement I'm satisfied to let those who oppose us take their potshots the law department has a reputation of being pretty tough on this one and it is on our list of things that we consciously check in every ad if I think that a competitor is violating the code what should I do first of all we don't find very much of this going on our competition is just as committed as we are to advertising and promoting their products to smokers, so in a responsible way in a very real way all of our futures depend on it, if you spot what you think is a violation give the Law Department a call if we agree that it's a potential violation will call the other companies Law Department and let them know, we assume that Having learned of a potential violation they'll do what we would do move quickly and effectively to check the facts and if remedial action is necessary take it but don't make the mistake that some of our critics do in an effort to hamper our competition don't read more into the code than is there it's already a pretty tough document, any other questions, well okay, as I think you can see is one of the characters in The videotape said the code isn't a set of rules that we're trying to beat it's a set of standards that our company and our industry want to meet so familiarize yourself with the code and when you're developing advertising promotions sampling or special events look to the code first and let those standards be your guide",0.8520504913513514,0.54772365,0.9128392

of them or some of the Retailer's eyewitness news reporter glycol Jones joins us now with more on this plan to crack down on the handle well and you've probably seen me sign that convenience stores or even grosser everybody's got to take responsibility for this we're stepping up to the plate and taking responsibility with we card, but it's important that I think we create awareness that this isn't just a retail problem we're going to take the initial steps but it's everybody's problem and we need to deal with it the Indiana Coalition for responsible tobacco retailing has come up with a program to prevent tobacco sales to minors retailers will check the ID of individuals appearing to be under the age of 18 if they attempt to buy tobacco products Kentucky retailers are ready to get tough on teen smokers about 40 retailers attended a training session on how to, say no to minors trying to buy cigarettes a new outdoor campaign to stop the sale of tobacco to children and teenagers is up and running in Louisville it is called week hired if you're under 18 and smoke retailers are warning you they won't sell you cigarettes retailers are letting teens know in a big way they won't break the law the Kentucky Coalition for responsible tobacco retailing unveiled this billboard this morning now a new national campaign is cracking down on sales to minors it began today in San Francisco, and Channel 7's Heather issue Morrow joins us with details Heather World an anywhere you can buy cigarettes you're going to start seeing these we card signs it's part of a national campaign to try to stop teen smoking mostly by educating the clerks who sell the tobacco over the counter-isil campaign to stop the sale of tobacco to minors was launched in Santa Barbara this morning Martha bull joins us now live with more on this Innovative program Martha that's right Debbie's a weak card program is the newest tool for retailers in their fight against selling tobacco, products to minors the goal is to educate every store owner to teach their employees and inform their customers about the tobacco sales laws, received in Nevada a tremendous response are we've done a lot of initiatives here both with the mailing to retailers initially now following up with this we've also contacted vending machine distributors throughout the state asking for decals there and certainly we expect that the decal program and this educational program will go a long ways in this regard I think that Nevada has really stepped up to the plate, plate and we're proud to participate in this program today with you all I do think though it's a very collaborative and Cooperative effort and education is at the heart of all of this despite the short period of time the we card program has been in effect in New York state I think we have seen already enormous results we conducted a survey of retailers across the state and that survey revealed that 35% of all retailers were selling tobacco products to young people but those that were participating in the week our program only, percent that's a substantial reduction I think it's an important ingredient directly attributable to the week I program I think the way card program is great it's great that the retailers and the Grocer's and all of the people who are on the front lines and and having to comply with the law have the incentive and willingness the responsibility to work with us and all of those in law enforcement to comply with the law and to get the word out teen smoking nationally it's on the rise but it can, Taki program called we card is fighting teen smoking by keeping young people from buying tobacco products Jack Williams was in Frankfurt tonight where people in the fight against teen smoking say we card is working it's looking better for the kids in the state of Kentucky and I mean that's the focus we're Johnstone Commissioner of Kentucky's Department of Alcohol Beverage Control says the program is working people really are paying attention to it retailers specifically I am pleased to support the coalition's we card effort I think it is, important step forward in this program we are all working together to make sure that the state law is enforced retailers are the first defense against kids buying cigarettes there's come into the store and wants to buy they're the ones who are there every day every minute and can catch them if you will by demanding their identification card a recent study found 70 percent of retailers sold tobacco products to minors in 1996 but in the, first month of 1997 the table's turned with only 30 percent selling to minors we believe that this turnaround is due to Greater Merchant awareness with the law, we believe that is also due to programs like we card, the Coalition for responsible tobacco retail ings we card program a sensible Solution that's getting positive results in preventing underage tobacco sales",0.8540064930769231,0.75845635,0.9128386

Nabisco company is lying or the tens of thousands of children who were surveyed for these studies aligned and people have to decide which is which RJ Reynolds adamantly says it does not advertised to kids or Recruit new smokers RJR Nabisco and the other cigarette companies say the only purpose of their advertising is to encourage brand switching we call that the BS Theory and we don't believe it

industry and she is in our Washington Bureau also with us is Joe tie president of stop teenage addiction to tobacco and he is in Springfield Massachusetts welcome to you both Miss Dawson let me begin with you in the question of the day do tobacco companies Target our teenagers absolutely not and in your setup Pacer it gave a number of very bad Impressions first of all let's set the stage if we look at how many teenagers smoke the Centers for Disease Control recently reported, that between the ages of 12 and 18 in the last week just a little bit better than 10% of those youngsters had smoked so youngsters are much more likely not to smoke than to smoke at all but tobacco commonly guys I'm pleased to say that the figures are holding steady well they are holding steady after a very dramatic decline in the late 1970s through the 1980s but tobacco companies think that even that number that 10% in the last week is too high and that's why we've taken a, number of very positive steps to keep kids from smoking if we look at the latest study on teenage smoking published it comes from the American Journal of Public Health that study says that the best way to keep kids from smoking is to give them a tools that they need to reduce peer pressure and in fact the tobacco industry has an active program nationally advertised to give parents those tools for their children we also have programs with retailers so that the kind of thing you saw where a young person is able to go in and purchase cigarettes, illegally in any retail store can be curtailed we go out and we Robbie to raise the age limit in states where 18 isn't the age but let's talk to us a little bit about the advertising specifically she work what what does it say to you about the appeal of the advertising campaign if more kids are recognizing oh Joe Camel than adults well you also found in that study of one thing that the anti smokers won't tell you is that more kids recognize Chevrolet and Ford which certainly aren't childlike products for three to six year old been, just rode a camel that twice as many recognize Chevrolet is recognized Marlborough talking about cars and kids aren't buying cars but kids do recognize things that are advertised to adults you can't reduce Society to the level of a Sandbox Manti smokers would have you believe that if the camel ads were any kind of cigarette ads were removed that somehow kids wouldn't know about cigarettes anymore and that's not the case teenage smoking continues to decline we think that working together we should be able to push it further but reducing ads as, as shown by the World Experience simply isn't going to get you there but I didn't ask you specifically about reducing enzyme talking about the type of advertising do you agree that old Joe Camel is a cartoon I think he has a car he is a cartoon do you also agree that cartoons appeal to children not necessarily you can look at the Jolly Green Giant kids aren't vegetable favorites first of all you can look at the Pink Panther selling insulation not a children's product you can go on and on downloads I'm not sure Walt Disney would, be with you but let's move to Jojo tie you've heard what she's had to say what do you think of it well I think she's not telling the truth first of all teenage smoking did decline in the late 70s and then it has stayed flat throughout the 80s the reason I think because the amount of money spent by the cigarette companies to promote smoking tripled over that time period now there are four recent studies that show cigarette smoking went up between 1987 and the present including the Center for Disease Control ongoing study that, shows that last year teenage smoking actually went up she's not telling the truth about that she's also not telling the truth about the study when she says it more kids recognized Chevrolet than camel that's not true more children recognize camel than almost any other logo with the exception of Walt Disney's logo and they're they're almost identical now once you have and I have the charts right in front of me in the JAMA articles what you have is a higher recognition between those three and six year olds that were looked at, that Ford and Chevrolet than of camel but you want to talk about camel recognition because your agenda is to ban advertising and the only thing you can show is that kids see cigarette ads well that's not a surprise to anyone but that doesn't translate and you haven't made the point that kids are buying more cigarettes and the CDC studies do not show that till everything is on I do have statistics that would show that even though camo is not targeting teens as you say that they have been able to increase, their percentage of the teenage underage Market from a half percent to 33 percent so obviously somebody's getting the message and you also had a representative of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company saying that they can show where their sales are and that the average age of a camel smoker is 35 years old so that's just these numbers are being set out by anti-smoking activists they are not demonstrated in the federal literature which reviews who's smoking and how much they're not demonstrated by the sales, the tobacco companies we surely know how much money they're making and how many cigarettes they're selling wait a minute the people from The Tobacco companies consistently tell the Press they deliberately do not try to study the child market now you're trying to tell us that they do what's the truth the truth is that you need cigarette companies are trying to encourage children to smoke with cartoon characters with sports themes many of these ads violate your own code of advertising ethics the tobacco industry says we have a code of, sizing ethics that prohibits many of the athletic and success-oriented ads that are used to try and encourage children to smell let me get back in here for a minute Miss Dawson do you want teenagers to smoke yes or no absolutely not 18 do you want them to smoke then it is up to them to make their own decision about whether or not they want to be a smoker your campaigns are truly affected you'll make your own business obsolete no because in fact many people start to smoke after the age of 18 and it's up to them at that point before that it is illegal, Eagle it is wrong it shouldn't have actually three out of four according to the CDC begin before the age of 18 according to a federal study that was published in February of 1990 more than half of current smokers started after the age of 18 even if the TAF it's quite a few Miss Dawson thank you very much and mr. Tai same to you thank you one way to stop teen smoking is to take cigarettes away from teenage you can do that by getting tough with Merchants who sell them to young people it's working in Illinois

any Orville Redenbacher's product will make a donation to the US volleyball team is a go for the gold and Barcelona takes a lot of dedication be the best as Grandpa always says do one thing and do it better than anyone, we're back now and how can you keep kids away from cigarettes is education enough or are new laws necessary with us now or Sergeant Bruce Talbot from Woodbridge Illinois police department and jolly and Davidson an education consultant for the tobacco industry but welcome thank you initially Miss Dawson said that the record industry was taking steps to keep kids from smoking one of them is a program called Helping youth say no it was introduced last year, or what's the point of that program correct it's an educational program for parents the book is designed to backhoe helping youth saying no is designed to help their parents work with their young people in coping with peer pressure because peer pressure is the number one reason why kids try smoking and parents need to be involved they need to work with their youngsters kids need to understand what peer pressure is all about the booklet the second part of the book that helps parents actually it gives them techniques in that they, use to help their youngsters say no to tobacco and a number of other activities they don't want them involved in I have gone through the book many pretty pictures not one picture of a cigarette not one picture of a damaged or diseased lung not one mention of health risks not one mention of cancer it does mention the health risks in that the Surgeon General has said the former Surgeon General had certainly said that all youngsters are well aware of the health claims we recognize that the, or she mm that developed the booklet a group of educational individuals people that have worked with not only children but with parents and attorney that works with Juvenile Justice a number of individuals across the country all of us made the decision that this booklet was important in that it helped youngsters or helped parents work with their youngsters to cope with a peer pressure they have the health information of the another most effective tool well obviously faith in it hasn't proven to be the most, most effective tool because the school's today both public and private have done a far better job with Comprehensive Health education than ever before the kids have the facts what they don't have and what we need to give them is the maturity to make good decisions on these tough issues you have a 16 year old granddaughter grandson something right if he walked into you and said I'm going to start smoking what would you say to him well I'd sit down with him and first of all I'd ask him why I think too many times as parents we do, don't we don't try to find out why the youngster actually wants to do it he probably would come back as most youngsters do and say well all my friends are doing it then we need to sit down and as we would discuss any decision-making we need to talk about Gathering all the information and parents will handle that differently some of them will bring in some information from one Health Organization or perhaps about a program like the policemen here is is advocating and is working very well in Illinois I understand and then you need, talk about the alternative hands talk about the consequences you need to talk about the health risks parents will handle it differently but it's important that we communicate we need to work together Sergeant Talbert is that kind of an approach going to work after doing a three-year drug prevention program in our community full-time what I've learned from our children in Woodridge IL Illinois is that they start smoking not from peer pressure but from industry advertising and let me to explain why I, believe that the industry spends each and every day six million dollars on Advertising if you do a program like this and sit down and talk to your children once or twice a year about smoking every day that the industry pores those millions of dollars in has a greater effect if Peer Pressure was responsible for analysts and smoking there would be no adolescent smoking because 81 percent of high school seniors don't smoke the peer pressure, is against smoking the child that I see in our community who is a young 13 or 14 year old smoker is influenced by media advertising because his own self-esteem is so low is self-concept is so low his peer group identification is broken his school performances broken they use tobacco advertising to prop up their personality to prop up their self-esteem what did you do in Woodridge to, combat the problem you actually legislated it yes we had an instance were 13 and 14 year olds were buying

make those guys stop selling to these children but what we ended up doing when we found that a warning letter from the police department resulted in only an 83 percent sales rates to 13 year old children I wrote a tobacco license law, it really mirrors our liquor license law and it's different from most vehicle license laws in that when we catch you selling to underage minors we suspend your privilege to sell tobacco to anyone it much anyway that we suspend a driver's license when you get three moving versus a that program were implemented nationally the program exists not that exact program but in practically every state there is a law that is there's no enforcement well but that's the problem, awesome and they do need to enforce and I think that's fine in my home state of Iowa

right now the August Bowser Junior High School is holding an anti-smoking rally and let's meet teen rap singers Ricardo Ruiz and soon D tirado hi guys how you doing is it tough to convince other kids not to smoke yeah some kids want to listen and some don't yeah because you know it's sometimes hard but there's a lot of kids out there who listen to us and get the message that we try to get over that we try to portray to our wraps and talking and, stuff like that let's hear one of the wraps that you use to try to get that message out and show us a little right okay, hi what's up is this lime one is it a spicy with Coach a shot we about to kick some funky lyrics on Smokey take us out real fast there we go all right smoking a disease that can bring death are you fooled by this step you can

Legit to Quit now let's meet the guy who organized today's assembly David Altman is a professor at Stanford and you were behind all of this how tough is it to get kids to really hear what those rappers are saying we found in the city of San Jose that the teenagers really, see through the tactics of the tobacco industry groups like you've seen here today and throughout the city are mounting campaigns throughout San Jose to counter the damaging effects of the tobacco industry we have wraps going on we have counter advertising campaigns some groups have mounted petition drives to get teachers and administrators in their schools not to be allowed to smoke cigarettes and the like so we're really optimistic about the roll, that young people can play in the Tobacco Control effort because I would guess that hearing it from their peers means more, that's true I think peers listen to one another you can see in the audience today that we have a couple hundred kids that are I think

Gary Burger senior vice president of RJ Reynolds tobacco company's research and development department our challenge is to provide the company with a knowledge and tools to remain ahead of the competition we are committed to this task and take great pride in meeting the challenges of tomorrow today pride and progress is a long-standing tradition here at RJ r--, tobacco blind studies that led to Camel cigarettes in 1913 to the introduction of cellophane wrappers in 1931 our company's early successes as an industry leader are Steep and directed research leading to technological achievement in the 1950s Rd developed the first nationally successful filter tips cigarettes Winston and Salem which remain among the nation's top selling cigarette brands we also developed the first, the cigarette that primarily Heats rather than Burns tobacco and we have been consistently in the Forefront of innovation by developing processes needed to introduce lotar Brands and to fully utilize tobacco byproducts RJ Reynolds tobacco has a distinguished record as a company that takes pride in progress and carrying on that tradition today our research and development efforts focus on three main areas first we continuously evaluate, evaluate existing products to improve them or just as important to reduce production costs without compromising product quality second we constantly refine our production processes to keep Pace with the evolving Marketplace and our expanding knowledge base finally we develop new products to meet the ever-changing desires of smokers, our research is vital to maintaining the hundreds of RJR brand Styles marketed in the US and in over 160 countries worldwide let's take a closer look at how the research and development team keeps r.j. Reynolds on The Cutting Edge our technology is dedicated to evaluating our Jr.'s existing cigarette brands several teams including brands are D International Brands product evaluation and sensory product development play a key role in this effort, the Brand's team maintains and improves our current Brands and develops new brand Styles we evaluate and develop materials for our established domestic and Export Brands and ensure they meet RJ are strict requirements for quality and cost, flavor compounds are developed and evaluated to understand how they contribute to each Brands unique taste profile as well as how these flavors interact with tobacco, our research on the tobacco leaf and controlled growing environment is also vital to improving existing products we evaluate the companies Leaf purchase and blending programs and work to improve current products through new filter and fine papers technology the biological chemical and behavioral research efforts of our product evaluation group have made RJ are the leading Authority on Tobacco and tobacco products, in addition our comparative toxicologists investigate the effect of tobacco products and mainstream and environmental tobacco smoke constituents down to the cellular and molecular level health and environmental Sciences uses these and other data to ensure Regulatory Compliance For Occupational Health and environmental practices this includes monitoring current product appropriate use of agricultural chemicals, valuation of the effect of new ingredients and processes on products under development as well as review of scientific literature and when appropriate provide responses to such literature we are also interested in learning more about how and why people smoke to better understand our customers and our Products Research in this and other areas has resulted in the publication of hundreds of articles in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, sensory product development carries our research on consumer response to another level by soliciting smoker reactions regarding the taste and acceptability of our current Brands competitors products and new product prototypes are Jr is able to stay in close touch with the marketplace, our scientists have also studied the chemical properties and biological effects of nicotine publication of their findings in the peer-reviewed scientific literature has added to the body of evidence that nicotine and similar compounds may have therapeutic potential for treating certain neurological diseases such as Parkinson's, our and he's continued evaluation and Improvement efforts keep RJ are at the Forefront of our industry in order to maintain our leadership role however we must continually improve our production processes to stay a step ahead of our competition that's where the process technology and Development Group comes in RJ r-- competes in a rapidly evolving technological environment and does not have the luxury of using off-the-shelf methods of Process Measurement and control when emerging, his demand new measurement and control systems it is our job to create them for example we pioneered a device for measuring sugar levels in the tobacco leaf extensive equipment modifications are sometimes necessary as evidenced by the requirements needed to produce a cigarette that primarily Heats rather than Burns tobacco the achievements of this team range from improving manufacturing productivity to decreasing costs by reducing waste, both are crucial in keeping our Jr.'s brands cost-effective in addition to evaluating and improving existing products and processes Rd is a launching pad for new products the two teams primarily responsible for developing new products or product development and the cigarette technology groups, our product development team investigate specific elements and properties of cigarettes that are important in designing products still on the horizon this includes everything from Research into tobacco blending and flavoring to development of cigarette filter systems these efforts are supported by a full-service state-of-the-art analytical laboratory for determining composition of both tobacco and smoke product development is just one of the areas in, Rd which generates ideas for tomorrow's Technologies the new cigarette Technology Group focuses on emerging brands that have been targeted for development the materials that go into these new products are evaluated for basic chemical composition and physical characteristics tobacco Blends and flavor formulations are developed and evaluated to determine the optimum mix for enhancing taste, our researchers also evaluate the products aerosol characteristics as well as physical properties such as weight circumference and light ability given our continued investments in people facilities and Equipment directed toward developing new and better products and processes are Jr is well-positioned to maintain its technological leadership of the tobacco industry we're proud of the fact that our Jr.'s research and development department has a record of, achievement second to none in a rapidly evolving industry

flwk0146,"can you believe the month of June is OV ER it's a four-letter word that's right so it's ju well, oh why good morning everyone well cigarette smoking has come under attack from doctors lawmakers and non-smokers now that tobacco industry is waging a counter-attack with a series of ads calling attention to the economic cloud of smokers in just a couple minutes one of the industry's top spokesman is going to be joining us to tell us about that war that they're fighting Philip Morris one of America's largest tobacco companies has launched a multi-million dollar ad campaign to emphasize the economic climate, out of smokers the first ads appeared this week in nineteen daily newspapers and they go into 32 National magazines over the next six months Big Stuff joining us is Philip Morris's vice-president for corporate Affairs and publisher of Philip Morris's magazine guy Smith good morning good morning I saw those ads this week in the paper and I said the cigarette companies are finally saying were mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore well we're not mad we just, really just you're not mad right we just want to make sure that are 60 million customers aren't ignored there's 60 million people in this country that smoke live enjoy our product that want it and what's happened in this country is that is that some people in the anti-smoking movement are attempting to make smokers social pariahs and what it is is that smokers contribute economically, culturally socially in an enormous way to the US economy in this country the ad that I saw in the paper said if smokers were a country that have a gross national product of a trillion dollars through it and I was sitting there I said am I supposed to be intimidated by that or I hope not I hope not but no don't be intimidated but if you're an entrepreneur or you're in business it's a missed Economic Opportunity to ignore smokers, you don't really know your way to say you'd better keep that smoking section open in the restaurant you'd better not support stop smoking laws because we've got a lot of money we've got a lot of cloud and we're not going to get pushed around it's not Philip Morris it has Cloud it's the economic force of smokers and think about the restaurant owner I think a restaurant owner if he wants a ban smoking he ought to ban it but not have the government do it what's the rest, owners should be able to do is take care of his clientele and if he wants to have a smoking section for smokers and a non-smoking section 4 is non-smokers he certainly should be able to do that but don't have the Congress or some city council's that you have to do this let him let the free market enterprise system work that there's some pretty daunting numbers in the in the in the ads we might be able to throw one or two of them up right here where did the numbers come from where to where do your statistics come from statistics in, the advertising come from the Roper organization that's burns Roper he's one of the preeminent pollsters and public opinion experts on had they didn't come from the the survey that you did in your own mango know the magazine survey which ran in the winter issue of Philip Morris magazine was a survey of our readers about three-quarters of whom are smokers and a quarter are non-smokers but the only the Roper independent data is what's reflected in, Evert okay this is this is the Philip Morris magazine and I just became aware of it this this past winter you what is not be a smoker what used to be a smoker what's the circulation on this thing that circulation was the summer issue which is on the presses right now is 11.2 million which makes it how big a magazine fifth largest magazine in the country and this is really a way I mean they're all kinds of things in here but the middle of it is the added you are editorial spin right that's right if we can't get it in a, in the Free Press well we'll do our own thing right that's free press yeah well as it is that's right it is free and that's right what we like to say that it presents a less well heard point of view on all kinds of issues relating to smoking less Lawler Brokers what was your reaction this week Canada pest sweeping sweeping legislation in a ban all cigarette advertising going to ban cigarette advertising sponsorship of cultural and sporting events all cigarette packages now have to come with, pamphlets that detail the hazards of smoking if it can happen in Canada certainly can it happen in the United States no and my reaction is thank God for the first amendment that Canada is a wonderful country but they don't have a tradition of the First Amendment the first amendment in this country says you can't be a sensor the government can't censor free speech Just because somebody doesn't want to hear the speech doesn't mean that it's the right thing to do, and what happens to see the problem is the anti smokers say well we're going to ban advertising because it's going to reduce consumption but in countries around the world where that's happened and they're 16 in the country in the world where there's no advertising eight of them in the Eastern Bloc countries where there's no advertising at all but eight other countries consumption is up of tobacco so it isn't going to solve that purpose and what it's going to do is restrict Free Speech all right guys Smith from Philip, Morris thanks for coming in this morning smokers are fighting back to know they used to be an ad like that with the pension and not our brand

fmpj0015,"okay, it's very important that our people disco and our people in the back of company gets now to start running if it's, finished with annual meeting for this year obviously I'm very pleased with the result of the voting as you all know now on very preliminary vote counts the LeBeau Brooks late was, did in I'm not a political expert but from my point of view it's a landslide I think it's the vote was well from what I understand it was at least three or three and a half times to one against le beau and my guess is that if you took out his and icon shares is vote as Tiny indeed probably my guess is eight to one or maybe even, in 21 against his slate so what I see in this is that our shareholders were listening to what we had to say and our shareholders understood that we were listening to them and that's the important thing because what I think our shareholders recognize is this is a fantastic company with great Brands tremendous Brands internationally and domestically both in the tobacco side and the food side they see the value in the company, and they want their management to get back to work and get performance out of this company and that's what we're going to do now that this distraction is behind us so with that said it's just that simple really let me take some questions, yes sir spinoff is something that is going to stay a front-burner issue for our board it's an important priority for us but the key thing is we're not going to do something to injure the whole company in trying to do something that today would be unwise more importantly for us right now is to concentrate, straight on our businesses 1995 and the last part of the year we started to get good performance out of our Reynolds tobacco company which is located here in Winston-Salem we're going to have a terrific year in our tobacco business in 1996 Reynolds tobacco here in Winston-Salem is going to do well and our international business is going to be performing in double digits in 1996 now we're just going to have to, let events unfold, I think our shareholders have really had a full analysis on the spin-off they've been through this they've been listening to it now for eight months as you're aware our shareholders not only resoundingly rejected messrs icon and labo but they also rejected these shareholder proposal on a spin-off and what they're telling us is very clear get the value for us that's, Aunt in the wonderful Brands you have at Reynolds tobacco and at Nabisco and that's what they want us to do now and that's what our management is going to focus on yes sir yes I think what our tobacco company has said publicly and I think what Philip Morris and the others have said is is we're not going to settle those cases we're confident we're going to Prevail in those, cases and that's how we feel right now my own view is I wasn't at the castano hearings but I read in the Wall Street Journal and the other papers what you all have read and I think that tobacco Industries defenses are very strong very strong year for earnings Lieutenant Colonel speaking census figures are too low now I think I think we are job this year is to meet walls, Street expectations and we expect to do that and we also expect to be investing in our tobacco business and in Nabisco now that our balance sheet has been strengthened and that's what I talked about at the annual meeting today how important 1995 was again keep in mind this is a company that had 30 billion dollars of debt just a few years ago and now on an RN Standalone basis we've got that balance sheet down to where our debt is completely manageable and we can now focus on, getting our businesses that's what 1996 is going to be yes sir well I think you can look right now at Reynolds tobacco and see the job that they're doing with their full share Brands and see that they are on the way back I don't know if any of you saw the in the other day in the Wall Street Journal the article on our new red camel and our leverage how we're leveraging our camel Brands I think the company is doing an excellent job, job there you've seen the articles about eclipses are Reynolds tobacco company today is a company with a commitment to grow its earnings it's got new ideas Behind These great Brands and I think we're going to see performance out of Reynolds in 1996 yes, well I can tell you that I have been very much in the business of speaking the Lord shareholders since I've been CEO of this company and I have not heard from mr. LaBelle where mr. icon but I'd speak to any shareholder this company and that's really about all I can say at the moment the only thing I can say about that is, I have no idea what mr. LeBeau is going to do the only thing I know is I've got a mandate from our shareholders to improve the performance of RJR Nabisco and that's what I'm going to do as far as mr. LeBeau is concerned he's going to have to figure that one out for himself, now my guess is the resolution was not defeated as soundly as mr. LeBeau and mr. Icahn work on the other hand our shareholders and the shareholders to whom I've spoken one us to do the best we can to find the right opportunity to spin off the Biscoe now my own view is that will come in the reasonably near future but what's, critical and I think what our shareholders expect management to do in a board of directors to do is not to wreck the company trying to do a spin-off first operate the company get the values that are inherent in that company for your shareholders and if you can spin off in the Pisco if you find the right time then go ahead and do it and keep in mind we've separated those companies the bisko's got it separate balance sheet now it's in a position to be spun off when the right time is there we'll find the right time, practice in Lexington percent of those voting chaplain the same way that's what I understand yet, no I don't not at this point I the only thing I was told really was nothing more than what Mike Harper said to our meeting which is that it did not command a majority of those voting and therefore Was Defeated I don't know what the vote was, I've talked to remember I've talked to quite a lot of our shareholders about why they voted in the consent solicitation and people even though it was a non-binding resolution on a particular issue people had a lot of reasons for voting in that consent solicitation they really some of them voted because they wanted to send us a message that they wanted us to get earnings up at RJR Nabisco as soon as we can others said they wanted increase dividends, others said they wanted us to spin off as soon as we could and there's a kind of a mixed message there I'll tell you something I myself believe that if we can do it at the right time we should separate these businesses so I share that same view with a lot of our shareholders but what the majority of our shareholders are saying today is they're not going to risk our company to trying to do a spin off at the wrong time, I personally blame him for every Dorn Penny of it, the tobacco company is been well represented in all of these matters they've got terrific counsel I think they've got a very good handle on the kinds of issues they're facing and I don't know whether you call them contingency plans or not but I think they've got all of those issues very well in hand, okay well let's take one more question if you have it, I think the fact that we got an opportunity to talk to our shareholders the whole process we've been through has given us a good sense of what they want and you can't always do everything immediately for your shareholders but I have gotten a good sense that they felt the cash power generating power the company is so strong that we ought to try to do more in dividends and frankly that's what we've done okay thank you very much, good morning everyone let me just briefly say how much I appreciate the tremendous support of our 10,000 employees here in Winston-Salem many of whom, tear their time to man that telephones to call shareholders employees Cheryl is retiree shareholders and shareholders all over the country to help win this Battle Force this little no labo sticker was something our employees thought of and passed around the company we've had tremendous support from the local community from all the people in the brokerage firms to people who care, we're about this company and we deeply appreciate the support of all those people and we will do our best to build a great future for this company yes and yes, we have a company-wide bonus system which allows for special bonuses for every single employee in the company when we have a Good Year everyone has a good year over and above their regular pay and benefits are pay and benefits are among the highest in the country period, we work hard to to save every job we can in this company every company in this industry everyone has downsized over the last decade the way we keep our jobs is we sell more cigarettes we make better cigarettes and we Market them better that's how we all keep our jobs no Union what what in the hell did the Union do for Liggett & Myers, I certainly hope so,picture of Cold Stone said he he was expecting double digit passcode both International and you say revenue or profit you specify double-digit volume sales and earnings has that in fact I think very strong growth in unit volume in some of the our newly Emerging Markets former Soviet Union, Union particularly we're running at flat-out capacity High profit margins obviously in the Soviet former Soviet Union are lower than you would find in more developed countries but we're up to 12 and a half share of market up from zero five years ago can you react to the comments made during the meeting that the industry is not doing enough to limits under a smoking, we are doing everything we know how to do and I would say it's not enough it's not just r.j. Reynolds it's all of the the forces working together we talked today about our support the law program we've had that independently studied by the University of Colorado we did a pilot program in Denver I mentioned that we were able to reduce youth access by fifty percent are right decisions, now program is a in over 110 cities reaching three and a half million students a year fully endorsed by the school boards and the principles they wouldn't keep using this program if they didn't think it helped is that enough no we need to have fundamentally tighter enforcement we support that we've got a major program going on in cooperation with the National Association of convenience stores and the food marketing, titute for training for signage and making sure that clerks behind the counter asked for ID that's a single most important thing we can do, yes sir earlier the company had said that they were going to reduce the amount of Joe Camel and and ads in the area so far we haven't seen that a lot of people outside the company has not ever made that statement company has never made a sale someone made that statement at the meeting today but we've never made that statement we use a variety of programs to Market camel and are other brands we do not, is Joe Camel exclusively we rotate to other other creative forms periodic it said it made that might Target younger folks because it's a cartoon character well question we have as you know may know this was studied by the Federal Trade Commission we supplied every single camel document we have 60,000 Pages they worked on it for three years and they concluded that, there is no evidence that this campaign encourages young people to smoke period I do not my testimony is a matter of public record I have reviewed every word of my testimony I would not change a word what I would do was maybe be a little more vocal when I was repeatedly cut off in my answers or, questions were answered for me if you go back and look at the transcript or look at the video you will find out that a I was asked the question are cigarettes addictive I started an explanation first a definition I was cut off and Congressman Wyden said I'll take that as a no and that was typical of the behavior of that committee all day I went there to tell the truth and the, the whole truth and nothing but and I knew there were some folks who wouldn't listen there, but if there were only five people in the audience are on TV who watched it I wanted them to hear and I strove to do that all day long, how would I know that two weeks later we did a survey 45 percent of all Americans said they had seen part or all of those hearings I had over 1,000 letters and phone calls from smokers and non-smokers and I had maybe two of those 1,000 were - one last question yes sir, a situation where I feel might be made for example of where you might be given immunity from lawsuits tobacco lawsuit in exchange for something FDA oversight FDA regulation this industry have a perceived possibility that that might happen when you support that well that that's a very hypothetical question our posture is we have strong defenses against every one of those suits we firmly believe we will prevail in court, and I do see in a broader sense it's not limited to litigation but there has to be some kind of reconciliation in this country that accepts that adults can make the choice to smoke and that we all are unified in keeping cigarettes away from kids and if we can begin to create joint Solutions on those I'm not opposed to, action provided that regulations purpose isn't to prohibit our product we work Germany's a perfect example we are regulated in Germany we have a great working relationship with the German regulatory Authority but in this case you read what the FDA proposes and it's not about kids that's a guys, industry at least look at it and it's working I can't say so me a proposal I've you know I'd look at anything but our focus is winning this litigation and we believe we will thanks very much",0.8377896651020408,0.67641884,0.9128388

attempt to leave like a bad aftertaste I think, also sometimes bad breath I think the mental somehow doesn't do that okay interesting place to place variety of words turn this Ryback great, I want to show you guys some ideas get your opinion about the ideas I had about three or four of them or show it to you and the way I'm going to do it I'm going to show the idea is to you twice the first time I can show you the ideas I literally want you guys to tell me what's off the top of your head as you see you spontaneously come forth whatever feelings you got like this like associations something interests you quirky little things whatever whatever comes to mind is so let me have it, second time will go around and ask you some specific questions the first time I just want to want to hear what spontaneously comes to mind let me clarify as you clarify some thoughts and things like that but basically just give it to me as it comes okay so we will go into another one you can leave your stuff here and you have the outside watch it so worried about you just follow me over,can I bum one, the spot, cigarette anytime is a good time this whole spot the name of the spot and obviously they're trying to say that any spot is a good spot to like one of our spots like at the bus stop or sitting on the beach or with your dog and any time any place it's always great to light up a spot I don't know about the name, Sweet Spot doesn't sound like a cigarette yeah sounds like home fries sweet spuds, anything with Sweden, the green circle, you know how to telephones have it, cigarettes Marlboro one word, Newport anyway, what kind of depends on the demographic whether you're trying to approach women or men or black sword away, yeah I don't know maybe women would drive, I myself wouldn't be interested sweet spots just I guess for the packaging alone almost, I can give you advertise it,sensual one name,personally I like because, it's a cool name is cool because, because you know it's also taking advantage of how you called my rose Red's adapts more to the mental,like you said before it's very essential I think has a lot of sex sex flavor to it if you didn't cells because for a lot of reasons people tend to smoke crosses demographics to I can see kind of it's got, It's kind of like a yuppie Jazzy feel but at the same time you can take it as more like an urban black graphic it works it's kind of a neutral campaign the color itself, it's good art drawings lips very good luck to you have detention I don't know no way you can think like the lips like this is where the cigarette goes and hey you know here it is are showing you what to do in a sense okay, another idea, look at these condition, I mean this is what, this is what a lot of people are wearing now just kind of style, especially stuff with graphics on it, how much work do it yeah, this is the actual packaging you know what you're welcome well actually no it's a mock-up, it's this is interesting compromising, I don't know why the Royal the crown that's like the Palm English, so hip hop thing yeah kind of it's a little confusing I wasn't, what royal 13 what does it mean what is the significance of 13 or oil or for a while what comes to mind, well I think of maybe a British cigarette but obviously it's not, and then just the 13 I mean that's significant with bad luck,it's nice bad guy, like the bag better than the cigarette to the this thing on the this first design here looks like it's a onesie that looks not fully completed three so that's that it's sloppy I don't really want to see a loosen the genic images of the number 13,I don't think marketing cigarettes, I pretty much pushing that bad look issue, which doesn't sound too pleasing smoking a cigarette out, well you know everyone knows that, smoking can cause cancer birth defects on and on so now if you have a server that out yeah my tells you it's bad you don't really want to do it, I think that because nowadays, like the gear that's nice, that's Chloe that's gold and silver yeah, okay it's nicer than like a white T-shirt with you could open a little shop and so it's go diagonal,watch out, okay so now this is something that would trust me myself just at least try give it a shot, medical I don't think these are good idea this packaging looks like a box of crayons, not saying that a child might get curious enough well I had same time I think it almost can attract from him more, especially things like this you know king daddy group Guerrilla girls on the channel but I was a kid I jump on this, nice big and total groups like that Tommy Boy Records this is pretty much just that more y or our Latin thing where, they might jump on this underage okay, then gives you the time, I mean visually this is the most pleasing for me but only because it's like a cashier exploitation after this I mean I don't want buy a pack of cigarettes is looks it's got like the dimension of the casa looks like it's got a gritty Urban post modern feel, it looks so good feeling but of course gospel quotes, what about is you about the exploitation phase that you use it well I'd looks to me like looking at this at first you've got somebody who's obviously drinking something doesn't look like he's having too much fun it looks like there's a wino desperation there's a people looking down this she'll hook she, she you know and is this the man who I mean what what is it there's a gun here it looks like here and his hand with a piece so that's a that's awesome, I just this fire around the building a week is this the distraught is the apocalypse or is it,it looks, the best the best color schemes for the Browns, it's cute,yeah, great party at one point that again goes back into like the black community where if you're trying to push it to one group it's not going to work I like that this is the best the best approach for the Storia because it's kind of, yeah it's a good idea it's more of universe like Cisco world, I think this kind of add is so before it's that's for you so what would you think about it, maybe that and like the Jazz cats that works I mean that's it's kind of like, how would you pronounce that for you think use yeah it's a nice excuse, and then I was I mean almost, I think the way I see it at the same time, let us go back to our original start, it's about what you think is oh he's trying to say that smoking is a part of culture a big part, lunch, that without advertising about any of these different you know schemes at, I guess it would be hard, that's constantly seeing it in different fashions, people's communication, I don't like this including all the cigarettes don't tell me what you don't like it first but tell me why is what do you think it's saying first, the same this one particular, commissioned to do something in the green, good much yeah you look at any of the forget about it very well someone, tipped out, what is the name sweet spot, what, satisfaction, you say you don't like it you don't like it because I just said named Sweet Spot I mean I think just the word spot alone it makes sweet might be able to get away with but spot just as I write for cigarettes about them no just thinking of all the names are on Newport camel I mean I guess because they've been around for so many so many years and of course like anything a new name always takes a while to you know, spot is not a very attractive work you look at it and to pronounce spot I mean it's got - a positive connotations I just took the word spot I'm gonna have a sweet spot so I'm going to spot on my lungs, irritating fit a different idea like the sweet Sun it could be even, I smoke and I know it's bad but, I don't think they should also encourage it, this is the one, look at the packaging, so chocolate bar I think the name, the name of the brand just signifies the packaging how to it, it's really yeah very classy everything you do a little smooth elegant classy,how's your ass for this, self, what is it who is a smoker, I can't really have someone Upper East Side 20-something, this isn't the thing with for me with cigarettes is a color scheme I bit the Marlboro pack looks so donkey a big jagging read this is kind of, British chocolate, give me a,find a scale that was totally whacked extremely fresh where would this be on that scale, six months and months of advertising for even an ounce, I agree that just a spot alone you know what attract people's eyes folks pot you know something like this and something just like this on a white background,what we trying to say here message you getting, was that a cool crowd smokes this, hip crowd, there is a shop not just it's like, England all the smoothest creamiest chocolates the whole thing scheme is like purple just reminds me of like cabarets chocolate the same color scheme as the other pack of cigarettes, I think it's wonderful it's wonderful because it says works because it says blue it's great, the title itself is white, blue could be sad, if you could, single out one color scheme for a cigarette, I got him in the color scheme is used I guess too much, it doesn't say too much to me actually it just seems like a gimmick something that I wouldn't even be interested in wouldn't even bother with it, if I had asked you to give me, I think blue I taste, good taste, the color scheme has anything to do with green is more significant, it's too much like a regular Benson address it's too blue it's not doesn't there's no meant involved,like this one, I really don't like any of my cell phone I had a peg I'm guessing be this one right over here I think he's playing the music, I think the door is very sensuous to have glue, it's good, I guess she's just I don't even know where to move, I mean what they're not really saying anything now that I'm sitting here let's go smoke cigarettes, dear, a surprising extremely smooth taste and new satisfaction smoking pleasure it's the new color, well it's not words that I haven't heard before associated, I like the color of taste, relationship having this is the most mature kind of thing in the room I think but it's still I don't, the color the women in the color and all that it's just need to work I think the marketing needs work but the the name of the cigarette works, I guess it's all this how it tastes, it's more of a younger crowd, 20s, I could see him with any type of nationality race pretty much anybody, what's their Circle to be into, what are they into, Smokin I guess I mean from Home Blues, and I don't know I could just really see anybody into this smoking, more young crowd though, is everybody here loved each of them so of everything, this looks kind of like a like a Paparazzi shot of Rod Stewart early 70s, yeah it's definitely for a young crowd, it looks very much like the marketing for Batman like the color scheme and everything, track this is very attractive, doesn't the one thing that cigarette companies have been able to do this, it causes a feeling of being wanted within some sort of generational the Camel Club of Marlborough Mile Club whatever this doesn't give me anything that I can incorporate it to my personality, it doesn't you know some cigarettes you know advertise with being active whatever being, independent woman whatever this has nothing for me too, well yes this is this cigarette, scale again extremely fresh where are we on that scale, little higher you know these are really cool,where you at, yeah, I'm not really with who they are but, like now I just think they're contradicting everything okay contradiction because Royal 13-inch is assigned a cigarette number 13 should be significant with the cigarette just for the people that are whacked out there, you said that shouldn't be, just work the number 13 should be a certified because just because of people out there who are stupid but there are people out there so I guess understand both sides of the coin, I don't know where the Royal comes in yeah but there's this is really weird is advertising here doing the guys look at himself in the mirror and he looks he's all dappered up mmm yeah he's looking to a crack know what is trying to tell you I mean me trying to say you know sick kind of way that all right you're you're beautiful the outside but as a result of smoking you're riding away you looked into merits showing yourself and push there you go no good, I think she feels too, I don't know I think it's ridiculous why would why would anybody I mean this is perfection is no longer the missing ingredient in the menthol cigarette, why would you start off campaign I think the wouldn't this is not we're not perfect they were throwing ammonia in your tobacco,the packaging is nice to look at comfortable to look at gives you something to do while you're smoking but, you're like me but packages all right yeah colors, if I, have you get a sense of, some of you said something about the tagline that's got nothing to do with questions about what what is, here I want to get a full sense about, some of you said really really wasn't working for you but I just want to get a full sense of why it's not working, not working, the use of quote quotations real or not is pretentious I think the packaging is ugly I think the name itself is ambiguous doesn't go either way, I wouldn't put luck and, what type of person do you expect,almost like a novelty, scale between fresh where are we, wow, scale of 1 to 10, isolate your attention here this is what you are looking at what is it trying to tell you that's what is trying to tell you, what are you getting more, I guess almost can be generated I mean with this advertising right here could be generated to anyone but then you'll go into things okay well can we generate anyone, I think it's fair to say that smoking is universal just how people is just how people are, it's almost a thing in common people have, I like the collage I like the fact that it's trying to to approach as wide a demographic base as possible, I like the little Caso ish jazz club picture it's cool, I like these two this is my favorite out of the form, I really I think that's the best image exit, saying what's he saying that you can have Asian eye or an area and I African lips and we'll all be together smoking are colorful I like I like, the kind of, Atlas he filled the background and then eating the dragon kind of like the North Africa needs that's great work, the name was a, huge, supposed to be like this use of color so they are, Hughes the the letter Z kind of smog, I don't think it's a good idea, rolls more, it's almost hard to pick out some people like maybe it's just something I've never heard anything like that before then again I guess I said that one Marlboro Newport or just as a sound signal, the, peg, cool spots for coffee work or the singer, everyone smokes and if they want smoke some really can't be that different, International cigarette, International brand for one world I think, if I had to, get you looking at this back to say what other kinds of seeds would you expect to be appropriate given what you've read between these two things I say yeah this is why this is getting this is what I expect, definitely pictures with people and two different kinds of things, I don't think that music yeah they could have used anything other than like art or you know these want to be possible to that effect it would have to use some type of art but I guess I miss you what kind of scenes and settings would I would you think would be size because you get besides he would you say that that Rings true I can see that there it was smog is right you know no smog okay that's appropriate not that it's a program for people right now, stretch over to give you what would work if you had to pick up a couple more pictures to put on a pack mule lots more effective as you say then, I don't know I I would do different collages with different colors and, like the collage thing I mean the it's nice it's appealing to the eye the color scheme of that but I can't really think of anything that's related to the Jazz scenario and what what it would be if we took a totally different saying something totally if it's if it's something that was different what would it be, maybe not having all the colors of the letters colored my takeaway from the name itself almost Blends into much and, this has yeah that mean this one has a more ecological feel to it I mean you know that that, strange this one is, if I'd ask you what kind of person would be carrying this, the packaging of this talk I would say like an African-American look son but then you look at an advertisement like this and I would think you know just about anybody gets funky decent cigarette I agree with Chris not the jazz musician I would think Intelligentsia people and, in cities I would put the other one in the collage I could see it appealing to Marlboros and suburbs hmm, so pretty, Forest marketing like everything except,so let me ask you, if I can get you to stretch out for a second I know that, Chris is gone to the John but you can walk around for this one little bit if I had to ask you, here for the taste of what you expect Royal for Tina taste like would that be I think it's, how would I describe the taste of world 13 tears Howard I would imagine it to taste how would you imagine I would imagine it to taste not strong not specific, credible flavorful, looks to me like kind of cigarette gives me a headache it's got too much other than tobacco and, okay when you break it up and it's not doesn't look like regular tobacco right right right, I can't see, Travis you what you think the taste of Sweet Spot would be like what you're saying, I think it would be a lighter cigarette I would kind of guess I would presume that it would taste sweet, like sweet it's sweet into the cigarette sugar, I believe, it tastes sweet and close to the filter, you say about being a school, I think blue is being more like a regular cigarette habit but I think blue is the closest to describe him and all taste I would probably consider blue to be somewhere down the line to Newport, I have to agree I think, we're going to look at new portal light because there's a huge difference between important life as far as consistency of them but I see cool refreshing yeah, if I had asked you about Hughes, I don't know am I allowed to take into the fact that I've seen the color scheme with a box I would consider him to be Mighty camel I don't make Cattleman, Rusev, so I agree almost exactly with friend that if it's supposed to be some type of universal cigarette that the majority of cigarettes at Arsenal environmental so, wouldn't like to be nominal to Europe, Ruby, collectively, if I had my scalp some of those, extremely flesh to totally whack, long this dimension, wind these cigarettes up, this would have to be the worst I mean that's just the the grossest I can use that one then this I have to go,guess, that kind of, no it's like reputa bility to it's like I feel like something the ones that are already established or more legitimate my minor, but I would have to say that, I've always kind of liked it that's good, these are like together on the same level, where you at I got come to a consensus pretty soon here I think these are really bad some reason they look like crayons and these go next to because this is too much I think, just, this is a great this is this is more casual I think more of okay's and have a cigarette no problem it's not an alluring box and it's just incredible I think so that's first one, all right I've got a lot of different orders here so I want you guys now to come together and say to yourself collectively, we like the blue right lose nice yeah I think that's the best loser, go for it talk to you about advancing Hedges box looks like a horrible couch slip, I guess if I had to pick collectively I guess who perhaps would be Salem was pretty ugly Packaging, the Hughes look like Beavis and Butt-head from far away if you really look at it they really didn't your I really do ready, so my positive with that and right which one as far as being yeah the end of the scale yeah where are we, I don't think that that bad I mean again it just appealed maybe the color scheme and too many children and it's just too much going on in there and guess what, guess I can go with that, help me understand, what's the absolute worst to I'm with Newport I think it's just it's just terrible packaging it says nothing about the cigarette, I got a lot of bad Benson had just got a lot of bad Newport where you at people, okay okay, well then let me ask you something different slightly different if you had to pick up one of these packs this is the new packs right now which one would you pick up left Adam besides the blue know between all four look up between blue and everything's we spot know right now please switch back Royal and fuse, we pick The Sweet Spot, so we're all over them so for you sweet spot is closest to what kind of taste you that's on the table they would because you too, Benson Hedges the you, blue is closest to what kind of taste on the table, this is closest to, yeah, taste on the table, okay, exactly, cigarette, do you think these are these don't see the beauty secrets we bought, this tobacco, code which I guess is a different name Internationals card, it's, you feel this box it's not a shiny, texture, you seem like the safest because Come On You Really Gonna smoke my movies, this would go for this one first right forget the name, I would because it's reminds me of like Dunhill or something like that just out of curiosity, if I were to tell you that Hughes is made up literally what they could find with the finest tobacco's from various possible, being Asia old world was the best tobacco's are defined as a blend get the best blender get fine what would that be seen, what would that be seeing you radiate last cigarette something that if I'm going to smoke around smoke something else - yeah really good blend, isn't this the courts little more than I would, I'm trying at this track and he kind of stick if it was chicken factory with a the front beep at the back wheels from all over the world the finest I could possibly find in a blend that would speak to that when I pull me in forever I say to you yeah well that would go along with the marketing campaign saying that it's, for some cigarettes, yeah they're I've always enjoyed I would appreciate a camel for the Turkish domestic okay so then the the marketing of the colorful world who smokes for Colorful World idea would make sense to you at that conference, there's a meaning to you and in fact the collage of Asian by the area 9 the average Clips in the whole thing then, feel what team if you're right to you, appropriate participating in the global smoking consciousness, I think it's a little more calling if I like that, you think of alcohol good liquor, I think some people do them to pay two dollars for certain certain things and you have cigarettes similar idea, yeah I would feel very good, thank you for your time thank you for your effort I appreciate it, you've been very helpful please walk out the door see the lady to your right take care of you thank you very much",0.8126746652499991,0.47443032,0.9128387

professional IndyCar racing division of the Marlboro Penske Racing team is to be a consistent winner to be competitive to have a vision that we have a team working together in One Direction the idea of vision really starts with what would you like to suggest to look like that a time in the future, ER and you say what would success look like a year from now for it and from that then you can start your plan Barbara Team Penske has really set the standard and Racing for quite a long time and what that means when I say that is if they're the best prepared race cars they're the best organized team out there when I start to work on Monday morning I already know what I'm going to be doing Tuesday and farther down the week Mondays already here you have to get the you have, to assume that that day is done you just can't think about my you've got to be ready for every call when you get up that morning, September 17th the racers assemble for qualifying and the pit crew perfects its routine as Marlboro Team Penske prepares to beat the track record is the first to go out the way that I job is changing these days that we have to rely on so many other people in order for us to be able to perform my job correctly you've got a crew chief he's basically the guy that oversees everything he's got a first mechanic which is his right hand man, that's the guy he goes to when when the heat's on and then you have specialty guys who come in like myself who does the gears fresh tires and a cold trap will cause Unser to place a disappointing 18th in the qualifying further back in the lineup all Tracy gets his chance to qualify a Ab in the field and for that we have a sense on paper but here the results are instantly put up a video screen so met nobody has this, questions they just have to look for the biggest change in the last couple of years has been in the electronics areas on the car and Telemetry and particular so we're actually looking over our shoulders he's driving now we were bombarded with lots of paperwork trying to find actual documents with The PowerBook everything is rather fingertips we can also show the retailer certain information that he may request, Tracy not only qualifies but beats the Nazareth track record with a speed of 185 miles per hour it's a new track record all weekend people for running really quickly this is this almost 2/10 pick any random practice did a poly learns about track conditions from Tracy before he goes out your teammate is really your yardstick, that you measure Yourself by you know I know I did when I was driving because I knew that that driver had the same equipment I did and if he was ahead of me and something I'm not doing something right well a lot of times we like to Talk Amongst ourselves because I might have an idea of some way to handle the situation or solve a problem do we have to make adjustments are we on the right track how can we do things better that's what continuous improvements all about it's continuous Improvement on the job on the baseboard but also continuous Improvement when you step back, back from the job to plan what you're going to do next so we constantly have to be looking at what are our options we've got to develop a game plan in order to meet whatever might be unexpected from the standpoint of rules are also issues that might come up from the standpoint of competition environment is changing rapidly, Lee we have many issues facing us out there in the field and in order for us to stay ahead of the game we have to continuously improve with a top speed of 185 point six miles per hour Mo Beach Tracy and takes the pole in qualifying the Marlboro Penske team is broken to track records at the Nazareth Speedway in the same day, September 18th the sellout crowd awaits the beginning of the 200-lap race looking forward to seeing Marlborough go over there yeah the the finish the Finish Line see how much I know about raising gentlemen start your engines there's the green here we go, the support you're putting your life at risk if you're out there to try to go as fast as you could physically physically drive the car with an 11 cm x over the lemon, anything can happen in a race a lap car can spit out in front of you and take you out or whatever leave the race Mario Andretti drifts into Eddie cheever breaking his car's front suspension and ready is okay in the battle for fifth place Adrian Fernandez attempts to pass Jacques Villeneuve, Hernandez hits the wall three times and walks away shaken but unharmed and Nigel Mansell unhappy with how his car is handling drops out of the race yet have tough skin and be able to grow things off your shoulder so rejection is part of the job there's nothing you can do about it just something you got to get comfortable in being successful because now you have to think about what am I going to do next I'm going to talk, top what I've just done the whole job is got faster and everything that Philip Morris has done for us is related to speed we've done Tire changes in six seconds five six seconds but under the gun I've seen you know in competitions and things like that a five second stop you have a program that you want to sell in you have to do a very quickly because he doesn't want to take too much time away from the store so you have to be on target with all the information It's always important, the quickest they say oh well we finished second s first move while Paul Tracy holds on to the lead little Al makes one of his incredible runs to the front from deep in the field fittipaldi is only a few seconds behind first you have to see why you starting the grade you know how it shows start in the fall and you can take the lead in turn one and you have to try to break away from everybody coming at certain points of the year you want to be at certain places just like in a, race okay at the halfway mark we want to be in the top five we want to talk about Flawless execution that's the key job of the Salesforce competition is so top of many cars right now it's just you know there's there's 30 guys out there that are all Champions and it's getting tough just to make it in the field we have for other companies chasing us and so you always have to stay on top of things and they're not letting go gray skies out here I mean they're still right on their tail boom or so we strike strike, trying to be the market here the each back on the street leader you products new programs new promotions and we as reps have to follow that bleed and I think through our leadership and some of the plans that we have coming up we are positioned to keep our share to grow through the last three months of the year and to make our move to finish the race for 192 of the 200 laps Paul Tracy holds on to the lead, well Tracy making that final turn out and ahead of the checkered flag waves give me the wind tunnel has it all Tracy has scored his first Victory Marlboro Team Penske sweeps to Victory placing one two three four the fifth time in 1994 winning obviously is the most important thing to me the good feeling inside demonstrates that your people have come together and you've given a product in the market and one with that product, act one of the factors that really keeps me going as I'm going out and selling a great product I'm very proud going out and selling the number one cigarette winning the greatest feeling in the world but you can't rest on your laurels fact right now in the region we're winning and that's the prime time when we should be doing more to prepare for the next race, when Marlboro and Penske joined forces in 1990 they set out to create a team with the best organization and most talented roster in IndyCar racing, since then Marlboro Team

fnpj0015,"look at me and talk with me and state your name I don't know okay my name is Cody Miller and I live here in Las Vegas, yes and customarily I smoke Alpine cigarettes Alpine lights prefer them because they're cheaper but go for the bargain I started smoking at age 32 isn't that weird I was always as always inhabit anti-smoking I know that I can use this, smoking because I was so tired of people around me smoking and secondhand smoke in my face and being offended by that I decided it was a mild case of if you can't beat them join them, how did your about Cliffs, well I was called for a survey and one thing led to another yeah I was I was totally without any ideas what it was going to be about other than pertain to cigarettes so what, well I from the presentation I knew that there were this was something extraordinary or that it that it reported to me and so I was looking forward to finding out if the product met the expectations that were raised by the material that they presented so well, my first impressions were I wasn't sure what to make of it because it did have a bit of a different flavor and it was a unique distinctive Flavour and at first I kind of liked it but it was there was uncertainty about about it however as I smoked more one cigarette followed another that I found I found growing, hang on me I began to really like the taste and found that they were smooth and Mild satisfying and I felt that if the material presented was correct that these cigarettes were far lower tar nicotine product and that smoking them wouldn't be quite as harmful as smoking the conventional cigarettes, I smoke Light cigarettes yeah primarily to cut down on the tar and nicotine yes I did, I really to be honest I couldn't tell the difference, right I just picked ice pick up the miles because they were the miles and I would have preferred the full flavor I probably would have went with those but since there really was no perceptible difference to me I went ahead and decided to go with the life so after you, oh yes and aside from that I I timed them I'd smoke when I smoked one of my regular cigarettes and their 100 likes by the way these are king-size I would count the number of Puffs that I would get and it would usually be 13 14 15 maybe, then when I smoked the eclipse the king-size Eclipse I would find that I would get on an average of three to five more Puffs on a cliff cigarette than on the help lines that with you yeah so I found that it was a shorter cigarette that smoked longer than the 100 and, that there was nothing mentioned about that many of the material they were said to smoke the same length and there's I wouldn't know whether another person's experience would be the same as mine but I tried that a few times and every time it's consistently about three to five cups more / cigarette after you after you're trying to did you like the other benefits that came came with oh absolutely, I find myself now that I've gotten used to these forgetting about about having an ashtray nearby I'm smoking a regular cigarette and I'll be walking around I'll have accumulated a large Ash and we'll be ready to fall off and where's that ashtray but with e-cigarettes not a problem because you never need an ashtray you just need a proper place to dispose of it when you're done, but I find that the benefits of the cigarette are certainly every bit as good as they were presented to be that the lack of secondhand smoke is truly truly great there is no smoke coming out the end of the cigarette right now and although they say it's 90%, and smoke free I don't see any that that can percent might be what I'm exhaling probably but I find other benefits as well I work occasionally with computers and I'm a musician and I play guitar and I play keyboards have a home studio and I often smoke while I'm working with one with my instrument, and frequently I'll have, I won't have to hands-free now in the past if I'm busy with my hands playing music I have a cigarette in my mouth it always bothered me to have the smoke pouring off the end of the cigarette going in my eyes burning my eyes going up my nose and being nasty and that problem is totally eliminated with the eclipse and put it in my mouth, I can hold it there as long as I want to As Long As I need to and there's no problem whatsoever and that's something I always hated about cigarettes was how if you take them away from your mouth you're fine I can't put them up take a puff but if you leave it in your mouth like you know some Joe mod cock into the over his cigarette that you fumigate yourself, and this has totally eliminated that problem another great thing is that when you're working around expensive electronic equipment there's a problem with ashes ashes and debris coming from up the cigarette and gets in between your computer keys and so forth and creates a problem and of course there, since there's no ashes on an eclipse there's a well there's a few little Little Ashes around the tip that lights up to convince you that it's a cigarette you're smoking but that's not a problem it's just minor, if you had to well since there's at least three things that come to mind it's kind of hard to pick one and I unfortunately haven't had the privilege of subjecting non-smokers to to smoking Eclipse cigarettes in their company and that's too bad because I'd really like to gauge their reaction and like to see, see how they feel about it but that would perhaps be one of the benefits right there would be the they're probably socially acceptable they may may actually be a an alternative for people who have been forced to take their cigarettes elsewhere they may be able to return and smoke in the company of non-smokers, we don't know I'm put I would like to I'd like to see the reactions of people now other smokers have have had various reactions I they're mostly favorable however to be truthful there have been a few problems my mother, he's 80 years old she's still smoking and he's a lifelong smoker still hanging in there and she feels that they are in her words too much work that there's too much effort involved in drawing the smoke and so forth and then the other problem she had was that there's a there's a great deal of heat that builds up in the body of the, above the filter and flowing here below the printed ring you're okay if your fingers get up there I'm going to look smoking a cigarette pretty hot Carson discomfort she claimed to have been burned by now I'm sure that these are problems that that they're working on it this week we searches, to help them develop the cigarette a little further but that's one of the things that one of the reactions aside from that my girlfriend comments that she thinks they're stinky he thinks they have an aroma that she doesn't like she smoked him she doesn't she like some fine so but she thinks they smell funny that there's something, about this month itself, I don't know if you guys both welcome it yeah was there a difference like in the amount of smoke gives you a good life oh yeah yeah and another thing I did playing around with them was to take the kleenex test and blow smoke through tissue and then do it with a regular cigarette and see the, difference in the yellow stains the tar stains on the tissue from a regular cigarette compared to the almost complete absence of abstaining from from the eclipse and also drawing the smoke directly through the tissue and on a regular cigarette you have a dark dark spot on there right away one paw and you have a dark spot you take, positive got a you've got practically a Black Ink Spot and with the eclipse taking three or four Puffs through the clean through the tissue there is hardly any stain that looks less than the than the one from the first puff on the regular cigarette now of course as you if you continue to do this going from the tip of the cigarette down to, or the end that's where the concentration is greatest thing there's just a huge amount of stain from a conventional cigarette however these cigarettes are consistent there's no more no more residual stain at the low end and there is when you first slide it so they managed to filter that really well though quality of this smoke is consistent, sure I think of a person has white or light-colored furnishings and curtains and draperies that sort of thing that they're going to stay white they're going to stay light and bright colors longer because, everybody know so you going to a smoker's house are smoking family's house that there is not just the odor that permeates the house but the stain the smoke color accouterments the draperies the curtains and even, the bed sheets and so forth are going to end up being yellow and I really feel that the eclipse is going to eliminate that problem for people if they smoke the eclipse consistently, I think so earlier on in the study I decided that I well even after the first the first phase of the study where I just had two packs I decided that I would want to have them around that if I stayed with a regular brand such as Alpine that I would want to have a clips for certain occasions when when I desired the, they offer and then as I continued in the study I began to feel that I would prefer to have these cigarettes most of the time and at this point I feel that I could pretty much do without the other cigarettes that these meet all my needs just fine yeah we're all so I'll take this time to, two, did you said you showed it to a couple smokers who were like yeah, yeah there's a few people that that were really impressed I think everybody was was impressed everybody was amazed there was a cigarette that was was this different this unusual and drastically different from what people are used to and I had one young lady asked me if I had a cigarette Despair and she took a look at the end, have sangria sure this isn't going to explode you're not heating give me an exploding cigarette ditch a serious it's a new kind of cigarette it's not going to blow up no I'm serious yeah she was she was pretty impressed she said they're good they taste great, so yeah her overall impression was good I ended up letting her I was giving her a little ride and let her out of the car before she had smoked the whole cigarette butt her initial reaction was very favorable once you got past the fear of it exploding, well I don't want to know why if there's an advanced in cigarettes that it's going to make cigarettes more socially acceptable than they they are present that are going to eliminate some of the reported dangers of, non-smokers and others to secondhand smoke I'd like to know why they would step in and try and stop that progress from being made and I would write my congressman and representative and present my side of the story and again asked them to look into the matter to allow us the, Adam to decide for ourselves, write a letter to my congressman and the House Representatives to the local and federal Representatives, and state why I thought that the cigarette was beneficial on the market and ask them to look into the matter and to allow it to to be present I'd want to know why they felt that there should be a law against it white if progress is being made toward making, taking cigarettes more while say making cigarettes and less harmful or less detrimental to the non-smoking public that that's something that should be encouraged rather than stifle and I would I'd certainly State my feelings on the matter and let them be know, one of the things I'm going to give you a first half of the sentence would be eclipsed makes me feel why aren't you here to me again so I know what I mean, me feel happy to be alive Clips makes me feel like smoking cigarettes is is enjoyable again and I can I can enjoy a Clips without feeling guilty that I'm subjecting other people to my smoke that I have I've made a choice, I've made it a choice to smoke cigarettes and and I can do agree with people that don't smoke that they shouldn't be subjected to the Smoke just because they're sharing the space with a smoker that time and I feel that really isn't fair and however the eclipse cigarettes have done manufacturers have done something to minimize that, and I really believe that smoking eclipse in public is less of a of an offense and less of a hazard to non-smokers children and other, now prior to my exposure to we clip cigarettes say that again prior to my exposure to Eclipse cigarettes I made my cigarette purchasing decisions, based on price alone and if I could find a generic cigarette that was tasting and burn evenly I buy it and my main consideration was to save save a dime for pack if I could whatever now these cigarettes the benefits of these cigarettes are so substantial to me, that I would pay the standard price of these cigarettes were available at the premium price like your standard Winston's are well I would say Marlboro but I think they've got the price on Marlboros but oh you know what I mean your standard premium cigarette price that would be fine because I believe there were, worth it and I would make them my regular cigarettes, yeah, prior to my exposure to a clip cigarettes I made my decisions about purchasing cigarettes based solely on the price and I was looking for a bargain I would buy any generic cigarette that that as long as it tastes good and burned evenly and it was fine by me however since my exposure to the clips, and the benefits that they offer I feel that if they were offered at the price of a standard premium brand of cigarettes that that would be a price that I'd be willing to pay to make Eclipse my regular brand, revolutionary, and at that one weird thing I'm a man of many words they are there were their revolutionary cigarette there's never been anything like them, I think he's not a good",0.8305009877777778,0.5981993,0.9128386

fpnh0063,"ladies and Gentlemen please welcome the director of Market planning and information and E-Pass look and group manager sales analysis Susan Smith, good morning Susan and I will present an industry overview to include significant events and Trends affecting our industry our competitors and lorillard itself, in terms of format will look at the legal political and social events that helped shape our environment this year, then we'll look at sales performance for individual companies Brands and product segments based on our latest available data, 1997 so many of the same themes we had observed in 1996 extended into 1997 some of them now with interesting twists for example 1996 so a link it's Bennett labo financier Carl Icahn and RJR Nabisco Management in an acrimonious fight whereby Nabisco was in simple terms to either be taken over by Liggett or, broken into several pieces by icon, the Liggett attempt at a merger and the icon takeover attempt were both resolved with RJ Are Victorious and intact however Liggett continued to function as an industry gadfly as they went their own way on legitimate litigation settlements ingredient disclosures conceding cigarettes are addictive and in releasing internal confidential documents over the other manufacturers objections, how ironic that it appears that Liggett initiated the process that could they say lead to their ultimate demise, the unrelenting flood of litigation continued on into the year with now more than 40 States suing the industry for the most part in order to recover health care costs they maintain are attributable to smoking related illnesses, unfortunately as we moved into 1997 and now into 1998 many smell blood in the water and are joining the potential Feeding Frenzy to come, here we see that the industry is being sued by construction trade unions in Connecticut insurance companies in Louisiana the higher education school system in Alabama and on it goes all of them bidding for a piece of heretofore unimaginable billions of dollars, and along with the litigation Trend toward greater government regulation, and restrictions has intensified, the FTC succeeded in getting rid of old Joe camel's successful icon and now appears to be looking next at the mall Borough man, David Kessler formerly head of the FDA claim to be anti tobacco advertising in order to protect our youth, it now appears that his real agenda Banning tobacco advertising aimed at adult smokers as well has been revealed, and municipalities continue to get into the act the map depicted in the upper right corner of this slide shows the New York City council's plan to deal with cigarette advertising, no Billboards permitted within a 1000 foot radius of each dot on the map, to paraphrase the Old Chestnut about bad luck it seems if there weren't any bad news there wouldn't be any news at all, nevertheless unlike mr. Ed's demise our story has a happy ending, important to many of us and perhaps the reason most of you are in the audience today is the fact that lorillard moved its corporate headquarters to Greensboro from New York City this past spring some of us perhaps had inflated or exaggerated expectations about what to expect regarding living in North Carolina, in addition to the fair in addition to the favorable personal housing situation we were favored with a terrific work environment, hear our corporate and Company management participated in a ribbon-cutting ceremony to officially open the building, it's very nice as you will see when you take the tours of the offices organized for you later on today and tomorrow, actually although it really is a wonderful work environment there was one small design flaw the building does not have a separate restroom for executive management as was the case in New York, Senior Executives have had to get the hang of sharing the facilities with mere mortals, no one really likes this Arrangement very much, and while the ribbon-cutting ceremony was going on the Marketing Group celebrating the transition of their Department name to Brand marketing celebrating the opening of the new building celebrating a new one official motto for the headquarters complex and God knows what else we're dedicating the pond on the north side of the building in their own way, without doubt the defining event of 1997 was the tobacco industry's participation in a global settlement of the many issues that have led to the unending stream of litigation we commented on earlier now try as we might we have to this point been unable to meet to work our meeting theme working together for Success into the presentation, and we certainly can't do that at this point for example, here's a collection of comments counter proposals potential revisions from members of Commerce Congress on the proposed settlement, it documents 23 senators and congressmen 's individual plans to change void proposed entirely new settlement terms in the days and weeks following the original attorney general tobacco industry proposed settlement perhaps it's no wonder that Congress appears to be unwilling to resolve the matter in relatively short order there does appear to be a lack of Direction at the top, and with this leadership really who can blame them, once it became clear how much money was stake given just the Florida and Mississippi settlements The Feeding Frenzy really moved into high gear, here we see just about everyone tried to get a share of the settlement spoils individual states the federal government various government agencies tobacco Growers and of course the unending stream of lawyers perhaps this editorial cartoon says it all on that subject, throughout all of these distractions I've talked about let us not lose sight of some more fundamental truths our competitors have not and will not let these things stopped or slowed their efforts to succeed in the marketplace the pressure is always on our Jr is resilient here you see news of a new camel advertising campaign without Joe Campbell the launch of a mental camel brand to directly challenge new, a port in the marketplace and news of additional line extensions targeting Fringe prospects for the camel brand through camel red, RJ R is implemented a direct attack aimed at Newports younger adult franchise in New York City through a repositioned Salem brand, and it didn't in addition to efforts to re-establish the Winston Brand, all this activity took place this year BMW launched a new advertising campaign in support of their Cool brand and still other competitive efforts may be dwarfed by the coming introduction of Marlboro ultralights in January, now all the negative pressures and influences on the industry have nevertheless led to a somewhat surprising result, unit shipments for 1997 versus 1996 will decline We Believe by 1% or less in fact over the last five years the industry's volume decline averages just about one percent per year given these prevailing Trends Laura large performance is all the more impressive up approximately 3% in unit volume and up slightly more and share of Market, two most clearly show how Laura large performance relates to that of the industry as well as competitive companies by Price segment and brand this National overview now concentrates on share of market trends for each, data are based on the latest available you two day period ending September 1997 versus the same nine months a year ago, within our industry the greatest change in recent years has been the turnaround at the full price segment following the major price restructuring in 1993 even now more than four years later full price share currently almost 3/4 of the market continues to increase however while all companies initially benefited from the Resurgence in full price importance only Philip Morris is presently experiencing growth in the, the segment this graph tracks full price share Trends on a quarterly basis since 1992 as can be seen full price importance Rose most dramatically immediately after the industry's price restructuring in August of 1993 yet even since that initial impact full price share has continued to rise having now reached nearly 74 percent of Industry sales or back to the level that, is premium products enjoyed nearly six years ago, breaking down the full price segment by company this table summarizes year-to-date 1997 full price shares for each and then Trends versus year ago both in terms of Point changes as well as percentage differences with gains highlighted in yellow, in total year-to-date full-priced year is up nearly one point with almost with all of that game coming from Philip Morris up almost two points versus year ago conversely each of the other companies have shown losses ranging from 1% for Reynolds to 21% for liquid, of course Laurel Arts loss includes the elimination of two brands that is Harley Davidson and full price style nevertheless even with the impact of these two discontinued brands on our full price trend we continue to outperform and pull further ahead of BMW in this most profitable category, in the face of full price growth the importance of discount products continues to fall however within the discount group the larger branded generic segment has now stabilized with BMW and Reynolds holding share and Laurel Arts new entries offsetting losses for Philip Morris and Liggett at the same time Sheriff private labels which are lowest in price but have no other image are suffering an, I'd rate of decline down 20% this year versus last with all of our competitors losing share from these products this chart Compares share Trends over the last six years for the total discount segment as well as its two components generics the darker lower portion of the bars and private labels the lighter portion on top, in total Sheriff discount products has fallen 10 points since 1993 when their price Advantage was sharply reduced and while the black and white private label group had consistently been declining at the greatest rate this year it is the only price segment that is down off one full point below a year ago now representing just 4% of Industry sales, in contrast after three years of losses the Branded generic group actually showed a fractional increase this year, looking first at generic share Trends by company we can see that the top two contributors to the segment BMW and Reynolds essentially maintain levels versus year ago and while Philip Morris and licking each lost over two tenths of a point those declines were more than offset by Laurel Arts gains tracing to our new entries Maverick specials and at least for a while low price Style, turning to the same breakdown for private labels we see losses for all of our competitors in this group Reynolds is the leader and has the lowest those still sizable rate of decline down 18 percent in comparison Philip Morris is private label share is down 26% now ranking just slightly above Liggett which is also off sharply, now combining all products we see that total share has declined for three companies Reynolds by 2% Brown & Williamson down twice that rate and lick it off a whopping 28 percent more importantly of the two companies that are growing Laurel Arts relative share increase of 4% is actually higher than that for Philip Morris, now let's take a look at the Brand's both full price and discount that are primarily responsible for the share performance of each company beginning with lorillard, in 1997 lorillard will achieve its highest share in 14 years by brand the company's current share growth of 4% is coming from full price Newport and discounted Maverick specials, this chart Compares shares for Newport and all other lorillard full price and total discount Brands again based on nine months year-to-date 1996 in Orange versus 1997 in green with actual point changes on top, I pull Our Brands Newport is certainly the greatest contributor to Laurel Arts volume and growth up another four tenths of a point this year, but again transfer remaining Brands by Price group have been distorted by product replacements, the impact of these brand changes on Laurel Arts full price segment is summarized here as you know full-priced Harley-Davidson was discontinued last year and in May of 1997 the price of style was lowered together the removal of these two Brands reduced our full price total by nearly half a point note that without their affect our full price share would actually have been up, similarly our discount share Trend this year has been affected by the addition of new entries Maverick specials which replaced Harley and style at a reduced price note here that despite the support required to introduce these new products old gold fell only slightly, combining old and new versions of reposition Brands this chart Compares 1996 versus 1997 share trends for all of our major products other than Newport of the five Kent has had the greatest loss but is showing much stronger Trends in the heavy of markets of our next two Brands true which is a National Distribution is now just one one-hundredth of a SharePoint ahead of old go, old which does most of its business in just a third of the country Maverick also a regional brand is of course new butt has already achieved a Shear that is substantially higher than Harley held last year, finally style despite new packaging positioning Promotional and field support the sales potential for this brand remains limited as a result style has now been discontinued which will free up resources for other brands, now turning to our competitors will begin with Philip Morris share for this company is up nearly one and a half points or 3% to virtually half of the market gains Trace almost entirely tomorrow bro which has also reached a new Peak and although Philip Morris discount share is declining they're leading generic basic is up, this chart illustrates the importance of Marlboro to Philip Morris relative to all of their other full-price brands as well as their discount segment in 1997 Marlboro has gained more than another to share points and now accounts for 35% of Industry sales and 47 percent of full price volume, of the company's remaining full price Brands Virginia Slims Benson and hedges and Merit are nearly equal in size but all are losing share with Merit off most the last major entry Parliament is just 1/3 the size of the other three brands but has gained shared this year due to the growth of its non mental blocks packing, about a quarter of Marlboros gains are being offset by losses on Philip Morris's discount products however their leading generic and second largest brand basic is up slightly all of the company's other discount entries continue to slide and collectively now account for just four percent of Philip Morris's sales, next Reynolds despite gains for their two most heavily promoted products camel and Doral Reynolds share is down six tenths of a point or two percent all of the company's remaining Brands continue to lose share although the initial impact of Winston's restage has cut losses for that brand, looking first at Reynolds full price segment only camel is showing growth and is now just two tenths of a point away from overtaking Winston as Reynolds leading full price product but both of these brands are currently benefiting from new product efforts in the case of Winston a restaged product claim to be 100% tobacco with no additives was nationally introduced in July of this year, this graph summarizes quarterly share trends for the brand over the past two years and clearly shows the effect of inventory replacement and heavy initial promotional support for the new Winston product during third quarter in fact the Brand's year-to-year share losses have been cut in half by this restage but it remains to be seen whether the no additive positioning will be able to stem Winston's long-term erosion, camel has also been helped by a new introduction in this case two men full box packings which were first shipped in November of 96 as we saw for the new Winston product initial inventory build and promotional volume for Camel Menthol were fairly strong but by the sixth month each of the two new mental packings appeared to have plateaued at less than a tenth of a point, nevertheless camel mental did serve to Triple the Brand's overall 1997 sharing priests, turning to Reynolds discount segment we again see us for Philip Morris only one brand gaining share in this case Durrell but all private labels including Reynolds continue to slide and the importance of the company's remaining generic brands is rapidly dwindling, next Brown & Williamson as you know at the end of last year BMW sold six of the brands they had acquired in their 1995 purchase of American Tobacco to Commonwealth a small company in Kentucky note that for comparability of trend comparisons these brands have been removed from all previous BMW totals, yet even excluding the loss Brands company share is down six tenths of a point or 4% with only GPC showing growth, with in BMWs full to play full price group pool has had the greatest absolute decline but relative to its size it's down about the same rate as most of BMWs other full price products in fact the only BMW full price entry not declining is Capri the ultra-slim female brand which has held share during the past year, within BMW's discount segment GPC is the dominant factor in 1996 this company leader lost share for the first time to turn the brand Trend around BMW introduced GPC medium in July changed its packaging in September and has been aggressively promoting the family with by downs and coupons throughout the year, all of Brandon Williamson's other discount products are declining with lawsuits ranging from just two one-hundredths of a point for Misty another slim female brand like the pre to two tenths of a point for their private labels, lastly we have Liggett who share is declining at the greatest rate down and astounding 28 percent in just one year as a result of this company which is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy now accounts for just over 1% of Industry sales with none of their products showing any growth, looking at liggett's actual shares by Price group we see that their total full price importance on the left has now fallen to less than half a point lick its overall loss however traces primarily to their discount products both generics and private labels which account for three-quarters of the company's business, now combining All Brands let's compare the current relationships of those that are most responsible for industry performance in total the top 10 families now account for over seventy seven percent of Industry sales of three percentage points in just one year, the increasing importance of these Market leaders obviously reflects the commitment of companies to most heavily support those brands with the greatest strength and potential for us that brand is Newport which continues to widen its lead as the number one mental and number two brand overall, this chart Compares year-to-date 1997 versus 96 sure levels and trends for Marlboro the nine remaining top 10 brands and all others here the increasing dominance of Marlborough is most apparent now accounting for more than one out of every three cigarettes sold and continuing to increase share of the remaining nine brands in the top 10 group 5 are also growing with Newport showing the, the greatest absolute gain and thereby widening its lead as the second most popular cigarette in America stepping back just one year this graph summarize chairs of the number two to number five brands from 1995 in yellow to 1996 and orange when Newport leaped past Doral GPC and Winston to capture second place, now adding 1997 we see that Newport continues to grow at a faster rate than either der allergy PC the to Discount brand leaders in contrast number five Winston has suffered ongoing declines and as a result New Port is now one and a half points ahead of this brand which it actually trailed just two years ago to summarize here are the actual 1997 year-to-date chairs and, friends for each of the top five brands, for our growing but relative increases our highest for Marlboro and Newport each up 7%, of the remaining top 10 brands only two are also increasing that is camel whose gain largely reflects introductory volume for its new mental packings and basic which of the three generics and the top 10 group is up the least and therefore has now dropped below camel to Seventh Place, ranking 8th and 9th are Salem and cool Newports most direct competitors these two mental Brands would tick which different share by just for one hundredth of a point are declining at similar rates of five and six percent but Virginia Slims which remains number 10 is nearly holding share, finally let's take a brief look at the mental segment of our industry which is most important to Laurel art in total mental importance is holding at 25% of Industry sales within the Menthol Market only two established brands are showing growth Newport the leader and Marlboro which continues to make inroads into the segment, this chart breaks out current mental shares and Trends versus year ago by Price group generally mental Trends are similar to those seen for the industry overall that is growth for the full price segment relative stability for generics and heavy losses for private labels, looking at cheer levels and trends for key Brands within the growing full price portion of the Menthol category we again see Newport significant growth in sharp contrast to the continued declines for Salem and cool camel of course is new so the only other established full price mental with growth is Marlboro which though just one-fifth the size of Newport has benefited from the Brand's overall momentum, nevertheless based on this picture of Newports performance over the last four years it is clear that this is the brand that remains the most formidable opponent for all mental competitors, this concludes our review of Laurel Arts 1997 sales performance and how it relates to that of the industry and competitive companies by Price segment and brand in summary here is what those comparisons have shown, despite ongoing negative pressures 1997 industry sales are expected to be just slightly below 1996, but while the marketplace in which we compete is still losing volume Laura large sales this year will be approximately 1 billion units higher than last year, looking at full price importance we saw that the turnaround in this segments Trends which began four years ago has continued with 1997 market share up another full point to 73 percent by company this increased races to fill up Mars the full price leader due to its powerful Marlboro brand, but Laurel Arts full price segment is down only because two Brands were repositioned excluding these are full price total would be up as well, in the face of full price share gains the importance of discount products has declined three percent this year with private labels off 20% and branded generics just holding share, but unlike all of the other manufacturers Lords discount share is up due to the successful introduction of Maverick specials and the relative stability of the old gold brand, fiber and six of the top 10 leaders are gaining share, of these rates of growth have been greatest for the top two Marlboro the non-mental leader and Newport the number one Menthol in the country, finally only two companies Philip Morris and lorillard are gaining share and volume overall which is the ultimate measure of success but relative to the size of each Laura large rate of growth is highest, based on these results there is no question that the commitment of everyone in lorillard has continued contributed to a very successful 1997 and given this solid foundation we will enter the coming year in a strong position to meet new challenges and working together take advantage of all the opportunities available to us for continued success thank you thank you,something seemed eternal",0.8613482100917428,0.661857,0.9128387

feeling on, what do you expect the taste of blue to taste like, cool that we expect to taste Royal 13 taste like what do you like the taste of, cues to taste like, I think they'll be somewhere in the middle of here in here, but that sweet spot where we expect that, I would say almost like a new portal so sweet now all those four Brands were in front of you Devon which will you pick up the smoker, which one would you pick up the smoke, I don't have the brains here but, this is going to be blue, this is going to be Hughes, this is going to be, sweet, and this is going to be royal 13 okay place these Brands along this line where you expect them to be to be though no it's like where would you expect to be in reference to these brands, so basically we got, somewhere Newport and blue you expecting the taste pretty similar to glue sounds better to improve my like going to be better than Newport okay and you got The Sweet Spot you got cools, you got Hughes, then you follow the on the wax side with pnh Royals, and then Salem, okay so you expect that the area pretty good decent taste out of this blue close to Newport maybe even a little bit better and I when I think I see here you're saying you spent the decent Taste of Sweet Spot also, better than cool, not as good as new portrait better than cools hughes's in As Good As cools is but it's real now absolutely, because you're basically saying some respects a little bit better taste than that out of there okay the Royals is way down there on the loaf on the down low low side just take that, because the pension answer is I don't know yes like ran from cigarettes and hang out for a second I'll be right back, appreciate it alright thank you very much thank you for your time thank you for your

LeBeau is that the reason why the stock has fallen back is because he announced a settlement laveau's Liggett group settled several state tobacco lawsuits Wall Street worries that will invite a legal Feeding Frenzy RJR had no official response to Lobos concession the company will tell its side of the story to shareholders Wednesday I expect the company to, really reiterate its strategy for improving the value of the stock and reiterated its commitment to spending off Nabisco when the when the moment is right this moment may have passed but he does still hold at least one card he can call a special shareholder meeting to push management for a spinoff Katherine Barrett CNN financial news New York, it was reported earlier been at le beau today conceded defeat in his six month effort to support of food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco he joins us tonight to talk about his efforts and future plans could have you back that's to be back at this point what what do you blame your defeat on or who do you blame for that defeat I think most of the institutional shareholders didn't quite understand the settlement agreement that we came up with I think it took you know it was, just announced about three weeks ago it's taking time for to filter out the people initially the institution at the institutional investors were at whatever the margin supportive of your efforts then backed away do you feel you just simply failed to explain it because many of them expressed to us today and you saw and Catherine burns report earlier disappointment with the settlement well I think and they don't understand the implications are but you also have the problem of large institutions and we film our stock and rgr stock and the, the feedback and Philip Morris not being you know reflected in the RJR situation so it s times will take time for people to understand I think in time the sun was the right thing to do and we do it again we think that's the right thing do you think that that settlement will be of help absolutely I think it will be approved by the court and will be upheld yes and at the annual shareholders meeting who will be there in your and your place tomorrow Daniel shares mean they gave us two minutes to get up and speak out of anyone going speak for 2 minutes ago, minutes isn't enough for or not not enough to get that get your message across what do you do now you've reached this point this round to RJR Nabisco is management for the you do in the next round well we of course myself and Carl Icahn we only put 90 million shares of stock for the second-largest shareholder here we have a major investment we tend to maximize the investment and as we've been agitating for six months now the way to do that is for the company's spin-off the Biscoe we want the Biscoe spun off and that's still our goal and the man, one of RJR Nabisco so that's their goal as well you have a different time table perhaps a different approach there's do you think that perhaps is the British say you were perhaps too clever by half and reaching that settlement when you did I think the settlement was a right thing at the right time I supported and I continue to support it and I think time will show that we were right in doing the settlement okay why I think it's time for tobacco companies to stop fighting and sit down and settle and there's a lot of talk now a lot of politicians are coming around a lot of riders a lot of, journals are saying maybe we should sit and talk and make a deal I stopped all this legal thing I mean I've are gr and Philip Morris left so much equity on the table here yet Philip Morris have great company is trading in such a way Lou where domestic tobacco comes being valued at zero and our jars trading for two times in our earnings in the back of side one of the things that you didn't up with Philip Morris but with RJ are you did when the right for a shareholders meeting are you going to exercise the right to explore options now, go for it where is Carlos also know the story on seems to have major investment and it's a very support of the whole situation is you know supportive in the last time you and I talked in the midst of this battle we talked a bit of my car but he has not been quoted he's not been at all out in public with you why not because I talk every day I mean she knows everything that's going on he's been supportive supportive of public but I don't know if you have to ask all why I mean he wants to your, his partner I have two generals I guess leading the charge just one and then we kind of started I would be the one to do it it's no I'm the backup person we have ligand where we Now understand the business and did the settlement Carver support of the settlement and agreed all the way through as a principal shareholder of RJR having lost this first battle what do you think is going to unfold what is your plan specifically from here but what can you do the institutional investors have backed away from you at least through this part of the bat, did you say either they don't understand or don't agree with your position in the settlement and its effect on the prices and evaluation what happens now I things up to the management now do something little the stock still 29 7h today the stock is going to going nowhere it's up to management spin-off in the Pisco and do

frgp0190,"mr. Coleman some serious charges have been raised on the floor of the Senate and even in the tobacco publication but the tobacco companies are organizing to thwart the ban on broadcast advertising of cigarettes now we understand a meeting has been called to discuss this problem can you tell us about it and whether you plan to attend, I can tell you about the meeting I do not plan to attend that meeting will be attended by chairman of the Federal Communication Commission the president of tobacco Institute in the president of the National Association of broadcasters and the purpose of the meeting I gather is to try to clarify the a new law which reflects the fact that cigarette advertising will be off the air we volunteered to go off the air we plan to be off the air, we agreed to do this the law provides it we plan to adhere to the spirit and the letter of the law we're not going to advertise cigarettes on the air, from CVS Washington in color Face the Nation a spontaneous and unrehearsed news interview with Joseph Coleman third chairman and chief executive officer of Philip Morris Incorporated and chairman of the executive committee of the tobacco Institute mr. Coleman will be questioned by early avel science editor of wcbs-tv News New York Morton mints of the Washington Post and CBS News correspondent George Herman, mr. Coleman as you know some of these charges that certain cigarette companies plan to try to sneak in some hidden advertising so to speak of there is any such thing are so serious that as I gather the chairman of the FCC has called this meeting do you think that no one is planning to sneak in a little commercial here and there on the corner of the camera well this question has come up recently of course many of these sporting events have been sponsored by cigarette companies for a number of years it's not a, new development and it's been known that they were going to sponsor these events for at least nine months I would say that I am confident in the Integrity of the other President's chief executive officer of the other companies I do not feel I'm confident they are not going to subvert the law and are going to try to circumvent the law what we need here is clarification the law says cigarette advertising will be off the air and cigarette advertising will be off for you what, leave a meeting with the dean Birch will concern itself with is the question of clarification this is a new law and we need clarification I think the broadcaster's need clarification and apparently the Federal Communication Commission is going to help us in this matter but I'd like to say that many of the articles that have appeared in the Press I feel are misleading the companies are very sincere they're law-abiding and they're going to abide by the law, well I have no doubt that you're abiding by the law literally but say if your company sponsored is a Virginia Slims tennis tournament an Invitational for women tennis players isn't that really an effort to get around the intent and spirit of the law which is to stop as I understand it the the spirit is to stop the use of the airwaves to promote cigarette smoking, well that's a good question is two men so I would say to know the purpose for our sponsoring Virginia Slims Invitational tournaments is to help the ladies antennas to to get a chance to to get prize money and to show their prowess before a lot of people in the areas where they're playing the tennis matches their there is no plan to telecast these tournaments and let's just on premise promotion in the areas, they're going to have the tournaments and we plan to adhere to the spirit and the letter of the law these tournaments have not been telecast now for example we've been sponsoring the US Open tennis championship at Forest Hills for a number of years we think that people have appreciated that sponsorship we won't be able to sponsor it in terms of television commercials in the future but our sponsorship of sporting events will continue without television exposure, you're our company makes a number of other products besides cigarettes do you have any plans for example to increase the amount of are advertising broadcast advertising for those products which may bear shall we say name resemblance or a look resemblance the cigarettes, well that's been raised too many times we don't happen to have any such product we're also in other businesses such as chewing gum and dear I'm not going to mention the products I would say that no there is no intention the will be no intention to subvert the Lord to circumvent the law and I feel absolutely confident that this will not be done by my company and I feel just as confident won't be done by the other coming but I cannot speak for them today not particular area I'm glad, brought that up because I think this brings me to another point that I do want to make the relates to that question we have tried to be responsible and responsive we have been responsible in many ways over the years we've discontinued all campus promotion activities when this was brought to our attention is being not appropriate we have discontinued advertising and college newspapers we have discontinued the use of celebrities the use of sporting figures in our advertising, and the use of testimonials by them further than that we volunteered to go off the air which was a very big move to attempt to clear the air so we have shown I think responsibility and we have been responsive we are also very concerned about the charges leveled against our product and we're very anxious to do whatever we can to clear the air in this manner we happen to be optimistic about the future and we happen to feel that this is a great industry and the business industry, can face the future with confidence because when as an if any ingredient and cigarette smoke is identified as being injuries to human health we are confident that we can eliminate that ingredient before we get into the medical aspect which I think now you're leading us into I just want to finish off on the advertising question are you not involved in a lawsuit to test the constitutionality of this law Banning broadcast advertising the tobacco Institute or your company no one not the mr. Herman I'll, I think you're referring to the question of the fairness Doctrine yes out of Communication Commission that relates to the question the fairness Doctrine was invoked by the Federal Communication Commission and they required that all broadcasters are and e-cigarette messages without charge and approximately a percentage of 123 regular cigarette commercials now that we're off the air the Federal Communication Commission has ruled this is no longer a controversial and hence, broadcasters who are an e-cigarette messages do not have to are the rebuttal by the tobacco industry but the Federal Communication Commission went on to say that the stations may do this the issue here is whether if and e-cigarette messages are aired by stations after the cigarette commercials go off the air don't think tobacco companies have a right to rebut and answer the question under, to the fairness Doctrine if it was a fairness Doctrine you personally then are satisfied that this ruling of a products advertising illegal products advertising off of some media of advertising and not off of others is a constitutional and fair within the law process within the powers of the Congress well we volunteer to do this understand I'm just questioning of the legality well the legality of something that I don't think I'm qualified to pass on here I will say that the Congress passed the law it has not been tested, stood yet from a constitutional standpoint is being tested I think you may also be referring to a suit brought by a number of radio companies for us that was not bought brought by the cigarette industry mr. Coleman now that you'd not advertising on, on radio and television you can have a little bit money left over I think in your company something like 30 million dollars a year perhaps for the industry as a whole quarter of a billion you can use that money for example to do more research to settle the health question the research is going to get a certain an expanded amount of mind that that matter comes up all the time that's subject what are we going to do with the extra money, are we well what are you going to do with this well I can only speak for my company and what I believe the other companies will do of course this is a very competitive business we will continue to spend money for promotional purposes and some of it will go and print some will go and point of sale somewhere going on premises promotions we will be spending it on an expanded sales forth but a lot will go into expanded research and the desire to get the answers to these questions what is a loss what percentage of your advertising, using budget for example there is a question that I anticipated I don't know how to answer that question if they're so different items when you try to get a message through to 200 million Americans 65 million smokers and you compare that figure to a figure for research this is a very difficult figure to come up with I have to know roughly what our company is going to spend I think it's a large for you we are, building right now a whole new Research Center in Richmond we are expanding we have been expanding our commitment to research both product research product improvements and research in the area of smoking and health I'm just trying to put it in proportion because the figures is I've been able to get them and they're kind of mixed up in the facts and different standards but as I've been a is mirrors I've been able to figure out it's about 1% or less of the advertising budgets that is that is not not true mr. Herman I would say that in, 81 something in the area of of a half to a third will go into research compared to our advertising for your company or for tobacco hospital because big the tobacco industry advertising come to like 250 million a year and you would you like failures have been reduced to two hundred million all right would you think half of that 100 million a year is going into research no I wouldn't say that for the I can't speak for the other companies I'm talking overall research product research product and provide health resort in health research, but I want to say this that I've been advised for a number of years of problem here is not funds the problem is Direction confidence and trying to find out what do we want to ascertain how do we want to assert a right well I'll go look Morton is straining at the bit here but not one question of that that I would like to ask one of the most controversial of the recent experiments has been the one of the smoking Vehicles who were forced by a hole cut in their throat to smoke cigarettes smoke and came up with a number of, cancers neoplasms growths tumors all different kinds of words to describe it the problem that that I come up with is this it was immediately jumped upon by the tobacco Institute and thoroughly denounced for various reasons some of which is since evaporated I understand some of which have not my question is this how many dogs or laboratory animals have comfortable size has the tobacco Institute financed experimentation of that kind on how many vehicles have you had smoking we've had animal and Elation test, on all over the world not sponsored only by the tobacco industry but sponsored by independent research actor for over 25 years and I might say that these tests have always been - they have never been able to induce lung cancer in animals due to inhalation of cigarette smoke and I would like to comment on that our backgammon reporter this is a very important development that was announced as you may recall on February 5th at a press conference the waldorf-astoria hotel, as a major breakthrough is the first time that a major animal had indeed been induced to get lung cancer from smoking cigarettes outside of map, outside of man that is correct animal I believe I said I also want to say that, a charge was level not only against Out product but a claim is made of the cigarette industry as the result of these experiments should assess its advertising policies and its overall policy this was a serious charge against our industry and we were astounded frankly after 25 years of negative results to find that the American Cancer Society could come up with this result, so we directed a letter to the Kansas side of we directed four letters to that we were also surprised that this procedure the Press coverage of the waldorf-astoria hotel because normally on a matter of this consequence, the medical profession goes through the discipline of submitting it to a medical journal it's then either accepted or rejected by the journal and this gives it a much more appropriate foundation for accuracy we thought in view of the charges made against our product and the fact that we were asked to reassess our policies that we were entitled for an independent review of the of the facts the slides methodology and whether or not goodness, it was really good research the Cancer Society refused to let us do this, even the New York Times supporters in this particular Endeavor they said that the can study should let us do this and finally we understood that the paper the Outback Hammond paper was submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Association this was after it had been turned down by the New England medical journal we were very interested I think we ought explain why it was turned on by the New England Journal it was turned down simply because it had been released ahead of time that was a policy doesn't that indicate this was not, proper procedure but it in no way reflects on the accuracy or enact no I didn't mean to imply that I'd like to say further that the Journal of the American Medical Association submitted this paper to 18 reviewers 17 of 18 review is rejected the paper and was sent back for major revisions now on the day of that submission when we finally found that out these gentlemen appeared in Chicago, and we found their position had been materially changed we also found their position had been maturely changed when we finally did get hold of a document in its final form as accepted by The Archives and of environmental health Minister Yuval I will I will tell you that but I believe you know that but I will say that as I see it, originally the our bank Hammond reports stated that for the first time and a major experimental animal, lung cancer had indeed been induced by cigarettes, and they claim that 12 dogs got cancerous tumors, in the final paper that was appeared in The Archives of environmental health they no longer claim with the purpose of the experiment was to determine whether cigarette smoke could induced lung cancer and bagels and they'll oh no longer claim that they did get those results are no longer claim that they got lung cancer from smoking cigarettes those are two very major changes and they reduce the number of doors, goes from 12 dogs to two dogs and I am still challenging the Cancer Society I have a letter on the record asking them to demonstrate to us whether or not those two dogs did indeed get Logan's on that point I happen to have a paper here which paper the one that finally appeared on the archives of environmental health and they refer to 12 dogs dogs who have invasive lung tumors two of which were identified, defied of carcinoma and the rest or invasive lung tumors invasive lung tumors does not mean lung cancers it is a matter of small Comfort to that difference well there are many tumors that can be developed in many people and we try to face it, that I wouldn't existence would you like to have an invasive lung tumor I don't believe so I don't think you would but that does not mean it's lung cancer no that's not what they say they will measure with to do it do it Chu was developed in the dog that didn't smoke that's in that report to non-invasive tool to non-invasive non invasive tumors that's a technicality I don't really feel confident that an invasive tumor is one which leaves the site which it originates and goes, to other tissues joining that site now these were invasive lovely thank Hoover Orton thing here is the dead change they did not claim as the originally claimed that they got any lung cancers from smoking cigarette you'll note if you read that carefully it does not claim that even if they were invasive lung tumors and even if that is undesirable thing which apparently it sounds like today this was no this is not claim to be the result, of cigarette smoking that's clearly omitted from their final report just common don't agree with that it seems to me that the statement says that not only is it associated with smoking but that it is less in dogs who smoked filter cigarettes it's related associated with smoking Mr Hammond does not mean, a lot of things that may be associated with a lot of things wrong I've been reporting science for a long time and it takes a great deal of information to establish what a Layman would consider to be a cause-and-effect relationship but I would say this that a scientist and his care generally says associated with and if you feel that cigarette smoking being associated with invasive lung tumors is not a Cause, well that's your opinion let's come around like you exhale us all from the lungs for for a couple of minutes and why one quick one and then I want to get to an area involving the promotion of cigarettes to women in an ad that you ran a newspapers December 1 I believe you said that you had spent 35 million dollars to support independent research I'd like to know whether you've ever spent anything the industry I say you want to help, those millions of people I believe there are millions I can't prove it who would like to quit smoking and who may be told by their doctors that they better quit smoking what are you spending on ways to finding ways to make tobacco tobacco cigarette smoking less addictive, well those are really two questions I think this immense as you quiz we have no program that I know of to try to help people to stop smoking we do talk to the question of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous we do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous we don't accept that but we are working with the government working very very hard with the government and various methods of ascertaining whether or not cigarettes, can be found to be hazardous you believe that cigarettes are safe and they've been proved to be Satan's to come I believe they have not been proved to be unsafe while in view of the fact that they haven't been proved to be safe what does it justification that you would offer for spending according to one estimate I've seen three billion dollars in the last 20 years to promote their use when there's that uncertainty when we have an excess excess deaths of 200,000 to 300,000 a year when there's all this, evidence which you don't feel as conclusive what is the reason for promoting its use when it might, cause cancer heart disease and so forth well I'd have to answer that This Woman's to answer a great many people in the United States and all over the world who would enjoy smoking who find it satisfies a very important human need, we think that those people are entitled to the best possible products that we can produce that is essentially our job and what we now embryos don't have much Choice fetuses don't they don't like to smoke the British medical research council did a study of all of the 17,000 babies born in a single week in the United Kingdom as you doubtless know the council found that those, babies born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy we're in significantly higher proportion small weighing under five and a half pounds approximately then the babies born to mothers who did not smoke and there was a higher rate of stillbirths and of deaths within 28 days of birth the question is in view of this study which is the largest and most elaborate of its kind ever made is it right, to promote smoking among women with Virginia Slims and the other brands especially marketed for them with no warning as to the danger of the embryo that may exist you're reading that question that goes it's a complicated question and I would say that I did read that report and I concluded from that report that it's true the baby's born from women who smoke are smaller but they're just as healthy as the baby's born from women who do not smoke, some women would prefer having smaller babies that I don't I don't know if familiar with that mr. Coleman every book on pharmacology identifies nicotine as a drug and with regard to the use of any drug it makes little difference as far as pharmacological definition is concerned whether you injected inhale it sniff it what take it by mouth, now under the laws of this country a manufacturer of a drug has the duty and obligation to prove that it's safe now only to prove that it's safe but to prove that it's efficacious namely that it does what it's supposed to do if indeed cigarettes are drugs within the meaning of the pharmacological turns if not the legal terms isn't it incumbent upon the cigarette companies to prove without exception that cigarettes are safe and not to Simply say prove that it's dangerous, well I think mr. you built this case your premise is wrong I really have to refer to the surgeon general's advisory committee report that report stated categorically the cigarettes are not addictive I didn't say that they were addicted I said that nicotine is a drug within the meaning of a term of drug in a chemically they went it's more important for the industry to take the word of the surgeon general's committee they said that cigarettes are not addicted I didn't talk about addiction, said that nicotine is a drug that means that it is a chemical which when taken into the body produces physiological changes whether it's a dick of a not as another property I'm talking about its being a girl here again the surgeon general's committee largely exonerated nicotine is a health hazard of any consequence to the public I have to glean on that after all the surgeon general's committee met for 9 months or longer and they can they concluded that nicotine is not a hazard to help do you have any problem in leaning on the, the surgeon general's report in some directions and denying it another directions no I don't frankly have about two minutes left Surgeon General report concluded that smoking is a health hazard of sufficient consequence to take appropriate remedial action and the Congress has responded to that but I want to remind you that the Congress in its premise in its preamble to the, law that bans cigarette advertising stated that in order to inform the public that cigarette smoking may be hazardous to health the following law is enacted I also want to say an answer to mr. you bail and mr. Mintz they've asked me some very searching questions I hate this popped out you guys me some very intelligent Grand a 13-foot I just want to say that, at the surgeon the surgeon general's report made of candy with certain certain conclusion that is true but there are many other developments subsequent of that and we had these, hearings for almost two weeks before the Congressional Committee of the house 14 days eminent scientists appeared on both sides that Committee of the Congress decided that there is nothing new in the smoking and health relationship since the hearings of 65 accepted both sides are supported by a larger statistical base and that's our opinion, I have about 20 seconds left you have two grandsons I believe we're at least two grandchildren at what age will you encourage them to start smoking cigarettes I wouldn't encourage them to start smoking cigarettes up to them okay thank you very much for being with us here today thank you mr.

fsph0257,"hello my name is dr. Jeff Gordon I'm the director of pain management and palliative care at the angle would hospital and Medical Center in Englewood New Jersey and also a clinical instructor of anesthesiology at the Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai I want to welcome you to our program entitled evolving rolls same goals the changing landscape of pain management, judgment, before we get started I'd like to take this opportunity to have our faculty introduce themselves dr. Hargrove why don't you start us off, I'm Charles our golf professor of Neurology at Albany Medical College and director of the Comprehensive Pain Center at Albany Medical Center in Albany New York, dr. arkov will present how a multi-faceted approach can help address opioid abuse and dr. Michael are Brandon will discuss developing abuse deterrent opioids dr. Brennan I'm Michael Brennan I'm the medical director and chief medical officer of the pain center of Fairfield and Fairfield Connecticut I'm also associate medical director for the chronic pain and Recovery Center at Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan Connecticut I also want to let you our audience know that this program was developed by Teva, articles that the three of us are presenting on behalf of Teva and that we've been compensated by Teva to give this presentation over the course of this program we will discuss some of the issues we all deal with on a day-to-day basis when managing pain specifically we'll take a look at treatment options focusing on opioids as we all know opioids are used to treat pain but abuse can occur as such it's important that we as clinicians understand when and how to use them, we will also examine a multi-faceted approach to addressing issues associated with opioids and how Healthcare professionals patients and the government can also play a role finally we'll take a look at how the development of abuse deterrent opioids may play a role in this multifaceted methodology taking information from the 2015 FDA guidance on this topic, I would like to begin this program by talking about some of those day-to-day challenges of practitioner May face when it comes to pain management chronic pain constitutes a significant medical need in the United States we recognize that patients are living longer with chronic illnesses surviving their trauma or cancer and as a result may also be experiencing chronic pain, we know that chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans and cost this country a significant amount of money estimated at over 600 billion dollars annually in direct costs and lost productivity and we know that there's a cost to patients as well that chronic pain May impair routine activities, now we know there are a few choices for analgesic medications and opioid analgesics represent an important tool in our treatment Arsenal, unfortunately with the expanding use of opioid analgesics an epidemic of prescription opioid abuse has resulted one of the challenges for those of us who treat pain patients has been how to utilize these important analgesics safely and effectively and what we recognize is that there is no simple solution a multi-faceted approach is needed to make sure that pain management is adequately provided to patients who need it while we also deal with the issues such as abuse misuse, use and diversion of these substances we have developed strategies to deal with opioid abuse most notably focused around educating the many parties involved the pharmaceutical industry has also stepped up and is trying to play a role in preventing the misuse and abuse of prescription analgesic medications one way that they have done this is through the development of abuse deterrent formulations for opioids, and any time we treat pain patients as clinicians we need to recognize the balance in our treatments, so we have to provide patients with adequate analgesia but minimize the Adverse Events associated with those medications and not just the physiological adverse effects but also the adverse effects of opioid abuse misuse and or diversion, I mentioned before that opioids are certainly an important analgesic option for pain management this has been recognized over time if you look at this chart starting in the early 1990s taking us up to 2013 you could see that there has been a slow yet Progressive increase in the amount of opioids dispensed by retail pharmacies in the United States again this has to do with our improved abilities to assess pain and our willingness to treat chronic pain with, a treatment regimen that includes opioids unfortunately the greater volume of opioid analgesics has also resulted in issues related to misuse abuse and diversion of these important analgesics, Beyond increased misuse and diversion there has also been an increase in deaths due to drug overdose, as you can see in this chart prescription opioids outrank both heroin and cocaine combined as a cause of drug overdose deaths here in the United States, looking at the slope of these curves you see that drug overdose deaths due to prescription opioid use has outpaced heroin and cocaine over the last 10 years or so highlighting the need to develop strategies to prevent prescription opioid misuse and abuse David fish beIN a psychiatrist and Pain Management specialist from the University of Miami conducted an evidence-based review of The Chronic pain literature focusing on patients with non-cancer and, ligament pain who were receiving chronic opioid analgesic therapy he looked at 67 different studies that evaluated the abuse or addiction rate aberrant drug related behaviors and urine toxicology testing and what he found is that only three point two seven percent of patients being treated with chronic opioid therapy had a high likelihood of abuse or addiction with their opioid analgesics, most notably he found that 25 times lower rate of abuse or Addiction in patients who didn't have a prior history of abuse or addiction, this is an important data set for us to recognize that the risk is clearly greater in patients with a previous history of abuse or addiction and that it's relatively low for patients with chronic non-malignant pain who don't have a previous history of addiction we all know that the most common initial source of opioids for non-medical use comes from a friend or family member for free but as the frequency of non-medical use increases the opioid becomes more likely to, I'm from a clinician highlighting the need for us to educate and reinforce to our patients how to use their medication appropriately, this brings us to the end of our discussion on some of the complexities clinicians face in pain management and I hope you found this chapter informative please return to the main menu and select the next chapter to hear dr. our golf tell you more about the role that clinicians and others can play in addressing opioid abuse,I'm Charles our golf professor of Neurology at Albany Medical College and director of the Comprehensive Pain Center at Albany Medical Center in Albany New York in the previous chapter you heard dr. Jeff Gordon discuss some of the challenges we faced with balancing the need for Effective pain management with some of the dangers of prescription opioid use to continue this conversation I'll focus on how we can help address opioid abuse with a, OT faceted approach, there are many approaches to mitigate opioid abuse and I would like to divide them into three main buckets first its education that ensures clinicians understand how to screen monitor and manage patients appropriately with opioid therapy this can also be combined with patient education on adherence to a treatment regimen as well as appropriate storage and disposal of opioids, second is the availability and use of tools that can help us guide the approach to managing a person an opioid therapy for example prescription drug monitoring programs which have been developed in almost every state help us as clinicians see what Controlled Substances our patients are currently being prescribed we have also had scheduling changes regarding certain opioids we have risk evaluation and mitigation strategies or Rems programs to help us guard against opioid, abuse changes to opioid labeling and guidance from the FDA on developing abuse deterrent formulations, the FDA guidance outlines how abuse to turn properties can be tested and what statements the FDA might allow in a product's package insert based on study results, it's important to recognize that there are multiple stakeholders who are involved in addressing opioid abuse and it is necessary for there to be a collaborative approach among these groups these groups include Healthcare professionals who are currently involved in managing patient care the patients themselves state and federal government entities as well as industry to promote safe and effective pain management we can incorporate a multi-faceted approach among all parties to, noise and mitigate the risks associated with opioid use, Healthcare Providers can play a role by following universal precautions incorporating screening strategies and monitoring patient adherence to prescription opioids some of the elements of universal precautions are outlined here and include establishing a diagnosis incorporating the use of a treatment agreement periodic pain assessments reviewing the diagnosis and of course ensuring appropriate documentation, in terms of screening there are various instruments that we can use as Healthcare Providers to identify the risk of opioid abuse in our patients and some of them are listed here we also have adherence monitoring approaches State specific prescription drug monitoring programs provide us with some insight into the use of opioids by a particular patient but these may vary widely between states, random drug screens are important random urine drug screens may be a way of confirming or evaluating adherence for the people to whom we prescribe medications as is pill counting to see whether it appears at the person who are prescribing the medication to is actually using it in a way that we have prescribed it and is adhering to that regimen, keep in mind even though we might consider any of our patients to be low risk for opioid abuse no patient has zero risk as health care providers we are the front line against opioid abuse and as such we need to use multiple methods to support safe and effective use of the treatments we prescribe, the patient has responsibilities as well which we can help through patient education for example we can help the patient understand how to safely use store and dispose of opioids from a safe use point of view we can encourage our patients to take their medications as prescribed to understand the risks associated with chronic opioid therapy and to be aware of inappropriate use and its consequences from a safe storage point of view, we don't want a person's opioid therapy to be accessible to their children or other family members just a single dose can be very dangerous as someone who is not supposed to be using an opioid analgesic so opioids should be locked or hidden to avoid access by family or friend and of course our patients need to know never to share their opioids with others because again a single dose can be regrettably but real, Stickley catastrophic with respect to adverse outcomes including death, safe disposal is also very important there are an increasing number of community sponsored take-back programs so opioids in a particular community may be disposed of through this approach and if that's not available the office of drug control National policy recommendations have been established and can be accessed to allow for an environmentally friendly disposal approach to these medications, so what exactly is a prescription drug monitoring program or pdmp for short, by definition it is a Statewide electronic database and it is designed to collect data on substances dispensed in that particular state it is housed within a designated state agency so could be a regulatory administrative or law enforcement agency this may vary from state to state and it's accessible only by authorized Personnel what are the potential benefits well this is a program that allows us to see what Controlled Substances a, Pacific patient may be receiving in that state and in that way it helps to support legitimate access to controlled substances, pdmps may also be able to help identify and deter drug abuse and diversion they may be able to facilitate identification and treatment of those addicted to prescription drugs by detecting certain patterns which can be very helpful in cases where addiction is not obvious they also allow you to establish it you will be monitoring every patients opioid use patterns, they may provide use and abuse data to support Public Health efforts to help educate all of us especially our patients on how to effectively use medications and how we can all play a role in limiting abuse and hopefully reduce diversion, as you see Missouri is the only state currently without an enacted prescription drug monitoring program and most other states have an operational prescription drug monitoring program pdmps vary state by state but in general they are all constructed to help clinicians understand how patients use prescription opioids which may then impact are prescribing Behavior, this can be used to help reduce Doctor shopping and to promote greater transparency it's also fair to say that the full benefit of prescription drug monitoring programs will not be reached until all states Implement data sharing and interoperability between each other to ensure transparency of opioid use across state lines, those of you with patients on Medicaid may be aware of its lock-in program which provides some ideas on how to limit abuse as well, federal law allows Medicaid to restrict patients who over utilize Medicaid services to designated providers it does so by requiring a patient to be seen by one health care provider and obtain their prescriptions from a single Pharmacy, the purpose of this is to empower a single provided to coordinate care to reduce doctor and Pharmacy shopping to limit drug diversion and to reduce Health Care utilization and Pharmacy cost, in the future this model may be adopted by other governmental payers be on Medicaid and even by private insurers as well to accomplish the same goals, as we alluded to earlier Controlled Substances scheduling of opioids can also help address prescription opioid abuse as you know the lower the number the higher the potential for abuse and dependence hydrocodone products were rescheduled from schedule 3 to schedule to in late 2014 which makes the process of obtaining a prescription and refills somewhat more difficult, the US Food and Drug Administration has also established a series of steps designed to help reduce opioid related risks and these are known collectively as opioid risk evaluation and mitigation strategies or Rems, they include the establishment of a medication guide or patient package inserts, a communication plan one or more elements to assure safe use and implementation system and a timetable for reporting the rims assessments to see if these strategies have been effective or not, Rems programs differ by opioid class for example immediate release opioids do not require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program / FDA guidelines the trans mucosal immediate-release fentanyl products or turst do involve a Rams program and practitioner and manufacturer participation is mandatory with access restricted to prescribers who have completed certain educational activities and have scored successfully on, an examination, in other words not everyone with a DEA number can prescribe these medications there has to be an additional set of educational activity before that can happen, with extended release and long-acting opioid therapy participation in the Rems program is not mandatory for the practitioner and access is not restricted to prescribers who have fulfilled certain criteria, the federal government through the FDA can also change what's in the package insert of a product here you see some changes in the package inserts of extended-release opioids that were implemented in 2013 as you can see the indication itself for extended release and long-acting opioids has changed in two ways the first change specifies that extended release or long-acting opioids are indicated for management of pain severe enough, to require daily around-the-clock long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatments are inadequate the second chain states that these agents should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options for example non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids are ineffective not tolerated or otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain there are also post marketing studies the FDA, now requires the FDA specifically is requiring new studies to further assess the known serious risks of misuse abuse and increase into tivity to pain sometimes known as hyperalgesia addiction overdose and death finally there is also a new box warning that states quote chronic maternal use of these products during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome or now's close quote, to summarize we need to really consider a multi-faceted approach to addressing opioid abuse the key stakeholders in this multifaceted approach include Healthcare Providers patients government as well as industry as we discussed healthcare provider strategies for mitigating opioid abuse include universal precautions screening for drug abuse and abuse risk urine testing and adherence monitoring, patients should also be educated specifically on the methods and importance of safe use safe storage and safe disposal of opioids, the federal and state government have developed and continue to develop programs aimed at making opioid diversion and abuse more difficult and less likely including the use of prescription drug monitoring programs the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy programs or Rams and labeling changes I hope you enjoyed this chapter the program and better understand the role that Health Care Providers patients and the government play in a multi-faceted abuse mitigation strategy, she industry may play a role in helping mitigate opioid abuse to tell you a little more about this and the potential role of abuse deterrent opioids please watch the final chapter in this series presented by dr. Michael Brennan,I'm Michael Brennan and I'm the medical director and chief medical officer of the pain center of Fairfield and Fairfield Connecticut I'm also associate medical director for the chronic pain and Recovery Center at Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan Connecticut, over the previous chapters in this program you heard about some of the issues associated with opioid use and how Healthcare Providers patients and the government can help reduce risks associated with opioid therapy now I'm going to tell you about the potential role that the pharmaceutical industry might play in mitigating opioid abuse specifically through the development of abuse deterrent opioids, you'll see that there are seven General approaches that have been recognized by the FDA as categories of abuse deterrent opioids these include physical chemical barriers Agonist antagonist combinations a version substances added to the analgesic delivery system characteristics new molecular entities and prodrugs combination approaches and novel approaches regardless of the different approaches to these formulations keep in, that all of these products share one important commonality when the medication is taken as directed or intended the opioid works like a medication that does not include abuse to turn properties it's only when the formulation is tampered with that the abuse to turn properties become evidence so that's the technical issue right creating a drug that will work for pain but at the same time making it difficult for somebody to want to abuse that drug, or make abusing the drug less beneficial, so where does the industry get their guidance there was a guiding principle document that was published by the FDA in April 2015 I'm going to provide you with an overview of what's contained within the guidance for developing abuse deterrent opioid formulations, there are four study categories that can be used to assess the potential abuse to turn properties of an opioid and as we get into the types of abuse to turn Technologies it'll become clear that certain Technologies may meet one type of study and prove beneficial but not necessarily a different type the first group of studies our laboratory manipulation and extraction studies these determine if tampering with the drug can override the formulation and provide a, access to the unadulterated opioid the next a pharmacokinetic studies these studies look at how the abuse to turn properties exert an effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug and after the drug has been manipulated in the lab if there is an alteration in that pharmacokinetic profile, examples of such alterations may include changes in BIO availability of the drug or changes to Peak plasma concentration the third type of test is the clinical abuse potential study, these are studies that look to see how attractive or light by recreational drug users the drug is in its unaltered and Altered States finally and perhaps the greatest hurdle will be the post Market studies has there been a demonstrable reduction in abuse based upon the availability of a certain drug in the market as you can imagine it's going to take several years to determine if there has been an effect, now there are different categories of labeling statements that may be proposed for the package insert and these depend on the results of the studies conducted, let's look carefully at the manipulation studies that have been outlined by the FDA the goal of this type of study is to see through physical or chemical manipulation if a drug can be easily extracted from the formulation, these studies look at particle size and determine if a small enough particle of active drug can be extracted through the various methods including crushing grinding hammering chemical reactions and changing temperature in other words think of whatever a closet chemist might try to do to get that active drug out of the delivery system let me emphasize this again remember the molecules were using are the same 13 or so molecules that are available in the, United States that are deemed opioid analgesics so it's not the molecule itself that's being evaluated what we're looking at are the formulations carrying those molecules can those formulations protect and make it so the drug is more difficult to be used in ways other than intended and the studies also include is I mention solubility studies and we're trying to Target three specific means of abuse snorting smoking and injecting, why are these three the types mentioned by the FDA because these are the approaches more often linked to substance abuse and addiction, the second type of study that I mentioned earlier PK studies so for those of you who can remember back to medical school pharmacokinetics look at how a drug acts in the system by looking at plasma concentration so we're interested in looking at maximum plasma concentration the time to reach this maximum the total area under the curve a relevant partial area under the curve which we think is very important in substance abuse that is how quickly does the drug get absorbed and watch the terminal elimination half, if life was very important in these trials is to try and understand if manipulation of the drug has an effect on the rate of Rise of drug concentration we want to determine if other substances benign substances food alcohol water other common Solutions such as soda might affect the way the drug is ultimately absorbed and also collect Adverse Events let's take a look at what are known in the guidance as C AP or clinical abuse, initial studies these are what we use to refer to as the human abuse liability potential of a drug measured in a way that many clinicians find interesting this involves exposing recreational non-dependent individuals to the opioid formulation using well-controlled studies so people who aren't physically dependent on an opioid but we'll use them recreationally and have enough experience to understand what the normal high of an opioid would feel like, and what the subjects are asked to do is tell us how much they like the drug so they're given a visual analog scale similar to this bipolar scale on a slide where the individual is asked after being exposed to the drug how much they like it or dislike it and they're ask questions questions that you and I won't ask in our clinics I mean we may ask our patients about Adverse Events but here we're trying to tease out different information from these recreational drug abusers and then the all-important question, kitchen How likely are you to use this drug if you can get it, the fourth category describes post-market studies to be conducted in order to examine if a formulation is likely to decrease abuse in the community the goals are to try and provide estimates of how the drug is being abused whether it's being snorted or injected and has this formulation demonstrated a reduction in abuse these studies require sufficient numbers to determine whether or not there is a real or an artificial affect and as such study populations, you're going to have to be carefully selected to Target real-world abusers comparators will also be looked at to see if changes are due to the formulation or other factors like educational programs or changes in law enforcement there will also likely be other opioid comparators as part of these studies, now that we've reviewed the studies that may be conducted to test and abuse deterrent opioid formulation let's switch gears and look at some of the different approaches perhaps the most common form of abuse to turn is the crush resistant pill in capsules all of these have in common a process that makes it very difficult to crush the pill or as we see in the bottom right picture on this slide a pill that if crushed becomes a viscous or gelatinous substance that's very difficult if not impossible to draw up in a syringe or to snort, here we see a different approach which is the use of Agonist antagonist combinations for example in a medication with a sequestered opioid antagonist core the antagonist will only be released if the formulation is manipulated with any of these strategies we have to remember that no technology can completely prevent abuse only time will tell if these Technologies are successful in helping to deter abuse in summary different approaches to opioid deterrence, continue to evolve this is a very exciting science and a very exciting time to offer our patients drugs that may make the abuse of their drugs more difficult it will take time to work through the testing especially for post-market studies but as these studies are completed and reviewed by the FDA abuse to turn opioids may be able to include language in their package inserts to let clinicians know what effect the formulation is likely to have on abuse and abuse potential which will ultimately help us make better informed, form decisions for our patients, thank you for watching this chapter on the development of abuse the turn opioids if you haven't already please be sure to return to the main menu to watch the other

fxxb0079,"new smokeless cigarettes have already been the focus of criticism but now the controversy has a new egg it produces the the pleasure and and what the smoker wants from a cigarette without burning tobacco Premier is nothing more than a sophisticated mechanism for delivering a highly addictive drug in that snake to nicotine good evening I'm Ted Koppel and this is Nightline r.j. Reynolds is, prepared to spend up to a billion dollars to develop and Market smokeless cigarettes now government researchers say smokeless cigarettes can be used to ingest crack and should be banned we'll hear from both sides of this new battle in the smoking War tonight, this is ABC News Nightline reporting from Washington Ted Koppel r.j. Reynolds has not made it this far in the world of Commerce by deliberately flushing huge sums of money down the toilet so one must assume that they have expectations for their new almost smokeless cigarettes that are not immediately apparent to the untrained eye this is for one thing the first pack of cigarettes I've ever encountered, with its own pamphlet of instructions on the back it warns you not to smoke these cigarettes if they are bent crushed or damaged it concedes that you can light them with matches but equality butane lighter is recommended and current lighters it warns don't work the rest of the pamphlets suggests implies but never says that this is a safer cigarette the Surgeon General of the United States is unconvinced he calls it a drug delivery system that should be regulated by, by the federal government and that phrase drug delivery system apparently applies on more than one level we'll get to that shortly first a little background on how we have come to this from Nightline correspondent Judd Rose, sending the message was a lot easier when smoking was in step with Society in those days we were told that smoking man was manly Viceroy the thinking man's filter and the Smoking Man of taste we were told that smoking was romantic with the use of living if you know easy it is to keep a man happy why not give your husband a carton of Philip Morris cigarettes we were even supposed to think smoking was good for us when you change too far, all right you will feel better did you say I'll feel better smoking Philip Morris what America grew skeptical as evidence mounted linking cigarettes with disease and death these days smoking is unfashionable and in many cases flat-out illegal so now the tobacco industry wants to sell us the smokeless cigarette all other cigarettes burnt tobacco this cigarette Premier does not it produces the the, pleasure and and and what the smoker wants from a cigarette without burning tobacco it merely Heats tobacco six years in the making developed and marketed at what's expected to cost 1 billion dollars tobacco giant r.j. Reynolds is hoping this is the future of cigarettes but even if there's no smoke there's plenty of fire Premier is nothing more than a sophisticated mechanism for delivering a highly addictive drug in that snake to nicotine it is also a mechanism by which others, liver other drugs if they so choose Premier is a cigarette it's marketed by RJ Reynolds for smoking taste and pleasure and the same way that the all other cigarettes made by the company are marketed for smoking taste and pleasure it's not a drug it's not a drug delivery device it's to be smoked for enjoyment by smokers judged by that standard alone Premier so far has been a resounding flop since October RJR has test marketed it in St Louis Phoenix and Tucson, despite heavy promotion sales have been very slow first it's strange it doesn't burn down there's no Ash it's hard to tell when it's out and it smells funny this is the only cigarette that comes with instructions on how to light it then there's the cost up to 30% more than regular cigarettes and as for the taste well this but has become the butt of jokes Jessica's molted it was horrible what did it taste like can you describe it like this open plant in Illinois, still Health officials are very worried that smokers who might otherwise quit will instead turn to Premier thinking it's better for them than conventional cigarettes the package does contain the federally required warning label but the ads call it the cleaner smoke which critics claim is just a left-handed way of saying safer smoke r.j. Reynolds has engaged in what I think is perhaps the most massive deceptive advertising campaign in the history of this country I think that statement is the most massive deception that that I'm aware of, of is it safer there's no claim that it's safer our advertising doesn't say that it's safer is it is what is it safer a safer cigarette you talking about your is no claim that it's safer and I I personally am not competent to evaluate the question RJR claims Premier does not produce the tars linked to lung cancer but critics say it does produce nicotine which is linked to high blood pressure heart attacks and strokes and health experts say it's sophisticated design actually gives the smoker a more direct nicotine hit, initially when you're like that the blast of nicotine you get is far in excess what you get for regular cigarette even the worst of the regular cigarettes so it is an effective nicotine delivery system a substance very addicted to young and old alike which is a major reason that I suspect the company wishes to produce it opponents including top federal health officials have banned together and asked the Food and Drug Administration to regulate perhaps even ban Premier I petitioned the FDA to, elated because I think it is a drug delivery system and you might like to know that my colleagues who work in drug addiction have found that that cigarette is a better drug delivery system in the laboratory than anything they have yet devised nicotine isn't the only drug at issue here scientists at the National Institute on drug abuse say that they tested one of these they found that in just one minute they were able to open it up and load it with crack cocaine writing in the current Journal of the American Medical Association the scientists say they have, machine smoke the altered Premier and found it to be a highly efficient way of smoking crack without anyone being the wiser we've seen test for that and the delivery efficiency is going to be so low that it will be wasteful for the crack abuser and he's not going to want to waste his way to his crack that way but what if that assumption is wrong people get cut with knives people get into accidents with automobiles guns kill people there A lot of products that can be, be put to Illegal uses or abused and lead to harm that's not necessarily the manufacturers fault what has to really ask the tobacco industry at this point where is your code of ethics where are your morals what are you doing to help us convince those 100,000 kids aged 12 and under each year in this country that utilizing your product is a major serious health hazard good Heavens have you no shame cigarettes have, in regulated by a federal health agency but the pressure is mounting on the FDA to regulate this one that could cripple premiers chances of success and be a devastating Financial blow to r.j. Reynolds and with domestic cigarette sales slumping already the entire tobacco industry may get burned by The Fallout from the smokeless cigarette Judd Rose for Nightline in Washington in a moment we'll hear both sides of the debate over this new cigarette as we talked with dr. John Slade one of the, leading critics of the Premier cigarette and Richard campy an official of the RJ Reynolds company this Avatar New York Studios is dr. John Slade one of the country's leading Specialists on smoking and addictive diseases last summer dr. Slade testified before Congress about the dangers of the RJ Reynolds Premier cigarette also with us in our Washington Bureau is the president of RJ Reynolds tobacco development company Richard can't be who oversaw the introduction of the Premier cigarette mr. campy why don't, begin with the question that your attorney felt himself in competent to answer is it a safer cigarette said we're not claiming that this is a safe or safer cigarette we recognize that there are a lot of issues and a lot of criticisms that have been made about cigarettes we certainly recognize that a controversy exists Premier was developed and introduced in response to that controversy a good deal of the controversy focuses around the byproducts of burning tobacco and all of the chemicals that are related or less, aged to be related to the smoking and health controversy Premier substantially reduces many of these controversial compounds and when you compare them to other low tar cigarettes you talking about reductions of 90 to 99 percent now mr. get a let's let's take these things one at a time nice and simply so that even I can understand it we're talking you were talking about a controversy which deals with a lot of chemicals that cause if One Believes the doctors and the American Medical Association in the Surgeon General, Seymour cancer and all those other nasty things like heart disease that we are familiar with if you are claiming that this cigarette has fewer of those nasty chemicals in it than the other cigarettes do then presumably it would be safe to infer that what you've developed is a safer cigarette what I don't understand is if that were the case why can't you say it while Ted the the issues with respect to Tobacco burning cigarettes results in a controversy there's a great deal of statistical Association, based upon epidemiological studies but in terms of hard conclusive proof in terms of laboratory inhalation studies with animals there still are questions all right so you would have no trouble then with my saying that Premier is not a safer cigarette so you've introduced it for some other reason we introduced it to respond to the controversy that's correct we're which part of the controversy are you talking about I'm talking about the things that have been cited the allegations that have been made people find things in tobacco smoke they, the only gatien's Mystic a if you'll forgive me the allegations have to do with this being an unsafe thing to engage in I'm talking about smoking tobacco cigarettes so if this is in response to those allegations why respond if your response doesn't produce a cigarette that safer but it does indeed Ted respond to so many of the issues we're not saying that this is a perfect product no I mean you got it does respond I'm not asking I'm not asking you whether it's a perfect product I'm not asking you whether this is as good as vitamin A or vitamin C for you I'm simply asking whether, of to Tobacco cigarettes this is safer and you don't seem to be able to handle their question why well I think I'd like to go back to what I know what you'd like to go back to what I'm asking you is why you can't handle the question well if you I think I did answer it earlier if you look at the the information that has been made available on Tobacco burning cigarettes we conclude that there is still a controversy that there are still issues that are unresolved but if you look at the issues that people have said indict cigarettes, many of those issues relate to these controversial compounds one of the one of the controversies is the one of the controversial compounds is nicotine right that's correct this cigarette doesn't reduce nicotine intake if one listens to what the doctors say apparently it more efficiently allows you to ingest nicotine that is absolutely untrue nicotine is absorbed it's metabolized it's eliminated and it's distributed in the body based on good sound scientific studies know differently, the nicotine found in tobacco burning cigarettes so this is the same as a tobacco burning cigarette insofar as nicotine is concerned once the nicotine level is less than 97% of all cigarettes sold in America I think it's about time that I went over to dr. slay the darkness lead insofar as the ingestion of nicotine is concerned do you accept what mr. Camp he just had to say with regard to its ingested by the body in the same fashion and therefore I guess you sing is no better or no worse well in part it's certainly used by the body in the same way once it's absorbed but, device this nicotine delivery system delivers the nicotine more efficiently and with much less irritation than a traditional cigarette does so it's potentially more addicting for a novice to start with because it's easier to inhale and easier to start with what do you mean by potentially more addictive well is it more addictive or is it that you don't know yet we don't know yet because Reynolds has had the product itself which is not an available to researchers and all we have are Reynolds animal, studies to draw inferences from and a couple of small human studies and what are they sure they show that this device is far less irritating than regular cigarettes for laboratory animals laboratory animals free this like they breathe room air and they really shut down their breathing when exposed to tobacco smoke well is not good well they know they find this very easy to inhale which means the nicotine gets into their bloodstream quite easily even without any practice with smoking then then dr. Slade why is the the nicotine, all that's in the blood plasma less than cigarettes that burnt tobacco the only system in which that's been tested is with the cigarette that has three times the delivery of the Premier the mr. campy mentioned a minute ago that this cigarette has a this device has a delivery of nicotine that's less than 97% of those in the market but it's in the middle ground of cigarettes if you compare it to traditional cigarettes that can be adjusted by the smoker, to deliver an addicting dose of nicotine the people can compensate to a huge degree what I mean by puffing harder I puffing Harder by taking longer Puffs by puffing more frequently and so there's a there's not any scientific reason so far to feel that this is any different than most cigarettes on the market as far as they could change deliveries concerned clear on this can't be we have to take a break I'll give you a chance to respond to that and then we will also take up this issue of whether this is a useful delivery system for the smoking of crack, a canned and how and why that whole controversy has arisen we'll continue our conversation in a moment, I'm mr. Richard campea the president of r.j. Reynolds development we were talking a moment ago about nicotine nicotine is an addictive drug as I don't know I don't accept the fact that nicotine is an addictive drug I didn't realize that that was an ambiguous question I thought that was a medical fact well if you take a look at the fact that 40 million Americans have chosen not to smoke 95% of those in their own free will without any assistance whatsoever it's awfully difficult to indict something like that is, being addictive we're going to a camp people have quit opium they've quit heroin there's no question that those are addictive drugs simply because someone has the strength of character to quit doesn't mean that what they quit wasn't addictive to begin with well I'm you know Ted you got to come back and take a look at the issue all cigarettes contain nicotine nicotine is a natural part of tobacco it's a natural flavoring ingredient Premier is a cigarette it contains tobacco and it also contains nicotine but at the issue is nicotine and the drug delivery device I think that that's outrageous, this is a cigarette by any definition if you asked a hundred consumers out there to look at this thing light it up I think that they would say it's a cigarette it's lit its inhaled it's exhaled it operates exactly like other cigarette except it doesn't have an ash it has about what I mean you would know precisely one-fifth one-sixth 1/10 the tobacco enter the regular cigarette it has about a third the tobacco of a regular cigarette but now it has approximately half the tobacco when you look at it on a cigarette by cigarette basis but the issue is whether or not this, this is a cigarette which responds to so many of the issues dr. Slade has been criticizing this industry and many anti-smoking zealots for the last 25 years they've said reduce the yields reduce the controversial compounds deal with environmental tobacco smoke here we develop a product that substantially reduces the controversial compounds virtually eliminates environmental tobacco smoke and now these people are saying Jesus product is wrong let's ban it it's not perfect it doesn't go all the way but God is a significant technological, breakthrough it's something that should be looked at reasonably an objectively let's let's talk for a moment well go ahead if you're dr. Slade if you want to respond to that but I do want to leave enough time so we're going to talk about this this allegation of it being usable as a crack smoking device go ahead yes as far as this being there's no question that this is an addictive drug and it's highly addictive and at least as much as cocaine and heroin are and can't mr. camping makes a point about reducing controversial compounds and answering criticisms, he didn't come and consult with health officials about whether we thought in 1989 this would be a good idea in the 1950s and the 1960s filter cigarettes and low tar cigarettes were introduced by the companies companies to allay fears and and keep people smoking to make it look safe to smoke and this is in the great tradition of low tar cigarettes and filter cigarettes dr. Slade why did the Surgeon General and his report asked that by the year 1990 that, cigarette manufacturers reduce the yields of their cigarettes this product goes beyond even that which is contemplated by him the reported by the year 2000 will there still be 40 million smokers has given by government figures by the center of Disease Control I mean there are 50 million Americans what do you want to say 3,000 trees to look like it's not written by the voter natives Alternatives which respond to the issue in the controversy just abandon them well what will hold on a sec what do you mean just abandon them you make it sound as though you keeping blood plasma way from people abandoned people, people so that they can smoke cigarettes is I'm sanding them in terms of providing alternatives to because they're hopelessly addicted to nicotine know if there are 50 million Americans who choose to smoke and if the government even by its own calculations when we're supposed to have a smoke free Society by the year 2000 says that they'll be some 40 million Americans that smoke isn't it not in all of our best interest to develop products technologically that deal with some of these issues it certainly some of the compounds it certainly is no rentals best interest but I think that, we can develop public health systems that help it eat make it easier for people to stop smoking gentleman we've got to take a break and I promise when we come back we will focus the last couple of minutes on the business of cracked delivery will continue in a moment, dr. Slade I'm prepared to be as cynical as the next fellow about the motives of the tobacco industry but surely not you not anyone is suggesting that they have deliberately developed a cigarette the the inside a little metal core of which can be used for the smoking of crack that's been a concern of a lot of my colleagues in the addictions treatment field ever since we saw the preliminary drawings of this last spring that they deliberately did it know that it's possible to do, I don't think at all that this is their intent on how I mean they'll surely can't be held to account for that anymore as someone from RJ Reynolds suggested in the earlier piece anymore than someone who you know makes a knife can be held responsible for someone using it for illicit purposes not talking about responsibility is talking about the potential problem a potential difficulty with what do you think they're going to do about it, I think that the FDA ought to regulate this product as a drug and that this is one of the elements that ought to be considered in sorting out what the potential problems are with this device mr. camping Ted I know and response to dr. Slade I think the whole issue is is ridiculous I think it is being used for the political lens to try to get this product band if you looked at the tests that we're done and the article that was submitted in support of this this assertion an individual would have, smoke a continuous puff for between five and seven minutes and even then they wouldn't get any efficient yield I know very few people who can take a puff and hold a continuously for five to seven minutes as the tests done would suggest an are wearing I think is too emotional eyes the issue but let me just say I'm going to ask you the question of the very emotional fashion if I put a little piece of crack inside one of those cigarettes and gave it to her you would without any hesitation take a puff right I would, I'm asking you now you're not intentionally put any crack into a no no but I mean the cigarette what I'm what I'm asking you is if in fact your contention is correct that no one's going to get any kind of high from this unless they unless they can inhale for a solid five minutes you wouldn't have any problem putting a little piece of crack in their lighting it up and taking a puff would you now I can't I'm not an expert on drugs but we have gone to we went to Francis Mullen he's an extra executive director of the FBI and also is involved with the drug enforcement agency as a group administrator I mean told your work he says that the whole idea, is preposterous there are such other easier method it's not Preposterous and not me it's either easier methods and you can take aluminum cans getting far more efficient yield these people are talking experiment that doctor hitting field and his colleague at night I did do a quarter they were trying to answer the question was it possible for this to deliver crack and they found that it was they weren't trying to duplicate human situations but Reynolds for the last six months has been saying it can't be done and now in this simple experiment, using a system that used with marijuana and tobacco to duplicate useful biological effects they have shown that it can be done all right I'll tell you what I don't want to go over on this program tonight we're in danger of doing that right now but mr. campy I don't want to leave it this Ambiguously and I do want to leave you the last word on that point go ahead make whatever closing comment you want to make on the issue of its use as a crack smoking device well when you follow the experiment the dr. slay just referred to you've got to heat the system beyond the point that the product can't even take it, physically degrades when you look at what happens you burning it at temperatures of over 350 degrees don't know what you're holding in that vial well these are cigarettes that have decomposed as a result of putting it through the same experiment the dr. slay just reported about you're asking a machine to smoke a product for 7 minutes and then you saying that that indeed is the way that a human would smoke in order to extract crack it's a total abuse of the product and it's not even a reasonable way in which it would be done I don't know if somebody who could do that they're beginning to be case reports of people using this too, Vice in just that way all right I'll tell you what on that slightly ambiguous know what I'm afraid I'm going to have to thank you both we have gone a few seconds Beyond are normally a lot of time I hope our Affiliates will excuse us for that I want to thank you mr. campy dr.

fyhb0039,"Eclipse primarily heat rather than Burns tobacco it reduces secondhand smoke by nearly 90%, Aunt doesn't leave any lingering odor and produces virtually no messy ashes it reduces staining on Fabrics such as curtains drapes wallcoverings and it's also low in time nicotine with a smooth Rich tobacco taste, eclipse is clearly what many smokers have been calling for first and foremost they want a good-tasting cigarette but they also want a cigarette that reduces secondhand smoke to address many of the hassles that they feel in today's society with a Clips are Jr.'s developed exactly what many smokers have told us that they're looking for, well they're in our research in Chattanooga over the past few weeks the response to Eclipse has been very encouraging thousands of adult smokers in the Chattanooga area have tried eclipse and a lot of them have told us that they're very interested in buying it on a regular basis retailers of also told list that many of their customers are asking for Eclipse so we're moving to a full-scale test Market including retail availability and Chattanooga beginning June 3rd, we've heard thousands of positive comments from smokers and Chattanooga ranging from the lack of ashes and the lack of lingering cigarettes known their clothes and cars to the positive reaction that they get from non-smokers who are around them when they're smoking a Clips smokers have told us that they've waited a long time for a cigarette like this, our expectations for Eclipse are realistic we don't expect a Clips to appeal to every smoker and our research shows that it's not for every smoker but we are offering a significant new cigarette that many smokers have asked for and one that many smokers and those around them should like,The Cliffs looks like any other cigarette with one exception that's have to lay it in Eclipse has a small high Purity carbon tip that burns and sends warm air through the tobacco role inside the cigarette since the smoke from eclipse is mostly water and glycerin the smoke that is Exhale by the smoker dissipates very quickly and because only the very, tip of the cigarette Burns Eclipse doesn't burn down the way other cigarettes do and there's virtually no smoke off the lid end of the cigarette after the first few Puffs this results in an 85 to 89 percent reduction in second hand smoke compared to the leading cigarette brands, Eclipse primarily Heats tobacco instead of burning it that's the basis for its many benefits it it's made much like any other cigarette with a special difference a tip made from high Purity carbon this tip is wrapped in an insulating heat barrier that keeps the tobacco roll from burning down the rest of eclipse is just like other cigarettes a blend of flying tobacco followed by a regular cigarette filter, as you smoke your eclipse the heat barrier keeps the tobacco roll from burning down inside the cigarette instead when you draw warm air passes over the tobacco getting a just hot enough to create a full-bodied smoke that carries the flavor of the tobacco with it, smoke particles from other cigarettes are about twenty percent water and glycerin but Eclipse Smoke is the reverse about 80% water and Glycerine glycerine is something found in all cigarette smoke as well as many food products and baked goods based on Government testing methods full flavor cigarette Styles range between 15 and 20 milligrams of tar Lifestyles between 6 and 14 and ultralights between 1 and 5 mg but Eclipse which primarily Heats rather than, his tobacco is three milligrams in its full flavor style and to in its mild style for nicotine full flavor cigarettes typically range between point eight and one point seven milligrams of nicotine lights range between .6 and .9 and ultralights range between point 1 and point five but eclipses nicotine level is just point to mg in its full flavor and point one and it's mild Style, and like I said today we are here to talk about exciting you cigarette after marking miles back company called Eclipse now imagine a cigarette that produces almost, most 90% less secondhand smoke the lashes the lingering over practically no state now imagine a cigarette the produces almost 90% less secondhand smoke the lashes no lingering over practically no stain and it is an ultra low power in the cigarette eclipses a cigarette and like your cigarette it's got a filter it's got a roll of tobacco, rapping cigarette paper the difference between eclipse and all the sacraments is the eclipse has a high Purity carbon tip and a farrier okay it has all our Eclipse primarily heats the tobacco rather than burning it we Smokin Eclipse their travels through the tab across the tobacco getting just hot enough to release the flavor and create the smoke, all right, in a way I'll have to say I was skeptical because I thought not no you can't do that how you going to get it the back of flavor if the back tobacco itself doesn't burn, but the answer is in eclipse and they figured it out and I think it's a wonderful concept, well it meant I could smoke in the car because I generally can't smoke in the car because some people are offended by that if they get into my car smells like cigarettes they might not be real happy with me as an, agent and you have to be careful of something like that with the eclipse it really didn't matter they didn't know I was smoking in my car so there was no you know there's no odor so that means a lot to me,well when I first my first concept of it I thought that it's going to be you know basically not real flavorful cigarette I was really surprised, well I've never been one for causes I've never been involved in any demonstrations but the week I had the eclipse cigarettes I was sharing them with my smoking friends I was smoking around my non-smoking friends I was getting feedback from everyone that was around me and so I shared my cigarettes and I told everyone this is absolutely the greatest thing I mean I really believe in the cigarette, and I will buy them, I just noticed that the the owner is not in my house anymore because I used to smoke the regular cigarettes and I would come back in you know like say you would go out to the store or something like that in the house is are closed in any kind of that kind of like a musty odor you know and now with the eclipse and you walk into your house you don't have that musty odor anymore,Eclipse primarily hates tobacco instead of burning it that's the basis for its many benefits it it's made much like any other cigarette with a special difference a tip made from high Purity carbon this tip is wrapped in an insulating heat barrier that keeps the tobacco roll from burning down the rest of eclipse is just like other cigarettes a blend of fine tobacco followed by a regular cigarette filter, ER as you smoke your eclipse the heat barrier keeps the tobacco roll from burning down inside the cigarette instead when you draw warm air passes over the tobacco getting a just hot enough to create a full-bodied smoke it carries the flavor of the tobacco with it, smoke particles from other cigarettes are about twenty percent water and glycerin but a clip smoke is the reverse about 80% water and Glycerine glycerine is something found in all cigarette smoke as well as many food products and baked goods based on Government testing methods full flavor cigarette Styles range between 15 and 20 milligrams of tar light Styles between 6 and 14 and ultralights between 1 and 5 mg but Eclipse which primarily, beats rather than Burns tobacco is three milligrams in its full flavor style and to in its mild style for nicotine full flavor cigarettes typically range between point eight and one point seven milligrams of nicotine lights range between .6 and .9 and ultralights range between point 1 and point five but eclipses nicotine level is just point to mg and it's full flavor and point one and it's mild

fypj0015,"imagine a cigarette with smoke that disappears like this and smells like this imagine a cigarette that leaves no ashes, I'll leave your windows this clear introducing eclipsed by Vantage the cigarette that reduces secondhand smoke by 95% hi I'm Mark Elliott and I'm Carol maze we're part of the team introducing Eclipse around the country we'd like to take a few minutes to tell you about it it sounds impossible doesn't it cigarettes, smoke that's satisfying and full-bodied but leaves no odor no stains and practically no secondhand smoke I have to say I was a little skeptical at first look at the smoke when Carol exhales and see how fast it disappears next time you smoke your cigarettes see how long it takes for its smoke to disappear and look at this there is virtually no smoke off the lid end I mean you really have to try it to believe it so how does it work girl it's a pretty simple idea Eclipse primarily Heats, go instead of burning it inside it doesn't look very different but the way it works makes a big difference in the Smoke eclipse is made much like any other cigarette but it's got something special a tip made from high Purity carbon this tip is wrapped in an insulating heat barrier that keeps your eclipse from burning down so the tobacco doesn't burn the rest of the cigarette is a blend of fine tobacco's followed by a regular cigarette filter, when you light up your lighting the carbon tip so take an extra puff and a longer draw use a good flame a car lighter won't work very well once it's lit the carbon tip gets hot and stays hot until your eclipse is done as you smoke your eclipse the heat barrier keeps the tobacco from burning down inside the cigarette instead warm air passes over the tobacco getting it just hot enough to create a full-bodied smoke that carries the flavor of the tobacco with it, since it doesn't burn down Eclipse doesn't have any smoke coming off the lid end there's nothing added to the tobacco that isn't another cigarettes but the smoke is different right Mark right what Eclipse does is take common tobacco smoke and well turn it upside down smoke particles from other cigarettes are about twenty percent water and glycerin but Eclipse Smoke is the reverse about 85% water and Glycerine glycerine is something, found in all cigarette smoke as well as many food products such as cookies for example, now let's get down to brass tacks Mark what are the tar and nicotine numbers exactly well Carol let's take a look most full flavor Styles have between 14 and 20 milligrams of tar light Styles have between 7 and 13 milligrams of tar and ultra light cigarettes typically have between one and six milligrams in comparison Eclipse which Heats rather than Burns tobacco has about three milligrams of tar in its full flavor style and to and it's mild Style, as you know Carol all these tar levels come from methods the measure tar from cigarettes that burnt tobacco since Eclipse primarily Heats rather than Birds tobacco it's sort of like comparing apples to oranges that's right in fact with those methods the glycerin and eclipse is recorded as tar if they didn't include glycerin Eclipse would have at our level even less than 1 milligram, now looking at nicotine levels full flavor styles of other cigarettes typically contain between point eight and one point seven milligrams of nicotine lights range between .6 and .9 and ultralights range between point 1 and point five in comparison Eclipse has 0.1 milligrams of nicotine, and because Eclipse Smoke is mostly water and glycerin it has a smoother taste and disappears very fast kind of like your breath on a cold Winter's morning exactly this smoke combined with the fact that there's no smoke off the lid end is what gives Eclipse a 95 percent reduction in secondhand smoke right you know the way Eclipse works is something like making coffee, when you pour the hot water all the flavors release from the grounds the grounds are still there when you're finished but the flavor is gone so you throw them away, just as you do you're finished eclipse, you really notice the difference when we're both smoking the smoke doesn't build up in the room and you can be confident that smoke stains won't build up on your walls your windows your curtains even your teeth it takes a while to notice that Eclipse doesn't stain or build up but here's a way that you can see the difference right now, Mark's going to Exhale smoke from a leading light cigarette through some curtain fabric, notice the result, now he'll do the same with a clips, take a look at the difference, here's another thing about eclipses that's pretty amazing would you pass me the other a story Carol, because Eclipse doesn't burn down it doesn't leave any ashes if you put it down the tip keeps burning slowly but look at this if the cigarette somehow falls out of the ashtray it can lie flat on the table without burning it in fact eclipse is much less likely to start a fire than other cigarettes but be careful if the tip is still hot the tip Burns as long as any other cigarette about six to seven minutes so you get about the same number of Puffs as your regular brand just before eclipse, goes out you'll start getting less smoke The Taste gets weaker that's how you can tell your eclipse is finished now we've just enjoyed our cigarettes and all I can smell is the coffee it's great and everyone who comes in this room really know this is the difference but we've been talking long enough right well there's still a lot more about the eclipse begins let's hear from people all over America who had a chance to try a clips for a while and see its benefits, I thought the eclipse would either taste like absolutely nothing or it tastes really bad because it didn't burn like a normal cigarette Burns but I laughter I had an eclipse or two or three it wasn't you know I was kind of surprised it actually tastes more like a cigarette than I expected it to being a Salesman and I'm you know on the road in my car all day long smoking Eclipse you know cut down the stain on my windows and the smell of my clothes and in my hair and and being out dealing with the public, that's something nowadays that you have to worry about my friend that I walk with, I read their a drive to church or she dressed the church in when I smoke in her car she says I can't tell your smoking I can't smell it for me personally the key benefit of Clips is the lack of mess that's associated with cigarettes there's not the Ashes to clean up or we'll be all over the house and the windows in the house in the car don't have that Hayes on them and you don't have to clean up as much and I like that, occasionally go up to the bedroom or something to change I'll have a cigarette with me and next thing you know all your clothes smell like cigarette smoke with the eclipse you can't tell that you were even in the bedroom what's the eclipse it was great I could still do dishes and stuff and I didn't have this Burning cigarette burning up into my face and Ashes dropping in my food or on my laundry while I'm folding it I didn't have any qualms about smoking in the eclipse inside the house because, was there was no visible you know smoke anywhere and there was no smell it was it was a clean kind of cigarette I can't see any any reason why any smoker wouldn't switch to an eclipse I think if everyone smoked Eclipse smokers and non-smokers would probably get along a lot better than they ever have thanks for joining us and taking the time to learn about Eclipse not just another cigarette Eclipse let you recapture the pleasure of smoke, going with no odor no stains no Ash has practically no secondhand smoke and ultra low tar and nicotine all in a full-bodied an enjoyable taste Eclipse really is amazing and incredible new cigarette that gives you a new choice and a new freedom to enjoy smoking it's not impossible it's a clips and now it's time

fzgb0039,"okay, as you know we're going to wait on Janice is going to join us midstream, what I'm going to do is talk to you for about 45 minutes about your experience in the last three weeks you've participated in a study that started about three or four weeks ago study just concluded last week I think it was you've either been back here I've talked to somebody on the phone several times in the last few weeks and we're very interested now in this portion of the test is known as qualitative which is to try to get your attitude and opinions we know what you put down on the written questionnaire now we want to find out what's going on in your head about the product, what I want to start with though is if you could just for the record give us your name let us are you married do you have children that are in the house do you have grandchildren that are in the house do you live with a smoking spouse just a little bit about yourself Hobbies things like that okay I am married have two children a daughter 21 a son 15 they're both at home let me see my husband does smoke my children do not let me see I just quit, work well I worked at a daycare or six years and of course we weren't allowed to smoke inside daycare but I took breaks went outside you know away from the children right or they can influence the children right now I think I'm just trying to enjoy summer and, okay with my son and what you spoke as you use your breath okay Vantage ultra light Vantage Ultra Lights hmm okay how much do you smoke a day forth in the need to travel a little over a pay a little over yeah okay I'd say it to a pack and a half a day okay okay how about you said that your husband spoke with this he smoked Marlboro Lights Barbara let's Okay and we have he's what do you like to do I like to cross stitch I like to go fishing with, going camping some more and things like that one of the first things do you smoke in your house and used to okay and then we both quit smoking that stayed quiet for three years and it's are for this white sounds but by the time you get the wild wash down that you know what I'm talking about now so we'd sad then we would not smoke inside the house so we smoke outside okay so both you and your husband smoke outside, where do you smoke I had important porch yeah so this is a self-imposed restrictions yes if you find it difficult in doing that or are you pretty much used to that now pretty much used to it but boy when it's cold it's rough we're letting your car keys yes okay so you got it okay, there are smoking restrictions here in Chattanooga have started I don't know how well they enforce it because I'm not one of these people that, just bound and determined they eat other if they say I mean I do respect other people and not smoking other people's houses you know I think that's just a common courtesy I don't know that I agree with the mouth saying that because you're not smoking in the stores it was like damn you know outside but yeah there's just you know several now that's getting restrictions on them and of course I never have like I say I'm not one of these it's going to, sit there and try and force it you know good okay first question I have is it relates to when you came in here a few weeks ago you saw a demonstration of a new cigarette we're going to spend the rest of our time talking about the new cigarette various aspects about it tell me what do you remember about the demonstration what was the what was it like what were they talking about and it was a long time ago but okay well they showed us a family, and I've gotta admit it was hard to believe at the time you know talking about the film and the family would leave like I'm married you know that that's not going to happen now and I'll be truthful we did smoke those cigarettes inside our house people non-smokers that came in could not tell it okay so you have sin was very very pleased very special yeah even in the car because in the car you know crack the window, let's smoke away up we're going to talk about you and the reaction of others in what happened at home but back to that demonstration there was a there was a man and a woman that led the discussion what were the types of things that they were talking about the discussion what do you consider to be what do you remember the most was the most memorable part of that whole discussion okay well I had the chart about the lower tar and nicotine okay which was a big thing and then like I say even talking about you know you, I won't say that you don't have to be careful but not as careful just such as laying it down on the table whatever you know or if you dropped it the one thing I think that I didn't realize as much and they were talking about you know it was an adjustment for the cigarette right which is a big adjustment but yeah just talking about all the differences in it but I think a lot of it, yes and at the lower tar and nicotine in about filtering about how it heats up and it's not burning the tobacco okay so they talked a little bit about why it works the way yeah and I even cut one open okay you know and Shout a scene just look like dried yeah a rather than Barnes looked up to talking about how nice it is not to have the ashes hmm you know which to me non-smokers that's one of the, the big things you know besides the odor and they ashes is writing things okay for you remember to knock a lot what would you consider to be in that hour long discussion what would you consider to be the number one thing that you walked away from that thinking that this is important what do you read what is the the best recollection you have of that whole demonstration, I think the lower tar and nicotine was the big thing but I don't think I really quite, belief this is much then now I'll be truthful because this is fun so they had a time in the discussion for people to ask questions did you ask a question in the now we're sitting down here talking about couldn't believe that it wouldn't lie film only talking about how you didn't believe it you remember some of the questions that were asked, of course they were asking you know had we know that there's not something else in this cigarette that okay you're not telling us okay and I stress the fact that what is in that cigarette is no different than what is in your regular cigarette same factors just different ratios okay okay now I think is what 88 percent water and then 12% glycerin and, yeah the difference in they had and how it would be more like a vapour okay but yeah there was some I think skeptical about they and then of course you know talking about, the difference about not having to be, you know as careful with the regular cigarettes and the okay okay did you like the demonstration was there it was interesting but like I say it's, I think hard to believe you know you walk out thinking sure sure yeah got it what, then you had to try the product at the demonstration yes it has their own cigarettes do you cry what was your reaction to the first cigarette when you try to does it wanton Bay and it wasn't bad yeah it wasn't what I was expecting how is it different, okay, first of all I tried I smell cold fronts okay and I tried an ultra-light in his stupid is what this sounds it tasted stronger than mild mild your life okay okay so thinking and they did ask Dean 11 try men which I tried that one right there on the floor okay right okay to me the full flavor, and the ultralight in the new cigarette with not that much different because they weren't so I ended up smoke and when I did this I ended up smoking the for fly for flavor and do you recall a net is that the tar and nicotine the same or different the full flavor versus the what they were calling the mile, do you recall no okay no I really don't I was thinking it was the same that I maybe know you're actually right on that it is the same and they just taste a little bit different but you're right there they are very similar so it wasn't what you expected would you in you said it was okay with wizard worse than you expected better than you expected better was better okay what were you expecting, I don't think I really know what I was expecting because of all the benefits they were talking about, I don't think I really realized what it was I guess I expected it to taste like some of the basic cigarettes okay which I cannot stand that give me headaches okay and I guess I was expecting something along that line though I really was not expecting but the more you smoked of those the better you like them okay they you know it is an adjustment okay we're going out tonight okay we're good we're going to talk a lot about that, part of the the presentation used a videotape do you recall the videotape what were what were some of the things in the videotape if that all that you remember okay it was the main woman and they were talking about how it was like Steam and they had like the, once a coffee pot thing okay showing the steam that it would and then they would smoke cigarette and love smoked where you could see right you know that it was disappearing it didn't just linger and and I land, I think that's a lot of that that it was talking about and I think they even brought up about you know it didn't leave the film The odor the smokeless okay Ashley good good good memories of everything it was in there all right you had a chance to take the product home hmm what is it to a net what is the biggest benefit that you see of the of the cigarette after smoking it for a couple weeks what is the one thing that you can sit back and say this is to me key in this product, okay, I would say because of the lower tar and nicotine you can feel it because you don't cough is much we mean by the okay with smoking and you know it bring on site has problems or whatever you know I don't think you can talk as much so you notice that after the two weeks of smoking it yes ok when will you notice it, I guess a couple of days after okay you know there was a difference did you make a complete switch to this product during the test or did you dabble with your usual brand a little bit tell me about how you use it, no it was it was basically a complete switch don't get me wrong maybe in that week maybe I have a pack okay of regular okay but now it was basically a complete Suite okay so you made a complete switching you noticed in a couple days that you do you weren't coughing as much as what you thought okay you've been back to your usual brand for how long now since last Thursday last Thursday how do you, but your usual brand after going back to that now, the same as you did before the sign is that did before but if I had it to do it where they kept on asking you know about like what would you buy what would you buy right, okay I think when it came down to it I would buy the new cigarette but probably had by half and half okay half and half way half we have, the only thing I'll K the only thing I have against cigarette is it is an adjustment to smoke them what is the biggest adjustment in your mind well at first when you start lighting you're like you know really or not yeah harder to lie I think that's a big thing but then like I say the more you smoke them the more you do it just out to it and then, if you're outside whether it could be a faulty cigarette or not sometimes it would go out just real soon okay this long without end I really felt like it was the wind okay, then let me see okay harder to light didn't last as long as some of the cigarettes a big fault with it like I think your base bad like if they're on the telephone to smoke okay and if you're talking or something or you know you have company and you wait when you start with that cigarette it's like you have to keep on smoking it but if you have a pause in between then it's like you're having to do that, that purple over again to get it going again to get it going again how big of a problem is that for you, I mean obviously you're fighting it's aggravating what was it still aggravating at the end of the second week to do that, well I think that's where I had come to know that once you lift those up you need to go ahead and finish them and not have the passes okay okay as stupid as that sounds no that we've heard that before that's good I appreciate you sharing that,what did you really like about the product during the two weeks talked about your some of your dislikes what is it that you liked the taste is not bad at all okay not bad at all and I'll be truthful I did enjoy smoking them inside the house you so you cuz I but you smoke in the porch but with these we did smoke me inside okay when you say we you're sharing them I shared some with my husband I think it's like a pack and a half okay and so no I still took, some of those outside you know on the porch to but then if I was inside and doing something one cigarette I didn't stop go outside with those are let him up inside how do you feel about that I enjoyed that part you know really even order in the house so and I honestly felt like it was course don't get me wrong I know that that short of time you couldn't tell but I really did not, feel like it was leaving any film or anything because I'm certain you've been in smokers houses especially if we're to I'm smoking you can tell on the wind has the glasses you know and I honestly did not feel it was leaving any of that family okay so you like that aspect, obviously other than the people who live in the house with you your husband and your two children the over the couple week period of Time how many people do you think you talk to about the cigarette you know first of all how many do you talk to and then I'm going to ask a follow-up question which is how many people did you let try it first of all how many people do you think now because of a net know something about this cigarette, I'd say 15 15 people okay what did you tell them about well they were amazed okay you know we're talking well course you know some of them noticed that it wasn't you know burning down and sort of looked at you funny okay and so anyway you know talking about you know that it was like an experimental thing test stages what did you tell them, well I think the biggest thing that they were amazed as there wasn't burning down you know so we went through this deal about you know just Heats of tobacco it doesn't burn it you know it was supposed to be lower in tar and nicotine it's not supposed to leave them you know there's no ashes no you know went through the whole bit because you know like I say they were amazed right amazing in a good way or skeptical, half and half half in here how does it I'm curious how does it feel to be it sounds like you had to explain the cigarette you were kind of the center of attention well it's like they're going you know it can't be a cigarette if it's not going to burn down okay and what would you tell them to that just talking about it doesn't burn the tobacco you just hate it okay yeah that that's why it took longer to light it to get it you know that the little, tip on the end you know was what was keeping it going in okay yeah okay so about 15 people than you talk to about it the most of that occur in the first couple days there was that spread over the two weeks that you sort of spray it over the two-week spread over the two weeks and the general reaction of course people are amazed by it would you say the general reaction or the feedback that you received was it neutral - positive both okay you know someone was really, graced with it and of course send this smoked you know tried it okay then some that didn't smoke course it's like everything else will you don't really know what's in it okay you okay so they expressed some skepticism over how it was made or we're getting a house how we don't know if it's better for you are not it how would you answer that question well I'll tell him I said well that's true I'm taking their word for it okay, you know but but really and truly I felt better you felt better uh-huh did you tell anybody that yes what was their reaction to that, well steal the same some of the ones that Skeptics I think well I always be Skeptics and the ones that was amazed you know I think would have liked to have had some to try for themselves to see I guess that's a good way for okay what about other smokers how many different people that smoke did you let try the product, oh gosh I forgot hanging it was to take the car home thanks I'm just gonna do this I want you to meet a net and that Janice okay we're going to get out of here in time so I don't want either one of you to worry about that yet put your purse down and make yourself comfortable here for about a half hour okay, and that's had the benefit here of already talking to me for about 15 minutes so I'm going to I'm going to pick on you and then we're going to come back to in remind me if I forget to the reaction of other smokers to the product but before we do that Janice quickly tell us a little bit about yourself married single do you live with a smoker do you have kids in the house okay I married my husband smokes we smoked the same brand of cigarettes you smoke Winston in the Box okay 24 year old daughter, lives with us but she doesn't even matter because right so she has like a it's not an apartment but it's a room bigger than this so we don't smoke in her room okay are anywhere around her she doesn't smoke and I have a married daughter and she doesn't smoke okay she doesn't they don't live with you no okay and her husband doesn't smoke, believes in an apartment close to me but she smokes okay no I think that's good I just wanted to get a flavor for who you lived with did they smoke pot smokers D and this is a question for both of you do you enjoy smoking, nod your head yes you enjoy smoking you feel guilty about smoking or do you just you get okay so you see you enjoy it but you feel guilty right do you wish that you could quit yes you do you do you want do you want to quit, I'd like to do you like to to certain yeah to certain extent I enjoy it but I also realize I probably be healthier not smoking I think that see it okay okay, I was talking to a letter earlier about you've been participating in some research for a few weeks now in this is the end of the research and it's time for us to ask some questions again in side your head and get at how you feel about the experience the first part of the experience I wanted to talk about Janice was you came here a few weeks ago for a demonstration of the product do you remember that yes okay we remember specifically about the demonstration what three weeks later you were you were here for an hour tell me about what you saw, well one of the things that impressed me a lot was watching the film watching the film and seeing that the smoke disappears is like steam uh-huh I was really impressed with low tar and nicotine okay what kind of how low was the turn nicotine do you remember I'm trying to think now it's alright I know it's hard to do I think well I think you could smoke like 30 of those cigarettes 21, Winston and I think it was like nineteen percent turn nicotine That was supposed to 80 something okay how are you remembering a little bit of a chart you remember what the numbers are now I thought it was 88% water 12% okay glace renting something on the new one and I'm probably run okay I don't know maybe you're both the right I'll tell you before you leave here though who's right and who's wrong okay so you remember that in the end, and the video tape and I remember, trying to get the cigarette lid that was in the in the group in the group okay and what happened well it's just hard to get lit in the course I was really excited when I found out we were going to get to take some home okay real excited about that what was your first reaction to the product which was it what you expected, I didn't really know what to expect but it was it was good I meant for a long time one of the girls in the group in commented that about a month ago she started smoking real light cigarettes and that it took her about a month to to get to that point where she you know felt comfortable with the new cigarettes just cut out a lot of them and so, I wasn't disappointed when I found that they were not quite as strong as mine because I sort of expected that okay and I thought well you know I'll get used to it okay that's something I'll just get used to just like that I had to learn to be nailed okay okay take me two years to learn about the old guy would all right what do you consider you after having been with the product for a little bit, of time what do you consider to be the one key benefit of a few well I felt my when I would smoke those sort of set of time about 8:00 at night when I sat down to watch TV or something like that and I would just smoke those cigarettes and then smoke maybe one Winston before I went to bed but I noticed that didn't hurt in the year what do you mean by that, don't know I smoked a lot at night when I'm watching TV just and because I have a lot of nervous energy and that's reason I'm afraid that I wouldn't be successful quitting smoking I don't think I have any trouble going through the pain of it but it's just the what I do with myself for 30 years mmm so, when I smoke so much at night and noticed that my chest will hurt a little bit right in here and those did okay those didn't cause me to they were real hard too, draw for me okay that was that was sort of hard and, so, as a result I didn't smoke as much because, and so that benefit I didn't smoke as many of my Winston's as I did when I didn't have the new cigarettes because, I wouldn't allow myself to smoke the Winston's so I sort of you know time to myself why don't you allow yourself to smoke them because I wanted to just just smoke those cigarettes just exclusively like for a couple hours not not trade back and forth and because if I did, at first when I first got the cigarettes when I would try to trade back and forth I found that I wouldn't smoke those okay and so as a result I didn't didn't really know how how they just you know maybe go half a day or something without smoking those and I just keep on smoking my Winston and my daughters were so impressed with cigarettes and they wanted me to smoke those why because they want me to quit real bad they want my husband myself to quit real bad they were, about us they hate the second-hand smoke we know we can't smoke around them how did they feel about the cigarette oh they didn't mind it at all I we went to we have an

fzgv0183,"sit down, okay here's where we're at is what we're doing my name is Keith and I'm going to be your discussion leader tonight by way of background I have an independent opinion research company and I'm based out of Washington DC and what we're doing is conducting a study that's part of a much larger study where we're doing a number, a of these kind of discussion groups and it's about people's reaction to the way media treats corporations and we're going to focus very very narrowly tonight on one specific example of that it's it's one article in a newspaper magazine and you'll see the top there's as businessweek free questionnaire it's an art article that you're going to be reading a we're going to be talking about it's about one company it'll become it's pretty clear in the questionnaire which company is about, and it's that's it's basically just it's just a research project what we're going to do when it comes time to talk I'll call and some people with generally it's a chance just to have a free-flowing discussion there's no right answer is no wrong answer the only thing I probably will ask you is just to go one at a time and the reason that is is because we're we make a recording of This which helps me write a report for my clients and one at a time helps get it on the tape so if you'll start by filling out these questionnaires I'd, she ate it and at the very top on the right hand thing there's a right hand side there's an ID code you can put the number that's on your on your little name tent there up top that would help me a lot, and there's also questions on the back so don't forget to fill out the back as well all right number two, put three slots but we only have 10 people so one numbers fishing I'll be right back going to get a cup of coffee,jobs are also, you figured out it's okay to get up and get absolutely no problem,okay well a couple your finishing off by filling out the backside there one of the one of the major companies are asking about it here is Philip Morris we're going to focus a lot on that company tonight what what are your basic because you've come into this room what our basic opinions of them any words or phrases used to describe a large diverse diverse, connecting with tobacco, what else, - I just hope the move to the side or something how many people saw this movie The Insider, correct describe what was it, based on a 20 - 40 bucks Philip Morris but as far as I know it's somebody else, just about a interview that was quashed on 60 Minutes, what's going on Mike Wallace is in the movie portrayed by Christopher Plummer and just gave it just has a very negative image of the tobacco industry, a man who worked at that he could work with them but sort of is going to be kept secret, it's running be sold by suggest you do have two hot girls and I know that their product line most of it I use besides your cigarettes so I think for people come because all the product line is operated company's products which ones how many foods, I don't put I don't know, top of which evening persons of Philip Morris is a company old company blue-chip steady growth well-diversified Lena, it's sort of a negative impact on me, how do you know a bunch of other corporations that were right at their companies like AOL General Electric Walt Disney Texaco how do you how do you think of Philip Morris against those kind of companies or comparison to those kind of companies, about the same or different go go ahead down, all right well I would say for the most part that full of more probably has this negative image because of all of the controversy with the smoking whereas most of the other companies many of them of course are very Diversified but most people just recognize them you know when they're freaks ban you and for the most part, I would think that they have a positive image field in terms of contributing something positive for you look I mean I'm sure Fillmore's like you to write up this way I'm sure they do a lot of charitable things I'm sure they do like community service you know as mentioned here 30 with their employees which were like you said it's old or plugs old company and good stock whatever you know if I go to sleep, Lion King or go to Disney World I get really excited about Disney but there was a whole report came out of book the maps that something about Disney that was quashed when their theme park their new theme park opened up with the animals ever get what's called animals were dying before hand you know Texaco at this whole discrimination suit against them not creating a African-Americans fairly you know I don't know if I would necessarily not fill up my car with Texaco but, you know your you watch these things and tobacco especially as you know has a negative mindset but you know I might boycotting ABC or ESPN because of the things that Disney does know but there's certain things that always company have and I look out for them I see what's in the paper and I'm aware of some of them talk about two different versions of Philip Morris the rest is from the welder they own craft food so there they do, the first and foremost the tobacco company and that was like their engine and the Kraft Foods part of his doing real good but their stock is done broke poorly recently because of the lawsuit, but I'm free anti-smoking so you know wouldn't, I'm not sure what they're getting at in the way the economy is the company's earnings are incredible a lot of these so people will sacrifice that well I'm a Believer and smoking but the earnings were unbelievable and so then the the lawsuits come and the biggest thing was the blatant lying in front of Congress we didn't know that nicotine was harmful and that's kind of, go ahead like I think your favorite change your name to Graham Foods their stock would be 100% harder today their dividend has eight percent which is high and I think the stock would be one of the best docs on the market and as a result of bad this city through papers and articles and Newsweek or whatever everybody who's the owner of this talk and some people rely on them for their livelihood has suffered the negative part of Omar's I agree with these cigarette proton blast, but the positive part of the 99% of your other company which is also a very profitable is not realized by mostly public there's a kind of a stark choice in the back number for about people who are top corporate Executives of Philip Morris very Stark choice and what they're asking you to do is choose one that they're seeing their like senior Executives any other company got a legitimate job to do or there are moral because, they sell a product that harms that users would which side did you all come down to how many how many took the first one gentleman job will go with the last one there more might take that, whether it's just I mean like you said pack is bad but they're going to promote it because it's getting in my head is getting them some money there's just negative and positive with anything and I think anybody I think Miller because many people have tobacco industry and they don't do it to the alcohol people they'll go after many many other companies, these Pages tobacco companies versus Choice whether he wants to be killed by performing these products or not well it's Fabio killing logic, health insurance companies in America are redevelop billion dollars into cigarette companies a few years ago so like anything else in a capitalist Society mutated to go with the bed you are good things that Philip Morris manufacturers also all right is Phillip Morris changing I mean not obvious there's a lot going on in the legal world and public opinion and politics around, and the products it goes cigarettes at Philip Morris makes are they changing at all or not, as a company trying to change your image apparently yeah because they're trying to acquire all the kids that are 18 like they like to drink in like they Park them at their under 21 now it's like we can't get them was you show idea if people come here which is which doesn't really know how much are they doing that I know personally I work on a college campus and the number of young people smoking now compared to 45 years ago as a lot, big companies are tiny little little stores they don't care they're going to feel like I could bring more money into them they're going to cry that's losing profit for that felt it only makes me think they're changing yeah I think the whole tobacco industry is kind of change the way they operate in Pastor has a lot of secret documents and, Court proceedings in the lawsuit Center think on Earth some of the unethical practices tobacco industry not just Philip Morris but the other major tobacco companies like Reynolds and, I think they think as any industry or any person does as you as you as you live and grow and learn from your mistakes I think it's very important to them to have I think it's important to any company to have a good image Public Image so are they doing to improve their I think so they're in a couple industries that are controversial like they own Miller and there's a lot of times with drinking and some tobacco lines of Marlborough and, there's a lot of problems with, that so there is some controversial Industries and, overall they have a really good job of marketing the products you know keeping ourselves down, their marketing actually offends me though because I as an ex-smoker it's very good morning is extremely well targeted marketing if you look at the way they're going after the 18 to 22 year old market and it offends me because as an expo I know, well what it can do to your body and I'm just afraid that it's so good as this gentleman mentioned that is increasing smoking is increasing yeah because you know what there's smoke in here because they can get the gear all the the jackets in the t-shirts and the luggage so you smoke more just to get the stuff off twice as fast yeah that's what they're doing that's what the cuts by their War aim towards the kids because it's, the new smoking go Outdoors giving bring moves away and anybody else what else besides making it ugly too there are some signs do you think that they've got wallet some of the promotional period oh I think there has definitely been, n/a overall decrease in the amount of advertising I remember and I don't know where the camel is the Philip Morris cigarette or not but it was a lot of controversy over the the camel young people getting you know using that and your promotions but I think that overall the whole smoking controversy and with young people I think they smoke the question peer pressure when I used to smoke I Smith be cool with it was the, in thing to do not because of any ads or I just think it's a peer thing that sometimes we tend to put the responsibility for something that perhaps parents should be you know dealing with with your children when the the public none of my children ever took up to have to look and even though I used to smoke I think it's just a gum, the type of social issue that people need to deal with within their own groups as opposed to blaming the corporation for the speaker person right there I think it's a backlash what's a backless I think I think there's more young people smoking because it's so because of the pressure not to Smith from The Establishment to do something so it's a rebellion through its at the more the, how much more I mean you brought drive down and pull boards and you see all this non-smoking spot that wasn't there five years ago which more young people smoking I'm just going from what I say, I work address on pan, I just see a lot more young people spoke very few years ago does anyone know if that's true that there are any status I haven't read anything I don't know my impression was it was leveling it's leveled off though we're down slightly but I don't know maybe maybe those schools it is up okay well one of the things we're going to do tonight is quite a bit of homework so I hope you brought your homework shoes with you first thing we're going to do I'm going to pass out this article I told you we were going to look at look at this article, I want you to pass it out but just put it in front of you don't open it up yet I want you to look at the cover look at the cover and then after you take those take take one of these and pass it along to if we end up short down at the end up and basically on the gray sheet on the gray sheet everything on the gray sheet or some questions about the cover I'd like you to take your pencil answer those three questions that are there, the three questions say what's the main point that's being communicated by discover what do you think the main focus of this article is going to be and what impact does the cover have on your own perceptions of Philip Morris if any, okay three questions just write a short answer to each, a couple words or sentence just based on the cover,once you finish writing the answer to this then I like you to spend the time to read through the article, and now I will say this again but I realize it's going to take awhile when I read it at my usual fifth grade Pace it took me about 25 minutes so maybe maybe about 20 minutes to Pace yourselves 15-20 minutes to go through it and read it for me then we're going to talk about it after you read,I'm back, sorry,finish I got two more sheets for you to fill out, the end of a writing session from then,yeah put your number on the yellow sheet all the shoes,you can smoke there, she's a she's like a militant Pro Smoker she loves boats letter to the owner of the house members are similar but he lived Hugh's dish lives in Cincinnati correct I know I didn't do that to a friend of mine, the children he fathered they didn't mention and little fairy have the think they're animals the some kind of all kind of stuff I read so the movie as crazy as it seems that happened didn't it didn't scratch the surface areas for agencies, we'll just have a little discussion just,okay we can start talking here about Rusty I haven't finished up your Yellow Pages of paper we go ahead and just finish up we'll talk amongst the rest of us what tell me some of your major impressions of what you read some of the top impressions, I was disappointed to see that they really have no intention of getting out of tobacco if anything your whole problem is to explain the World Market to maintain that ten billion dollars a year in Revenue to get each year 66 percent of the company's net income I was hoping to see that they were trying to shrink tobacco market and get into other areas but, seem to not be the case, Karen how much you I don't smoke either but I just I didn't see why they should get out of the backyard like it's not like I don't I agree with them like I didn't see them at fault for what people choose to do I mean they're just making it that they don't go with another company is going to do it or another, I was thinking the other day I decided to be a great stock price I really feel like anything else this is a real bad boy today tomorrow someone else it'll be a bad boy never forget about Philip Morris for a while and it's talk is so undervalued it's mind boggling my opinion, they want to share that opinion this would be a good stock to buy now after with did you have that opinion could be created by this article yes this is the names there I know it's Tom and also come you can just leave them at that's right that's just saw something on TV about 12 more singles on CNBC when I know, Philip Morris and everything the time it was probably goodbye there was one interesting thing that I said I can worst case scenario they completely lost all the lawsuits there really for problem rs.100 a case all I have to do is raise the price of a pack of cigarettes 7 class sensitive breaking I thought that was pretty cool the people that smoke was still there, for $20 a share and making trillions so it's a most strange why, John what kind of Impressions did you have out of this article I researched many because I only before this article I own a stock I followed I believe that undervalued but I'll also with him lost half the half of their market value and that we think it's you know rebound quickly regardless there's other stocks out there right now that you can buy off you want to make a profit much quicker profit on, long term with your good stuff too hello other takeaways from the article over the stock side what how do you think they come across I was how does the company come across this particle, companies trying to Rebound with the public as far as for opinion or the opinion trying to fight too bad public opinion with their own quick public in their charity work in their contributions are far better than most other companies, I was kind of surprised that God wants us there or not but if they're going to try to paint a pretty picture of themselves there wasn't anything in the article about what it's like working for the company for Joe everyday employee it was all about the big guy there was no motion all the operating operating in I thought I caught were starting your autopilot for the figured it's going to be not the person that works here the regular guy says it's a great place to work well I guess it, outside of the smoke you know I think you're right now spending more that too but the one thing it does touch on that I think is a key to some degree of the article is what the employees told the company is that weird Bounty image and we won't change and based on that they started all these things you know to change the image it's kind of like you know what we'll use to pull doublethink in 1984 you know it's bad when you have free choice in it which is an argument I have or and I don't think is responsible, you know they do these things with the youth you know to prevent smoking but on the other hand you know they go into college campuses where kids are so anxious young people want kids to get a job you know and you start 40,000 and I'm going into the third world where there's not as much militancy against smoking and was more accepted I'm not a big fan of the Palestinians like one found that it was a defensive what we're doing with them and mention and the other thing I got the impression is you know they're really dealing with the best in the, brightest the lawyer they mentioned there you know work I think the County Administration it said or whatever you're not dealing with you know you know fly-by-night lawyers either armed to the teeth with with really good people who know what to do and I think you know the people can they control themselves a little bit they do do wonderful things they did get an ordinance from the city of New York to be able to have some smoking facilities within the confines, but you know in some of the executives you know hold a cigarette you know in the picture every year and all that but I still think it is something that has proved detrimental and I've seen them I've seen him on television shows where they've been very calm and nicely dressed and say this is your choice and this is what you do I saw one show when Mario but used to be in Philadelphia if you remember back then before he is Chun and what national they had, somebody on from I think Philip Morris or Tobacco Company talked about all the M sport all of this evidence about smoking and how can it harm you and eat denied it and he said it's not really proven and I'm not saying I believed him but he had so many good things to say was so powerful in this presentation you want to Blink these are and that's the one leaky Impressions I had that they're changing their strategies to accommodate and that there are really are, also very bright people other stuff that they're changing their strategy someone else are they probably just changing strategy they actually changing their company changing the way they behave in the way they think I think there are group of this gentleman completely that he spent a hundred million dollars out of ten billion dollar profit annually in a PR effort I think they're very very bright people very Insidious people in there, on to be very successful people, Diana what kind of impression did you have this article well, number one the executive View, their job I mean their responsibilities to the organization the same way that other Executives get their responsibilities to be a particular organizations so they realize that the social issues are they are but on the other hand need you would as a necessary evil and I think somewhere in the article they, talk about their market share here in the United States and worldwide, and it's almost this underlying tone of, so far the United States has been the Forerunner in the and he's smoking but when you go around the world there's an anti-smoking movement doesn't exist or it's very going to school to be so therefore, they approach seems to be that people want to smoke and we're going to maintain and find ways in is less offensive the as possible to maintain or increase our market share we will try in the process to repair our image but there is a market for our products and we're going to go after completing our survey we tell the public about your research departments that are trying to draw, rough on nicotine cigarettes or e-cigarettes won't harm you if it's possible and if they are doing that kind of research but I don't think the public is aware that they don't educate the public that the great that they are trying to improve their danger to smoking you don't hear about a half that stuff the way you used to go low tar and Littlestown let's go on just as long as you don't they know it's crap and the public doesn't buy it I don't know if Linda what kind of what kind of reactions, image of the coming out but I think they should stop trying to convince everyone but they're not teenagers because I think statistics show that most people even some of the executives started smoking when they were teenagers so my perspective is they should just try to get out of it back not get out of it but try to get into other things and I don't see there they're making you think, they're going to change their strategy but I haven't really seen from this article how they doing there was a question I think it's the second one on the pink sheets that this article is this article positive neutral or negative towards Philip Morris how many people said this article is negative towards Fillmore's got ones that was negative towards but more somebody said it was neutral towards Fillmore's 12 and how many said it was positive towards Baltimore has one two three four, 456 can you look at Jim's and see what he said, neutral okay six positive three neutral one - someone who said positive tell me tell me why positive were you Jimmy Neutron father, give me positive Tom O'Connell sort of neutral tell me Peggy what stopping the advertising doing away with the Billboards and stop aiming toward kids you don't hear about them for a while you got to buy the cigarettes if you want to buy the cigarettes but they're not advertising like, which is good for me good yes I agree I think they understand that a lot of the criticism is coming from those people who feel that they are going for the younger people under age 21 so just like the liquor industry where there are you here in the commercials a little Adam one should be, what do you want to drink you know I think they're trying to move in that direction similar to the alcohol commercials that sometimes I hear them where they emphasize is okay to drink but you should be responsible for and bottom of the page is something about being 21 so I think that if they could they'd probably leave if they could overcome the public image of marketing to teenagers, they you know they want a large part of the battle and that this is an adult thing and adults make decisions to either smoke or not smoke and then you should wait until you're an adult to pursue that habits really come across this article is really trying to not want to Market to teenagers when they were interested train three thousand retailers to go recognized full site he's at because of positive Sean, it was written by somebody who's very aware of how to suddenly make it positive with outstanding defensive is very they made him seem like they made they made these five people to talk about very human you know we're not want out of monsters who you know he didn't the people again why neutral wonderful topic that's initial it's the Oracle toward Philip Morris the article is basically a series of, is with the top Executives from Philip Morris I don't think it was an article, that was saying Philip Morris is great or Felton Norris it's horrible it was just here's what it's like to work at for Philip Morris and then whoever wrote the article is very neutral like they filled in some facts and put some data in there and but they really didn't say anything like well Philip Morris's going in a good direction of moment that direction so they said what direction Philip Morris has gone into it it really talk about like the ethical Parts too much these kind of, of State some facts and here's how the top Executives feel about working for those companies, well you're out of the room did we ask how people voted on the second question pot was the article positive negative neutral We snuck a peek at your paper yeah usually sort of decision for what you want to explain why you gave a neutral thought it was either positive or neutral and and I went with neutral because it didn't come right out and say that, you know it's okay to do this you know what but the fact that it wasn't - that it is neutral makes it positive because it's a negative going here you know so it's even put neutral it's kind of like positively thank you know what I mean I mean you're going in the way the whole article is set up its the cover is the most you know viable reviled company almost no of front it's going to be there weren't conic of the other way but what about the cover what kind of impression is this picture on the, uh cover create where you can also flip back to it and look at it what kind of Impressions does that cover create only the come on tardy want to show you what we're all about it says come and says come inside for sure what we're all about we be filled more saying that we want to show what y'all up, and it Norman Rockwell's our CEO Norman Rockwell confused and missing red in the bottom it's like that had something to do with lines word, he looks confused he looks like yeah but I wanted to kind of what kind of images do you get from from the company where this man by looking at this picture, ladies ladies in the Bible Belt sort of God his name is like yeah it looks to me like he like a country preacher like they like the weathered face I mean he looks like a guy running for president, this kind of signifies the old Blue Chip company and they're backward a lot of times the way, they view how the world is today and this is the way we've been doing business interests commercials on TV this is the way we've been doing it doesn't for 80 years and that's what people are going to get and there's these new companies are coming in are like on a Cutting Edge it can either either it's like you represent is the old school and they're powerful and do whatever it wants to do great what kind of images conjures up when you see this coming, Bible is interesting and is mentioned I think someone closeness before I was hoping to get a little bit more perspective of the daily life there the average worker once we are able and I think you really get that and the more reason I chose - not anyone has made but I want to mention all the changes that everyone talked about many things are so positive I think you have to remember those aren't changes because they want to do they're trying to stabilize the bleeding they're paying out billions of dollars and was already renegotiated for more money, so these are not changes they're doing because they're just you know seen the light they're having these changes including a good at making changes because they have to I think you're Miss I think people respectfully I like the changes but I think it's wrong to think that doing them because of this you know their Judgement Day or the stuff that's in you think they'll go back to the old way after they get all the racket I think, but I think there's a lot of differences between companies and I think a lot of things they do or horrible there's something to be said credit go ahead go ahead and lie what you're saying I don't see, what they're doing in order to Stave off the criticism that anything different than what a lot of companies do whatever he could win it, I know I wouldn't be because I didn't think that when the heat is on people respond and if you never called the task and you just go back your business and do whatever and this has been there the culture and many Industries if it wasn't for federal regulations or unions or whatever this run roughshod over the people and learning why nobody is doing anything about it I think you're doing what any CEO of a company with your appointment and keeping in mind that, these people do not own the company company is owned by the public and they're fighting their best to protect the image in the in the profitability of the company for the public who owns 80% of the company, and check it is some of these talk orders a day on to be shocked it they really don't want as much stock as you think they did when it companies to get large salaries but each one of these CEOs I'm sure can go to any other company in the country and get to Maine the same kind of money because they're valuable people with brains, this guy who's the CEO Jeffrey Bible how does the article treat and how does the the reporter in this publication treat him how does he come across I guess is another way to say how does he come across, well I think very very well again I was neutral towards you article but I think you article you haven't realized it was written businessweek natural to my way positive slant to it absolutely yes a concern but I think the portrait of Bibles is very this positive as a cigarette the executive can get at I think it's all crap, there is a very successful strategy and it's probably a he's a good company to buy stock in, choose, Karen honey think he comes across town to Port right here I think it's a positive um they seems to like, he like, like he's stressed like he makes things better in only like anything they down on me up like he sounds like a like a guy that listens and then changes things and was a positive outlook on them, Tom how much you home so it's going to be a very powerful image the city stands there for the last cigarette like javelinas hand and nothing they went around they touched only if they try to create like The Human Side of them to I think I'm not sure if it was in there talk about the women's tennis there's no sponsorship deal with this plasticity got all chipped try to show a little bit of the other side, person to person, just with the first paragraph there that you know says you know, what did I do to make the world better that's what it's going to come down to, what do you think there is sort of this there's this one statement in the beginning about your measured by what you do on the arithmetic goes on and talks about you know what he's doing is ahead of a cigarette company what how is that how does that come across, how do you think this this reporter makes that sound how does that come across to you is he I think they tried to show some of the human qualities of me top management like how the one guy was, in a foreign country or can Aid relief for five years and fruit flies on the children's faces and they had done good things in their life and what they they had a sense of humanity it was just happens to be that they're working for a very successful company and an industry leader but they're working for a company in an industry that's in a very controversial, industry right now Jim well I mean I think they do a good job of make over all the teaser human guys who, I'm making a living and who are not actively trying to trying to destroy the world or try to try to hurt people so I mean cigarette smoking is a very popular everybody wants to which to burn and a culture where like stuff that's going on out there let's all get let's all gang up on cigarettes because you know it's proved he's sometimes the lesser of the year, I'm sort of being used by I was never I was never in the thick of cigarette smoker but so I don't have I don't have the passion for it they puny has but I really am like the whole how horrible it is and have people line up at you know to wave the flag at the the horrible devil of cigarette smoking when there's a lot worse those are out there was one of the questions they keep it keeps running, and through this the theme as they talked to the I guess the five corporate execs here is how do you answer the question right honey answer the big question how do you work for a company that kills people honey what's your feeling is you read through this article about that company gonna go ahead I'm not a psychologist here but they have rationalized it real well in their own mind really big time and and who am I to say that they don't believe what they're saying is true you know it's a real good at believing there's a lot of, there's a lot of people that rationalize things their own mind to what they believe it that was a big theme and at the say something before about you know there's some truth to say hey well what are we going to do not do it because the government says not to do it you believe in that philosophy of living here there's some truth to that statement and then I'd come back and say you have it in a we can't push it to the other extreme good character, just because there's pine it doesn't mean you have to go out and buy something the company should the state's I think it's coming more and it's probably more harmful because with that particular in stay educated enough to do it, it with the liquor they don't you don't see a start in the state store saying this may cause problems in your family well you know they've got every beer at service because you make was probably your family and every Soldier almost yeah well that's a very important factor they'll try to go ahead and Diane I think it also points out that the very clear contradiction because on the one hand the cigarettes a lawful in this country, and you have the you have the lobbyists that are holes of Congress and Senate I mean we're not about passing any laws here to ask you all the cigarettes so therefore these people who are involved with the cigarette business terrible awful business you know you can't you know it's almost like the government wants it both ways you know it's a lot of money tied up in it they're not trying to promote this fish, sure World prohibition which didn't work when they did with the alcohol back in the 20s but I think the government sends mixed messages I mean if you feel that strongly about it out Lord then the cigarettes are going to grab and you know that'll be another issue but they're not doing that they're just and I think these people realize that it's just you know they are the bad boys right now and I mean everybody knows the hadza to the dangers but the government is not going to go so, so far as to outgoing a problem and so since they're not going to do that it's a knew you would come is there anything that you read this article that you learned that you didn't know anybody here learn something new you did,or do you know all this that you lives in here, charitable contributions of charitable knowledge of a heart Craig anything in there you didn't know yeah actually smells asking the question about where cigarette smoking was at this point I think I mentioned it's going down a little bit and there are numbers of yeah and I wasn't anything in there you didn't know now I didn't have the particulars of the of the big guys at work for me, now there really wasn't that I thought the lawyer was the probably the strongest character in here he always had like a little work for these guys like an ACLU kind of mentality because everybody's down these guys are at work you know because because because it's the because what somebody was kind of saying hey they got a right they have they have legal rights and this guy I mean he had a quote in there that I thought was right about that you know it's legal, but I really now I caught when I saw the caller I kind of expected with pain from the decent picture of these people that that's what would happen showing anything you learned that you didn't know about these girls were all real skinny and tall are you they're doing it, this is what is inside there were pretty situation was good with their forty thousand dollars and if it's guaranteed any sizable multi-millionaire who could compare the things we did was a real familiar with the company like like the stuff is in here 8 out of 12 from the top executives are smokers and it wasn't that the number I didn't know I sort of need to know that but I guess you figured well it was there anything you remember that kind of stuck in your mind is gee I didn't know you're doing, that's kind of interesting that kind of reaction, I don't know if we're just checking rated Beer Company country never really focused on the fact that Philip Morris was the world leader in the tobacco industry and, you know I guess the Articles would imply that you know we're fighting this battle here but at the same time we're building new and great Frontiers in some of the developing countries that are you know long way we are with the social consciousness of the cigarettes and I think from that point of view if you look deeper into to it it's very - because, we always well frequently we here in the United States experimental people in developing countries with our pharmaceutical and now we're going to dump but we're going to go after those unsuspecting people with the tobacco market and these are people who didn't have the resources that we have such as the media the education government, but she's taken away some - okay Peggy how about you there anything in here you learn didn't receive the only exception in New York but they weren't I didn't know that okay and how about you okay let's talk about that what about the fact that they own crap Miller announced is that how does that reflect, act upon either them or on those other companies, there were they seemed like they were about 45 to do that before we came in here already but how does that reflect the fact that they could come out of this article is it more people would know the craft Miller are Catholic pope Morris because apart from Craft and Philip Morris and crafts and motor do a very good job of divorcing themselves exactly yeah you think after the - for craft to be carful Fillmore's valorous right, we think is that everything that I probably would help Philip Morris more than it would hurt crafter but agree with Linda yeah it's pretty important shall we, so they know there's always a parent company and crafts probably didn't have a whole lot to say about it maybe you need to see how the take those if you were if you were Philip Morris top management person would you have let the businessweek reporter have the access that he had to write this article yeah sure would you try to stop it try not to let it happen in here they used to not give interviews, and I said this was one would they let him have it so was it a mistake or the right thing to do right, you think this is the kind of thing more company should allow happen, let a reporter come in and watch what you do for a living ask you tough questions should be a nice Excellence now I don't I don't think you should do it if your backs against the wall like full of morons I think you should do it period to you if you're an open Honest Company it's very outside you couldn't buy this kind of an advertisement it makes you more of an open and honest company yeah I don't think most companies are afraid of, let me ask you this if if a you know one of these one of these top management guys was in the mood for advice what kind would you give based on what you've read here today with anything that they that's in here that they should be emphasizing more or something that's not in here they should say, it struck me about the last closing paragraph from they were saying yeah but you know how come it when you stood in front of Congress and said that you weren't addicted how do you how do you get by that all well we were we weren't like sure of the definition I'm like thinking of who saying well it depends what your definition of is is like who said that you know we're saying teaching clearing well you know what was your definition of is it addictive so I think they a lot of people pretty sad I think people are not as dumb as, I think they think the world could have been done by saying it's addictive but we're selling a legal addictive product as opposed to complete we don't think it's a big deal at all come on you seriously and then saying jumping on well we didn't know the definition which reminds you clean Baba saying it as what is is, serial sex okay anybody else has any advice you give these guys go ahead no I didn't get the whole way through the article but I would just say maybe provide the public with more of your strategies on what new business opportunities you plan to get into my I didn't really see that I kept feeling that's what they wanted but we talked about that earlier I got the sense that they weren't looking at all to get into new businesses the, only business they wanted was to expand their world market share but you think it'd be cause of divorce them Erica I'm getting this in several you think would be positive for them to diversify if they diversify if they moved into some other me two product lines, is that true, I don't think it is 66 percent of their profits from from tobacco why would they want to change that think they're already reversible, any other advice, let me let me just lastly go go quickly through a couple of quotes that were in here is your reaction to his highlighted for you the head guy Jeffrey Bible talked about how he changed his mind at one point recently with the last couple of years you're so when he was negotiating they decided to sit down with the critics and agree to that big national settlement to pay a hundred seventy five billion dollars they also agreed at that time to do things like actually absolutely give up the Marlboro Man as one of their own, their marketing tools how did that come about how does that come across, Craig you want to leave with that how does that come across to me I mean I respect it and I think it's better than before but I think it was there stating off the bleeding of what could have been much more disastrous than what they're facing Jim how about you yeah I stopped that was what I was almost ready have their backs against the wall in the wash another guy in there Szymanski I think his name is, he's the one who went told the story about the his house his wife The Reef but yeah the wreath was placed at his house and he said he when he's asked how does it feel to work the company work for I don't want to look I can't lose somebody else's life we can't remove risk from people's lives if they choose to do risky things that's their choice, he's right, does that come across as that, yeah I mean it's good Arc he also talked about how the company spending a hundred million dollars a year anti youth smoking campaign they don't do Billboards anymore and they train thirty thousand retailers to spot fake IDs they've got the basically making the point they're committed to trying to cut down on you smoking I don't buy that but yet we're still selling a billion a day right come on they've got the most Creative Marketing in the youth magazines and I want to read them, kids under the age of 21 or looking for advertising systems are smoking because their friends are saying they have nothing to do with the bill brought into our what they saw on the TV because there was a pretty bad in the book and most of them probably don't smoke the more specific you know for to divide is cheaper cigarettes yeah so it's called Moore's he's not selling as many cigarettes of children's I think people think children buying cheaper cigarettes it's a premium cigarettes very expensive today, py weird are back I think there's the head of the worldwide operations Who quote some of their statistics saying that they've got 83 in the 83 youth prevention programs going throughout the world in 55 countries he makes the quote we don't want kids to smoke because it exposes us to attack as an industry, how does that come across as he addressing the third world kind of issue is an international issue I think that's a very realistic statement if they come by the way again I think I said earlier to get the anti-smoking groups off of their backs of terms of I think the real issue is filled by the miners smoking, I think that you know is what helps to keep it alive so if you could somehow move the issue off of from that level then the link to it being an adult type of behavior I think you would see a lessening of the criticism right I guess finding is crap I think I like to see some statistics on what the programs are and how they're changing opinions there's a famous story of taking two seconds to tell you of a CEO from an HMO that died he woke up he wasn't he, so the Pearly Gates he said I can't believe I'm going to have any salsa same Peter and said I'm in heaven I can't believe it you know what I did is a CEO of an HMO I just threw people out of hospitals people who are sick and dying I said have covered wasn't enough I'm how can I be in heaven saying Peter Burton says it's okay you only have two days I really don't know anything wrong but Mars is still getting used to because I don't think that's their market like I said before so, Dollar Wise if you can't afford their product and they know it John posting us alone up its karma, they go after the kids because of the children more sacred but 12 gotta but it was fuel because they're trying to recoup medical costs because too many people are bleeding Medicaid dry because they're dying of cancer at 55 years old it's not about the 13 year old and the other and then they go for the emotional pitches that you know John he's 13 years old and he's gonna kill himself already but it was the only way that the attorneys in the class actions were able to do is to recoup costs for the state people bleeding the medic, paid Medicare system dry and those were mostly people over 40 but they use you're saying that use the kids as yeah he's dirty and health smoking he probably has like five bed Partners to die they will still work for me though what are they going to say these people are PR experts these people are all multi-billionaires I'm sure we'll find out about Jeffrey wigand or whatever his name was from The Insider I mean there's issues with that movie too but I guess the longer they want, the major questions I'm asking you here tonight one of the reasons why I'm here is because this article appearing in a business week does it does it change the way you think about the company from the way you came in at all raise your hand if your answer is yes how did it change you crib, good morning to meet interesting to see what they're going through and I'm interested to hear I don't have this perspective and I think a lot of its double-talk and I think a lot of its PR but a little facts like you mentioned about the exemption New York and where things are at I'm interested in their mindset you know and where they're at I don't believe everything I think what you touched on this is a very this is a test of a concern with this is not very important magazine is conservative and and there and there, strategy based on what the employees wanted as I said in the beginning the article is to accommodate and to deal with the media because they will be coming iconoclast and they were isolating themselves and they are pressed to the gills to do something and Pete and carefully and you can bet these guys met Ad nauseam before they grain of these interviews as to what to say and they all work with the same gobbly gook out of their mouth and I think ultimately it is your choice to smoke and I agree with you but we're not what Mike Mike about Mike, I thought my hope is that you don't sleep because you're tired is anybody in here smoker anybody married to a smoker Linda how did it change you I think just basically you like this company, these Executives a lot better after you read the article you just like them better, any particular reason well because they present that human aspect of their hands give to charitable organizations and they're good people and that type of thing they're really not the bad guys about how would you care how do they change my whole thing was I mean I don't smoke and I don't I don't like to be around people that smoke I think thanks but I would never turn a blame the company for it I got blamed you for being dollars nursing a sobering to hear me but I mean like I mean everything to blame the company for supplying cigarettes, well I as a business person that it's sold me on the company is this from that perspective it's a great article from Mars, Mike better to change you, well no worries you're really gonna change my opinion is the same thing you coming in okay maybe I missed your hand okay anybody else, anybody else want to make any comment we have a cigarette he won't let me keep the arm actually I think I needed for my next now you can keep my I don't know what you can keep it if you want I have enough one of the question what acid it was one guy in here the Miller CEO made a very strong statement but it's 17 and 20 year old Sons as I want them to smoke or drink what do you think about that when he says that, there's the guys ahead of of work yeah I think it was your choice my choice is my kids are good choices taking smoke guys a head of a beer company that's owned by cigarette company he's saying his kids just because he works there doesn't mean he's a drinker he was 21st, and foremost on the parent yeah that's a first, I wish I would like to know whether the kids smoke or drink well I think that the generation of the heaviest smokers which are the people now maybe qualities State class action suit two people have 50 over who came up in a culture with looking was quite acceptable when I first started smoking it was, acceptable thing to do with your hands and all your friends did it but my daughter is who, Ruffian generation we have a lot of Education about not smoking and I don't know of any of difference is look so I think in their case the education about the risk has paid off but in my case I've stopped smoking but I certainly was a generation where that's very early age of 13 or 14 it was the end thing to do in that whole idea of the, Bob wasn't out there yet but I really thought I really think it had a critical mass and I think that the 25 year olds and up don't smoke as much anymore but I think there's some 25 year olds or smoking more out in the family's done any studies on it I don't have any how many 25 year olds would admit it but I know what I see walk around okay and you're all lot more young people smoking than there were five years and they're under doing it in rebelling because they overdid the can smoke but it's substituting the cigarettes for, years ago when I was looking kind of stuff you know it's in I really I do not require one thing I would like to do is I'd like you to leave League watch the your paperwork in front of you just as it is and as you leave today sweet little ladies out front and they'll pay you for your time and pat yourself on the back because you were good you did your homework, and thank you very much thank you thank you and I'll pick everything up just leave it you can have the article you want sure,do you have kids, he stepped out for a second be right back, thanks",0.8045840066346158,0.5953552,0.9128387

both via the fcr and verbal coaching during field rides do you know what that means, the statement yes ma'am as a district manager Todd represents that he provided feedback to his Representatives, by way of the fcr or field coaching report and also verbal coaching as he rode along with the sales representatives okay so I think I understand so where it says manager completes prior to discussion that would be the district manager not the manager that's written on the top of the form on page 1, So reading the form in the way it was intended to be completed yes the manager would have completed cultural Hallmarks commentary prior to discussion in this instance this individual completed this part himself okay that clears that farm and thank you very much okay you can set that aside, I believe

the country is that correct, objection of the report included redemptions from across the country and across the country but also include redemptions from Tennessee yes okay thank you Mommy can set

gfhb0039,"how about yourself Gina mean if you did you get it did you talk to other smokers about the cigarette or not yes I did I get two packs away one to a police officer who sits in a closed car all day and she liked the idea that the car the cruiser was not full of smoke and I wish I had given a pact to my son Virginia because my granddaughter has asthma and he has to go outside and smoke and I I didn't do it I should, yes I was stingy kept most of them for myself what how do you I mean like I ask Rick if you had this a look personally what was what was most attractive to you what was the biggest benefit for you as you would explain someone else hey look you need to our try this thing and here's what it's about how do you what do you focus on when you talk about the health part of it very big and the idea that you know you're not burning something that's going inside you okay, other than the the health issue that was that we talked about is there are other issues that doesn't smell up the house okay talk to me for a second about that I mean did you is that something that you personally know yes I have a small small house in the living room small and when you come in from outside and smell cigarette I don't enjoy that I don't like enjoy smelling cigarette smoke after in the Attic Dan on spray the you do not have to do that the house stays free and, I was told I haven't had enough cigarettes to make that type of a test they say it will not yellow the walls, and won't yellow your windows and my other cigarettes do every time I wash it television screen it's yellow yellow and black from cigarette smoke and so I understand it will not do that and that's just I'd like to fight math either of y'all smoke in your car yes both okay have you ever noticed that film that gets in your car window and you smell talk to me for a second if you you know if you did notice, any difference with this cigarette it's not you know when go on to another subject but it either y'all notice anything I never really noticed as far as the windows or anything goes but I guess just common basis would think that water and glycerin versus tar and nicotine which is going to stick Like Glue and water I think the glue stick yeah yeah it's I think that's the other aspect like she said about you're not drawing in tobacco we're not blowing it out either you're not trying it in and I could be blowing it out it's going to keep things cleaner, as far as the smell and everything else goes okay Rick is a question for you yeah you're out you know let's say you're out talking to another smoker about this thing and they go wait a second I thought you said no you know 90% less secondhand smoke but I still see a lot of smoke coming out of your mouth so what's going on here well you take a drag off of your cigarette employee remove watch yours and you watch mine and let's see who stands around longer you don't see it going, they have their own second and I can guarantee their Kyle shut up because it's the truth how do you explain them and we go what does that work well from what I understand from the the course basically we went through is that by using a high-resolution filtered carbon tip and wrapping it in spun and woven glass you can actually heat it such as a barbecue where you actually cook, the tobacco thus instead of pulling the tar and nicotine by burning it you're actually pulling 85% water and glycerin and 15% card nicotine versus the 80% or better of tar and nicotine in a regular cigarette maybe 15 to 20 percent water and glycerin now water and glycerin is as far as people are concerned they think oh that's kind of good but what people don't know is when you heard about those millions of ingredients excetera you know what I mean it was the point that what people don't understand is you have to have water and glycerin in the cigarettes that, keep them fresh I work at a farm stores have been working there seven years I have cigarettes such as Pall Mall 100's that I wouldn't sell the people they sat in the store for over a year and when they saw I want to come on you've got them so I'll take him and I'll crunch the cigarettes form French the packet they can you hear this your cigarettes would dry brittle and just they're stale as can be if you want to buy them fine but I'm letting you know ahead of time now if you've got something that the water and glycerin dries up out of well then in that case I'm cigarettes, twice as bad because now all you're doing stuck in a tar and nicotine but something here you're never ever be sucking in straight to our next game because you're not burning it I mean for the if there's any my neat little bit of tobacco and then that you can gets charred to be a miracle actually and the nice part about the resolution tip is there's no Mass but the meantime it gives you a good six to seven minutes smoke such as a piece of charcoal we do it Cooks your meat for a while and it burns out and dies there's no mess you can lay it down you can you know you can fill your ashtray with them and you, don't have a magic pick them up the hill tonight that's right he's clean okay it's moisture and the stuff that dry tobacco like he said well they showed us with and that's why it doesn't scratch your throat because it's its moisture okay what what do you think the Public's reaction is going to be this let's say eclipse is now in the marketing genius mm what do you think I mean let's say there's a lot of eclipse we could be amazed because I was, it in what way when what are they what's our what's the world the smoke more what could it potentially happen let's say that everybody smoking it quits the only you know everyone ends up liking it and you know like Rick and although this would never happen What would the world be like if everyone were smoking too close I think would be great but I can't I can't predict that things are to stranger what about you Rick you have any feelings about that well I think very first thing is going to get Susan can skepticism right all throughout everybody's waiting, I want to know how I don't believe this is just too good to be true there's nothing bad about it but everything's good how can this be it's a cigarette but then if people did find out every people didn't try you're never going to get everyone because there's different people for different different cigarettes but the meantime you're gonna find out I think a lot of people would really try it simply because of the cigarette out there and because of what it does when you hear about something like that if you're going to spend the same amount as what you're going to spend for your pack of kools or Salem's or marbles why not spend $2, and see if you can help yourself if you can help yourself and help other people around you and eventually they look at it as the fact of you can actually smoke around people that normally don't smoke my sister she's got three boys and her husband has been dropped down to bring our smoking in a laundry room 4x4 he pays the house payments and I came down a recently for that but the point of it simply is because of the smoke in the boys and the attitude and the health factors but what of all the sudden he was blowing out water into the air, which humidifier does anyway things like that also maybe you might be able to come back in and smoke cigarette when he's watching his movie instead of well I guess I'll go outside real quick Miss for but seven minutes and smoke a cigarette so I feel better that's that's something if people could find that out and people start trying it you're gonna have a lot of people who don't know why this is this is going to be something that it will go over in it it will revolutionize smoking and maybe everybody would should pick up the cigarette and try it if they did well, kind of throw a couple of companies out of business but in the meantime to it would it would help people around for all benefits Health neighbors atmosphere there's just there is a lot of benefits there's a whole lot and it sounds kind of strange coming from so maybe a cigarette benefits there really is though I mean if it was just there's only one or two things out of it that would be one thing if you were still sucking down heavy tar and nicotine levels that would be one thing but you're not, it's completely different and yet it still tobacco and it is still a cigarette it just doesn't have all the things and added into it simply because it doesn't need to you're pulling the flavor out you're not smoking the tobacco and that in my book I think that's what's going to turn it over the more people do try it the more they'll tell others in the more they'll tell others in the more they'll tell others and eventually you're going down there a lot of people out there goes to hey I'm gonna spend my two bucks why not get the flavor and spend the same two bucks as I am right now and knock them, killing myself as I said earlier it's the point of 18 milligrams of tar 60 milligrams versus one means I can smoke 16-18 cigarettes this is what we get when I'm going to smoke in the next 20 minutes if I was to light up one of my marbles and yet I love my mom bro but that's pretty good benefit of you ask me I smoked a lot of cigarettes all right now this remember these videos will be watched by people and in rentals okay when they get back no look at this one what's going on out what people feel alright let's say there's someone back there it says well, there's no market for this cigarette I don't think we should even waste our time and money to Mark the cigarette what do you what do you say to them right I think a man needs to re-evaluate the cigarette industry because there are so many people out there now that smoke and there's so many people that are really getting a fold over what the government is doing to us and how they are taking away every right we've ever had that he would definitely need to have to sit back and think about this for a minute because unless it tasted totally horrible and nobody would want to pick, get up then there is a market there always will be a market for something that's going to be better be better for you and still is comfortable and taste good if it didn't taste good well then it wouldn't sell but maybe that man must be a nonsmoker that I gets a cigarette of the future it's and we need it now I think it's great, where else is there to go I mean this is amazing badges I want a smoke I don't want to quit - no because you know you had some topics you want to definitely talk about and since we only have two minutes left what let's go ahead and get those out oh the thing I'm very concerned about and I was wondering if they'd be like in the packaging if they could have another piece of, cardboard here to put your instead of them I'm afraid they'll be in the street and at that that yes that concerned me okay and I thought you know where you could just as you take them out you could put put them back in somehow yeah they're they're looking at a number of different things right and there will be good devices one thing is in there looking at is putting in the carton a real thin with their Corner Pocket ashtray it's just real thin and you can fill it up with those four five six of them and then dispose them when you get a chance another thing is the back, what you're talking about is like a honeycomb pack where you can just slide them right back in there something that you could just yeah somehow so you don't drop them on the street because even the regular cigarette that's what really concerns me about that matter any other topics oh sometimes I wish I had just maybe a spec more flavoring in there did you try to talk to me for a second if you did try both Styles yeah now just this is the only style that I've tried okay why can't I don't, like mental no I didn't try that good we ought to try those real quick let's go back and forth if there's one word if you could just use this as you know what one word describes a cigarette Rick won't you, exciting, oh definitely can you do it again and use it on Center if I had to pick one word to describe Eclipse it would be exciting but give me that sentence so we have a person oh it's uh thing yeah if I had one word to sum up the eclipse I would have to use the word exciting, it was not EG exciting and amazing I think it's an amazing thing I can't imagine, whose head this came from how did they invent this and I think it's wonderful okay where do you get on with it bring it on the market what should the government's position now the government has taken a position on smoking and it is no smoking in government buildings no Smokin in the military sector what's the what should the government's attitude be toward the cigarette Rick I think they should look at the benefits and see what it can do and instead of arguing and get the point about cigarettes which people are going to smoke anyway whether, they stand outside they store or across the street and then let's County Schools I go right near the superintendent's of vehicle across the street getting stand in the parking lot smoke cigarettes yeah it's going to help these people that are going to smoke anyway let's give them a little bit of leniency if all the sudden you're going to find them",0.8165173743333334,0.6939378,0.9128392
gfxh0257,"back on the record the time is 5:30 p.m., mr. Morelli you've got exhibit 20 in front of you and I will tell you for the record it's a portion just cut down on Forest loss of the entire presentation and I wanted to turn your attention to the back page, which is headed team membership and this is a list of people in, medical Affairs in the first row correct yes just hand it then says who does what on strategy and development team Excel go implementation team pain Sade implementation team and then generic products implementation team who it says, everyone in PPS is in on the generic products implementation team is that a rims team or what what's being implemented yeah there were certain there were certain generic products that had certain FDA requirements for certain things that we had to do and that's that's what that was and then PV what part of medical Affairs was that, I've forgotten if we call pharmacovigilance and that was Danielle Eddie and Danielle said he's a physician Danielle is a pharmacist but for specifically for generics implementation oh Danielle yeah okay and that's again just to do with the rims that was all that you guys had to do with any generic that, required rims from the FDA, so yes there are elements of safe use put it that way because this is so far back some of these it was before Rems ekron a lot Lorenz rims came in and 2007 so it was pre rims but it was still certain safe to use telephones that we had to do okay but I mean 2007 you hadn't even arrived eval right run but so that's when the legislation came in okay all right, and now let me, we done with this one yeah okay, I've got it, sorry, 21, okay,are you have you read it mr. where I am okay this is an email string between yourself and Rod Hughes with some other Cece's on it yes and the subject line from mr. Hughes is prescription painkillers: company's attempt abuse proof OB voice opioids hey, see news correct correct and then mr. Hughes rights to Joanna schooler was she in medical Affairs know she's Communications person Joanna I'm sure you have this but I wanted to highlight this just in case it is remarkable how Purdue has positioned their product as abuse proof they did this by, by showing no data the exact algo abuse deterrent features are just as good if not better than oxycontin's in fact that tablet also uses poly Ox as the excipient and I read that correctly you didn't was there poly Ox in Excel go, I don't recall but I believe there was okay and what is you recall was the function of poly ox, it was an excipient, which means to it was a non active ingredient but part of the formulation and what, what did Polly Ox had to the drug I mean did it read more bioavailable I don't know okay, and you think Excel go may have used it as well it may have did it have any potential abuse deterrent reason to be in either Oxycontin or in Exile do I don't know action of one all right, and your comment too, what mr. Hughes wrote to Joanna was another reminder of who we are dealing with and why our industry has the problems it does, we must lead right we Covidien correct and, who we were dealing with was Purdue, the industry in general quite frankly and why did you art Morelli believe that in 2020 11, the industry the pharmaceutical industry or more narrowly the opioid pain space which one were you targeting injection of one well this email was about the opioid pain space but I was making a more general statement, okay not to exclude opioids but to include them in that and explain to me your phrasing of this is why our industry has problems why don't have the primary article here so I really can't comment definitively on that but the overarching statement is, you don't have an abuse deterrent indication don't try to petition your product as abused to turn well in from the art Morelli who has, appeared today don't make that statement without showing data that supports it corrected even if your data even if you have data that's helpful but it's not definitive you have to have the indication to promote and position your product as of used to turn and so, were you, expressing, your frustration and having to be in competition with a company who you thought ignored the principles of Pharmaceutical, safety and Reporting objection to form not so much no I would just think rather than compare ourselves to other companies we just know what's right and we have to lead with what we know is right, and what was the industry-wide problem that you were referencing objection to form, well it's quite well known that the perception of the public perception of pharmaceutical industry is pretty low and stunts like this can't possibly be helpful that's what I was thinking of when I wrote this, and mr. Hughes wrote back that he agreed right did you ever sit down and have a discussion with mr. Hughes I don't recall about this series of events I had many discussions with mr. Hughes but not not specifically about this that I remember okay, when you decided to leave Mallinckrodt, part of it you said was, not wanting to remain in st. Louis correct it was it was a big part the biggest part actually okay you also though had or just into the not the launch but the development of excel go correct oh no we're going to form well after the launch okay and you put in your Rams put in the Realms of Realms of fully approved and in place the cares Alliance was fully developed and, because it launched in 2010 at the pain week meeting and the team was in place established and you know it's like I guess leaving it leaving it at your Peak kind of concept, how did it is alko Du did you keep track of your little baby after you left objection form, very very lightly if not at all you know maybe in a discussion on the phone with herb here and there but that would that would be about it I never saw data or I never really had any insights or did you get enough information to determine whether or not it had been a hit drug or a so-so drug or a drug that never quite caught on objection to form, I can't comment on that I don't know, is it still on the market, genericized yeah, then I do know genericized with the oros or genericized just as overalls tuner corals, okay, and what did you do immediately after leaving Mallinckrodt, laughter Mallinckrodt I worked with Paragon RX the Rems development company I'm various rims projects that they had throughout the industry especially almost exclusively the companies in California any of them opioids those Realms that you were yeah getting together yeah they were and where they branded opioids or were they, expanded have you ever had discussions with going back to work for Covidien know, has anyone else that we you had a good working relationship left Covidien and spoken to you about it, no you said that you had, maybe I overheard it talks with art Newman that you would have brought something up if you knew about it have you had discussions with the seat dr. Newman I've had many discussions with dr. Newman I've had many interactions with dr. Newman and I worked with dr. Newman on subsequent projects okay what have you worked with him on the Ohio State Initiative for cancer Enlighten the, advanced cancer Imaging company I think those are the only two and both of those are kind of long long duration kind of engagements as mr. Newman still at Covidien oh no he left after I did but soon after did you have her trade stories about your days at Covidien with dr. Newman sorry privileged and confidential, that's a new privilege that's not recognized but we were friends were friends our wives our families were friends so I'm assuming that you did have talks with him in which you said, unless you had no frustrations during the time when you were at Covidien here's what I couldn't take or here's what drove me crazy when I was at Covidien telling it to dr. Newman very little action to form dr. Newman moved to California from st. Louis we were became you know you know closer to each other on the map so there was more potential to interact with each other he's in the Bay Area, yeah but his wife's a doctor so we have a lot in common and we're just close friends and you know whenever you work anywhere there's always frustrations but, that I'm at a level of experience where I can kind of roll with the punches so they don't bother me so much having met you and spoken to you today it is as you said in an earlier answer that you had a very high principle and one of the things that I take away from being able to ask you questions today is that your personal approach to safety was it was an all or, thing bottom line thing that pharmaceutical companies needed to address especially in the open space did I get that right I tried to adjective form try to do that to the best of my ability yes and was there ever any frustration that could videon was not, as Ardent about that as you were judging the form I wouldn't I would say no you know whenever you're at a company and you're managing you know projects that are big expensive projects there can always be the potential for the feeling that you know well they going to continue and that's just the normal operations of things, but the Covidien you know I what I was doing was supported by herb, and the CEO tomb right I always felt like I had really good support and belief in the importance of what we were doing so they were very little on the frustration scale quite frankly and what you were doing during the time you were an employee was all if not exclusively greatly the majority in Excel go through it was young and and the cares Alliance, and you can't tell me haven't been able to tell me today much about what was going on in the generic opioids face even within Mallinckrodt truth I had very little interaction awareness knowledge with the generic business and the people in the generic business, let's go off the record for just a second time is 528 4548, we're back on the record the time is five fifty-one p.m. hey good afternoon mr. Marley how are you doing fine how are you great I am Trisha her svelte and I am an attorney representing the plaintiffs in Tennessee do you know anything about the Tennessee litigation no okay on before we get started I just want to Lodge our usual objections to late production of documents non-compliance with the mdl protocol and the other objections that we've lodged in the other, missions I'd like to renew them at this time we disagree with your characterization regarding our compliance with the mdl protocol we have complied but we know your direction okay great now we'll move on I'm okay so you don't have any awareness of the Tennessee litigation sir I do not okay, okay and you've been to Tennessee before is that correct I've been to Tennessee how many times did you say you've been I've been to Tennessee once in my life okay and with that for work no hey what was it for my daughter's swim meet at the University of Tennessee when she swam at Arizona State oh okay very good you haven't been to Tennessee for work for me you have not been to Tennessee for work no okay, okay I'm when you were talking earlier about hot spots for pill Mills you mentioned Florida obviously and then Kentucky and West Virginia would you consider both of those states to be in Appalachia fictional form I don't know really can I think they might be but I'll rephrase the question would you consider Kentucky and West Virginia to both be States contained within Appalachia yes okay and would you consider Tennessee to be part of the Appalachian, and region know and have you heard it all about pill Mills being a hotspot in Tennessee I have not, do you recall having any conversations with anyone about particular opioid abuse problems in Tennessee I do not, do you know what neonatal abstinence syndrome is I do and what is it to your knowledge neonatal abstinence syndrome is a condition where newborn goes through opioid withdrawal because they were exposed in utero to the mothers consumption or use of opioids you know what region of the country has the highest number of Naas births no but I bet you're gonna tell me, happy if you don't know hey have you ever known no is that an information you've ever endeavored to obtain, would you be surprised to learn that Tennessee's number two directional form I would be neither surprised or disappointed or anything is it is what it is the data is what it is probably isn't is what it is though for those babies I don't know it's terrible it's a terrible thing have you ever seen videos of baby's going through withdrawal from opioids and performs I have seen some videos because of my work at Dupont with Narcan and dark and neonatal which is used in that setting, you and how would you describe watching those videos of those babies after they're born guess objection ghastly ghastly ghastly you think they're in pain objection to form don't know but they're in distress certainly, you knew that there was opioid epidemic specifically in Florida is that correct no it's not exactly correct I knew there were a lot of pill Mills the pill Mills that I were aware of we're in Florida and they were is an opioid epidemic you know an opioid problem was more pervasive than just Florida okay yeah and, I'm going to show you what number are we on for exhibit okay well we will Mark and number 22 great thank you, okay mr. murali what I've handed you here appears to be an email from person named Chris De Fusco do you know who Krista Fusco is I do and who's Christopher Fusco he is an employee at Mallinckrodt in the, think of the business development I think is what he was in when I was there okay and on Business Development did he handle any of the opioid product so okay and just for the folks on the phone and the record that Bates number on this is mnk hyphen T1 underscore 00:06 317 909 it's a one-page document and what is the date on this email mr. murli 3 29 2010 okay, this email is sent to Deborah Hass Hass Hass can see and speak to you and to David silver is that right okay and who is Deborah hasse she was a co-worker of Krista Fusco okay and so she was a mailing proud employee yes okay and David silver he was the Deborah and Chris reported to David silver okay and so David silver was also a Mallinckrodt employee okay and this email was sent to the three of you on March 29th 2010, n is that correct that's correct okay do you have any reason to think that this email wasn't sent to your email address no I'm sure it was okay I'm and what could you be the subject for me there please hey speaking of the subject News expose Oxycontin Florida and Tennessee okay and then what is the email site speaking to one of the folks I met from grunen Thal in Portugal in the training class in Barcelona last week about our paint products and he mentioned a News expose, out the problems with the abuse of Oxycontin in Florida and Tennessee and I thought you might find it interesting and then I do you speak Spanish at all I do not okay and so underneath that it says T2 though right oxy Express that what does that teach you to oxy Express red B TC oh okay very good okay and so do you know why it is that Chris would have sent an email specifically to you David and Deborah fictional form no I don't know why he sent it okay it did you respond, to this email I do not recall okay do you know if you ever had any conversations with anyone where you looked into an oxy abuse program or an oxy abuse problem in Tennessee I do not okay but according to this email which was 2010 the very least then you had received information about the oxy Express involving Florida and Tennessee is that an accurate statement I received this yeah I may be other things that I was exposed to all the way, okay but at the very least received this in 2010 I guess I did okay and can you think of anything else you might have been exposed to along the way that would have alerted you to an oxy abuse problem in Tennessee just news releases you know perhaps okay and I'm going to show you what will Mark is the next exhibit, 23:23, okay and this is oh yeah do you need a minute this is what happens when you mark them I'm sorry I'm a very fast just cough and then I'll slow down that's what they usually do with me, okay for folks on the phone this is mnk hyphen T1 underscore 00:07 2002 16 and it's a one to three page document, okay mr. Marley have you had a moment to look over this email, yes generally yes not in detail but yes okay let's kind of just go through it for for one second I'm not going to ask you to know everything in it does this appear to be an email that was sent from a person named Steven Littlejohn to you on February 19 2011 yes okay and it also copies Joanna schoolers that rights right and do you have any reason to believe you didn't receive this email in the ordinary course of business no I don't, the subject here is re wsj fight over a fix for Florida pill Mills do you see where it says that, yes okay and who is Steven Little John Steven Little John was a guy was the VP of the Communications Department for Mallinckrodt, for mailing don't cry and who is Joanna schooler she works in Little John's Department okay so also a male and crowd employee yes okay, and so if you look at the email that's being forwarded it looks like it says from Joanna kind of mid where the pages FYI more on the floor issue in Florida and the ongoing State funding debate will make contact with the reporter and that sent to a whole bunch of folks do you see that is that a yes, is that a yes that's yes yes okay sorry I have to get you to say yes it doesn't work on my transcript okay and then it looks like you reply on at 8:50 in the morning so it looks like, just shortly shortly there later I'm could you reach a response to Joanna there yes this article brings out some excellent points pro and con of pmps, the problems remain however, I see here a way for us to bring in a best practices orientation rather than a good or bad approach and our idea of changing the dialogue from problem identification and blame two solutions we need to contact Keith Humphries the Stanford PMP researcher named in the article Bobby and I can do that Bobby some of the works for me do you agree, okay and I reiterated education collaboration Innovation which is a strategy for the cares Alliance okay and so did did you ever reach out to the Stanford PNP researcher named in the article Keith Humphries I don't recall doing that now okay and do you know if I'm Bobby did I don't know okay, okay I'm, and then if you'll go down and actually read the article get to the second page here, you believe based on your email response to this that you did read this article that rights are at the time, I believe I did yeah okay so I'm just going to kind of bring you to some of the more pertinent points okay I'm going to ask you questions about the very first line in the article says State Line Miami do you see that very second the second page yes okay Florida Governor Rick Scott's called cancel a state drug monitoring program has sparked an uproar and Appalachian State's that say they are deluged with illegally bought pills from South Florida pain clinics do you see where it says that is, yes sir yes yes it is yes I see it yep okay and so was there a concern from Mallinckrodt about the PMP Pro State drug monitoring programs injection of Point can't speak for male and cried but I can tell you that I'm very I would be very concerned about the cancellation of any PMP program that I'm very concerned about the lack of utilization of pmps around the country okay and the delayed various problems with pmps it's one reason why they're not utilized and they're underfunded, they have problems with their data and speed of updating and that's a barrier to adoption for Physicians so there are potentially very valuable tool and then if you'll move down with me a little bit further on it says Jason Henry for the Wall Street Journal about halfway do you see there, no where were you at where you at oh I see the next one okay okay and then if you kind of keep going down it says pill Mills have flourished in Florida especially in Broward county in recent years week standards governing who can set them up a lack of oversight by state agencies and the absence of prescription monitoring programs have contributed to the problem said Sherry green chief executive of the nonprofit National Alliance for model street drug State drug laws did I read that correctly you did do you agree with that I agree with it, okay now the next one says according to the Florida Attorney General's office clinics are often casually Enterprises employing doctors who write prescriptions for painkillers without examining patients you see where it says I do and were you aware that that was happening it happens it happens yes it does okay and would you characterize situations where that happens is a pill Mill tricks in the Forum no not necessarily they could be but it certainly improper and could contribute to the diversion of, into the illegal drug Market absolutely and the next sentence there says they have proved to be a magnet for buyers in the Southeast period according to Frank Rapier director of the Appalachian high intensity drug trafficking area highway patrol offers officers and hot spots like Eastern Tennessee routinely Stop Van loads of people returning from Florida with fresh stock piles of prescription drugs did I read that correctly she did and does this, refresh your recollection at all about whether Tennessee was identified as a hotspot clearly what they're saying here it is okay and had you heard of the Appalachian high intensity drug trafficking area never heard of it no okay and do you know who Frank Rapier is I do not have you ever had a conversation with him I have not okay but you agree with this statement that Florida was a hot spot for those drugs to be brought up into the illegal drug Market direction of one I do agree, and specifically into the illegal drug Market in Eastern Tennessee, yes what it says here I have no basis to do so agree with it okay and then in the next line it says in West Virginia state senator Evans Jenkins Evan Jenkins said flights on discount Airlines between Huntington West Virginia and Fort Lauderdale Florida have been dubbed the Oxycontin Express and before I think we you'd been asked if you'd heard the term Oxycontin Express or oxy Express and I don't remember what your inside I hadn't heard okay and have you heard of ice, 75 being designated as the oxy Express injection before - I have not okay, okay can take this document and set it aside please we done with this one yes sir, I'm going to hand you the next exhibit which will be marked as exhibit number 24, there's that, I don't know that I have as many Kathy's here guys have to share, okay for the record this is mnk hyphen T1 under two of these well you got to, underscore 000 429 8470 and it puts you page document, okay sir some very familiar with this okay what is it sir so this is this is an agenda for a quarterly Rems safety board meeting these occurred quarterly okay with our panel of experts we where we presented data they for their review and feedback and action items that we would take and make, into actionable plans okay and if you will look here on the very first page the speaker that's designed from 9:35 a.m. to 950 AM that you that's me okay and did you indeed speak at this I did okay and does this maybe refresh your recollection as to whether you've been to Tennessee for business I forgot about Nashville I've been actually I've been to Nashville many many times I just completely forgot about you have you know most people don't forget Nash I know I'm really sorry because I've been to Nashville Maybe, and times and I just blanked out that's okay so why don't you tell me other than this will come back to this agenda okay and just a second but the other times that you've been to Nashville has that been for business or for personal both it meant mainly business and when I worked for Cardinal Health Cardinal Health had a big facility in Nashville okay it was a third party Logistics distributor company I used to go there you know you know a number of times, it's okay and so when you were working for Cardinal Health and you would come to Nashville for that distribution issue or meetings did any of that have to do with the diversion of opioids and the prevention of diversion of opioids okay okay and so other than your time with Cardinal Health and other than personal times other than this meeting that we just talked about have you been to Nashville for business reasons for any other times, not that I can remember no okay and so let's go back to this meeting then that you had here on April 8th and 9th 2011 at the Loews Hotel in Nashville is that correct that's correct okay and do you recall that lows being across the street from Vanderbilt University I do checks because I went running on the campus it's pretty and it's beautiful yeah it's very good okay so I'm looking at this agenda I see that it's you speaking and then we have some other folks I just want to make sure I understand who they are I think, already a discussion about Lynn Webster so I don't think we need to ask about Lynn that's the same limb Webster that was discussed earlier is that correct okay and what about Herbert Newman who is the chief medical officer of kovarian okay direct supervisor and so he would be a Covidien Mallinckrodt employees all right yes okay and then Daniel Burrows who is Daniel Burrows Danielle was a pharmacist and worked in pharmacovigilance at Mel, grunts okay and then Bobby Clarke who is Bobby Clarke Bobby Clarke is an epidemiologist to was on my patient and product safety team not a Mallinckrodt employee yes was a melancon employer he was he was okay I'm Julie Milford who is Julie Milford I actually don't know okay how about Jeanne Wang NBA Kenny Wayne worked for me okay so on the patient product safety team so she would have been mown Crowder for the unemployed, okay, I think that covers everybody that was on the list is that sound correct it does okay and so the people who attended this conference would that have been on just people that run on your Advisory board or would have been open to other positions or no driver's it was it was a the purpose of the meeting was to present data on the use side effects reported problems program success of the example gold rims, and Exile go to these experts for their to give them an opportunity to weigh in on the data and give us their impressions of what was really happening behind the data so they were interpreting the data okay and who were the experts injection of form it was Deborah Gordon was one David Brushwood I think I went through this before they want me to tell you who they were or is it the same less that you went there before what, yeah and there were others I can't remember all but there were a few more yeah okay and do you know if there were any Tennessee prescribers that were there oh no prescribers would, Tennessee prescribers prescribers were not invited to the meeting okay I'm do you know if there was anyone who was from Tennessee for based in Tennessee that was at the meeting at the time I don't know exactly but at the time Steve pasok may have been an employee at Vanderbilt I know it one time he was but I don't know if at this particular time he was working at Vanderbilt and you can set that aside, thank you sir, okay I'm going to hand you will Mark as collected exhibit 25, together I think the boys do here, okay for the record I just handed mr. Morelli what we've marked as plaintiffs exhibit 25 the Bates number is MN K Dash T 1 underscore 000 790 1956 looks like, like they have copies of email twice I don't know if you guys have two pages or one but it should be a one page email with an attachment, and the attachments placeholder page is mnk hyphen T1 underscore 000 790 1957 so it's email and attachment okay mr. Morelli if you'll just take a look at the email for one second for me please, okay you see the email I do okay and this is an email that was sent from Regina Ruben to you and it looks like a whole bunch of other people on October 8 2009 is that correct that's correct okay and do you have any reason to believe that you didn't receive this email in the ordinary course of your business no, so you believe that this email is something that you received I do okay and so who is Regina Ruben Regina Ruben is in was an employee of farm Paragon RX the consulting firm we use to run everybody through the RX f ma a process in terms of building safe use tools okay and Jeremy steamer do you know who that is Jeremy steamer is a melon crowd employees and a date, the analytics division of prescription data analytics in Mallinckrodt and what is prescription data analytics do so data comes in through a data service and it's quite voluminous and people like Jeremy steamer and his team would would get inside the data and kind of translate raw data into kind of usable actionable information understandable information rather than a page full of numbers, okay yeah okay and if you look at this email looks like Regina is forwarding something to you and a bunch of other folks on where it says attached is Jeremy Steamers presentation from this morning's core team TC thanks Regina did I read that correctly and do you know what she's referring to when she's talking about a core team TC injection of them I do not know what TC what the context in which he's using TC maybe it's core team backwards or something I don't know, no teleconference movie it could because we did it verbally and then he followed up with hard copies yet I think that's what it is okay and core team would be which team is that the co videon exha go Rems so let's look at this, so the the to the to line on this cover memo is a wait there's more job, so this is a laundry list of employees at Paragon RX and employees at Covidien who were involved with the RX-7 be a process okay okay now if you'll flip with me to the this is the attached I'll submit to this is the attachment we've printed out here the PowerPoint on let's take a look at the first page, the title page here it says exalt go Rams which I think we talked about a lot already today a commercial analytics perspective what is a commercial analytics perspective correction form so, in the process of operating the rims operationalizing the rims we need to collect data that, tell us who's prescribing the product how much product is being prescribed where it's being prescribed all those prescription data analytics because that data has to be presented to the exact algorithms safety board okay and that's data we use to try to understand if the product is being used appropriately at least from a data analytics perspective and if there's any hot spots or things that look, bad we need to dig into that further okay because that would be responsible thing for Mary Pratt to do if you have that data want to dig into it further and find out if your product is being abused or misused or diverted is that right direction to form okay okay I can page, okay Market overview data and information needs and implementation strategy yes switch to the next one okay then it talks about Market overview do you know what's meant by market overview, Market overview is how the company has segmented the market and where they're going to send sales reps okay so part of part of part of responsible responsible use is targeting the right Physicians not targeting Physicians who have no reason, by their specialty or by with their practice to prescribe Excel go a sales rep can't be in that office because there's nothing good can come from that because they're not seeing chronic pain patients okay at least on the surface okay so it says Market overview prescribers and then targeting and scope introducing introducing dr. Marc Murphy then pharmacies chains Independence mail-order specialty and hospital so, so does that generally is that match with your understanding of what the market was for Mallinckrodt branded opioid product yes okay next page, I'm talks about Market overview here and volume segmentation did I read that correctly yes okay and then it talks about these different product families which I think you'd already discussed earlier so I won't spend a lot of time on that but suffice it to say you got oxycodone morphine fentanyl in alpana did I summarized that correctly Oxycontin yeah okay morphine products fentanyl products and oh panel okay and then it, facts about a prescriber audience greater than 325 thousand active prescribers do you know what that means that the the, potential number of prescribers who would be the called on audience could be as large as that, but and these are the metrics that we use to analyze that target market and to break that Target Market down into more sub-targets might say okay and when you say called on is that sometimes also referred to as being detailed it is okay and so then this breaks it down by various deciles and then it looks like there's 10 different death Styles is that your understanding that's 10 the cells are always intense okay, and so people that are a decile 10 for this prescriber those would be the highest prescribers right in the form okay okay next one, let's admit segmenting Physicians by-product use, identifying Physicians predisposed to prescribing one product one product written 50% of the time or more did I read that correctly you did okay and do you know what that means yes it was is trying to create an understanding of which of those Physicians were essentially using one product or were prescribing multiple products to their patient population okay and when you friends on their habits and their comfort level okay and so when you're talking about products, is that opioid products you're looking at every single prescription oh no these are just long-acting opioids just long-acting opioids long-acting long I think okay search the next one, segmentation survey, so looking at this one says among deciles 2:50 the spreader segment is the largest do you know what that means, the spreader segment was a, descriptor intended to identify that went with the segment that's spread their use across product types as you can see there as opposed to head dominant of one or the other okay I see so there's spreaders that use that will prescribe multiple opioids within their practice and then there's other folks that were called more dominant groups and they prefer one right okay and then so, that would make sense then for that second bullet which then says dominant groups oxycodone prescribers are the most loyal with an average share of 70% for Oxycontin in your understanding is that's accurate that's okay okay next page manually tuning the segmentation increases the overall coverage of the market without compromising the strategy do you have any understanding of what that, means, I just think it's saying that you have the raw data and then it's tweak somehow based on other criteria but I don't recall this at all okay and when they're talking about coverage of the market is it coverage of the market for sales, injection of porn coverage of the market in terms of the the intensity of prescribing which is very important to us okay and it's very important from a safety perspective total why okay so a high prescriber, has the potential to do more harm than a low prescriber okay so if I'm designing a safety program, I'm going to focus first step out the door I'm going to focus on the highest prescribers of example go because they have the potential to harm more patients than someone who writes one prescription and doesn't write another prescription for 6 months, it could take a lot of energy and time and money to get that position that's in West Bemidji Minnesota to fill out the eif and read the Rems and when we go there he says I I wrote One prescription for example oh I'm never write another I'd rather go to Freddy Smith over here in Indiana who writes 10 prescriptions a week and put my energy in on him in terms of Education okay so it's a it's reflects its real it's a reflex, based on what their prescribing activity is okay to make sense it does okay moving forward so then you have this next one which is this very colorful chart here and that's what that's talking about here right the various deciles of prescribers and what they tend to prescribe it is that right section of okay, okay and then switching to the next page self Salesforce sizing were you involved at all in determining the sizes of the sales yes okay did anybody ever consult with you about sizes of the sales for no okay Switching to the next one okay then it says profile of a Target introducing dr. Murphy do you know what a Target is in this context, sorry, so this this is a profile, of an hour prescriber within a luster t''v profile of a prescriber and what that prescribers prescription activity is okay and when it says that a Target does that mean a sales Target for exalted sales Target okay okay yes which would meet in and out I think you're on you're ahead of me I was on this one so I'll switch to this life okay same page now we're on the same page okay the top it says dr. Marc Murphy and then the prescriber any and a perfect, a number do you know what a prescriber and the is medical education number okay is that a license number it's a designation that Physicians have that can be tracked so it's a way to track them okay and then here it says Market decile 10 is that right that's right and that's the highest decile number for mail and crop rankings is that right that's right okay and so what does that mean he's he's in the top, he's in a group of Physicians who collectively prescribed, get this right, 10% of the highest prescribers in the top 10% of prescriptions so in other words there's some of their make up a number 5,000 prescriptions how many doctors is a-tickin generate 5,000 prescription will the top 10% it only takes 32 of them the next is style make take 50 in the next cycle 250 you know something dump the puck, Galatians get bigger in each decile as you go down okay so if I understand your testimony rate so this dr. Marc Murphy would be in the group of the highest prescribers of long-acting opioids the highest yes okay and so if I understood you correctly before that means he is at the highest possibility of doing the most harm reduction of one correct okay okay that's how I look at it the sales guys look at it is this is the, a place where we can get the most prescriptions because they already believe in long-acting opioids they have the patience for long-acting opioids I look at it the flip side I look at it you're right that's why I have to get this exact ago Rems information and the example goal cares Alliance information in there okay okay and then it says that this this Doctor's practice location is the north Alabama Pain Services and Decatur Alabama, do you know anything about the north Alabama Pain Services and Decatur Alabama election, hey switching to the next one is this what you were talking about for specialty makes a difference for you yes okay and so what is dr. Marc Murphy specialty according to this chart anesthesiology okay and it's anesthesiology and the type of practice you'd expect to see high prescribing of opioids if they practice pain management not only anesthesiologist practice pain management some practice in the hospital and they give anesthesia during surgery there they, would not be a Target but an anesthesiologist the other part of anesthesia is they become a pain specialist okay and treat patients with chronic pain okay, okay Switching to the next one and talks about pharmacies, do you know what this chart or what this what this slide represents here reaction, let me back up yeah do you know if Mallinckrodt was also looking at where a particular Physicians prescriptions were filled yes we making sales determinations yes okay and so in this case it looks like when profiling dr. Marc Murphy there's a discussion about chain pharmacies Independent Pharmacies mail order pharmacy is ETC is that right or drugs or deformed, I believe so I can't be sure whether it's Marc Murphy or whether it's pharmacies and chains in general I can't tell from this okay but to your understanding Mallinckrodt did track where it is that various positions, prescriptions for drugs all go were being filled right because if put yes they did okay and do you know why they track that information sure because if a physician in Decatur Alabama and there's let's say there's one main Pharmacy in Decatur Alabama writes a script for example go and the patient takes it to the Decatur Alabama Pharmacy and they don't have that exact logo that patient is extremely unhappy because remember that patients in pain right that patients going back to the doctor with a bit, complaint what about for the patients who actually aren't in pain that are just trying to get the drugs from the doctors objection if they can't get the drugs from the doctors and get a prescription from the doctors but they can't get the drugs from the doctor then they have to go to the pharmacy and get it filled that's where the PNP comes in it and that's for the PMP come here and they have to get it I'm behind okay she can't get the drugs from the doctor, they can get the drugs from the pharmacies with the prescription written by the doctors that correct that's correct okay our Focus was on proper prescribing that's the faucet goes open or closed okay,and if you switch to the one that says Ren's metrics and tracked data do you see that okay and it talks about enrollment do you know what they were talking about here with enrollment section of the form I believe it's enrollment in the Rems the exact algorithms so is that the filling out the sheet thing we talked about earlier is there anything more than the eif, there's more but it's so we what can we track we can track the eif because we have it you can track their prescription activity because we have it okay and then we justify those two against each other and if we have a prescriber that doesn't have any iif we sent people in there okay okay so then we'll just flip all the way here to the to the end says strategic approach Rems implementation and then there's this chart on the very, last page the chart, a colorful chart now we want to make sure did you create this trial God knows I wanted to just make sure that I understand it so this goes we have the physician to and then it says rxo the physician writes the prescription to the patient yes right okay and then the patient there's an arrow that goes to the pharmacy with RX so does that mean fills the prescription feels the prescription at the pharmacy and then there's, the arrow going the other way with the pills so the pharmaceutical back to the patient okay and then it has the manufacturer sends the pills to the pharmacy you see down the leaves out a step there because it goes to the wholesaler first but effectively it goes to the pharmacy okay and then, here between the pharmacy and the physician there's a thing called database what's the database do you know, the, database is a representation of all the data analytics that go on it's not a really a box Earth a single thing it's a global kind of thing okay and so it talks about eligibility of prescriber and patient you know what that is that's the eif on on on file for that prescriber okay and, and then going the other way from Pharmacy to database it says enroll Pharmacy do you know what that is, that I believe is a pharmacy that reports reports data not all pharmacies do but today nearly all do okay and then all the way at the bottom there's an arrow going from database to database to manufacturer and it says eligibility of Pharmacy do you know what that is, that's a way for us to check whether we're sending drug indirectly because we're sending it through a number of steps But ultimately its destination is an eligible Pharmacy a real Pharmacy illegitimate Pharmacy because you would want to make sure that your drugs aren't getting to illegitimate furnaces and you want to make sure that your opioids aren't getting two doctors who are prescribing them for inappropriate perfectly injection would want to make sure that, your opioids aren't getting to an illegal drug Market where they're being abused objection to form absolutely, do you know anything about dr. Marc Murphy no nothing do you know if dr. Marc Murphy still has a medical license now original idea I don't even know if he's a real doctor may have been made up just to illustrate a point I really don't know yeah, this is an educational settings may not have been real, so if Mark Murphy was real do you know if he ever filled out the REM survey you're asking me to speculate he just told you is never heard the name before, what would happen if you asked a physician to fill out the ram survey and they didn't, what would happen or could happen or yes variety of things okay, you know I can give you a spectrum of kind of responses that we got but that's just that's what you're looking for sure some would do it instantly yep some would want to understand why they're doing it some would say come back another day and I'll do it some would say I'm never going to do this, any others like that you know in that neighborhood so if someone was like I'm never going to do it or they came up with a million excuses to just never really turn it in with that information that you would collect oh absolutely and is that information that you would turn over to other folks at Mallinckrodt perhaps eventually but we would make multiple efforts to reason with the individual physician or to get his staff to help do it often works you have to be crafty, do you think it could be suspicious if a if a physician didn't want to get share that information injection of form it could be it could be the that the physician it's more than likely that the physician is suspicious about signing anything that goes to a pharmaceutical company couldn't it also be that the physician doesn't want to share information about their prescribing habits because perhaps they're not legitimate objection to form it could be but we have their prescribing habits, it's with or without the we don't need the I have to get them and they probably know that but it's amazing some don't okay during your time at Mallinckrodt did you ever identify any prescribers that you suspected were prescribing for illegitimate purposes, I didn't but we had multiple instances of such kind of activity that we you know flagged certain prescribers based on their prescription activity and sent in healthcare professionals to try to investigate not only other prescribing activity but adverse event occurrences where that the physician was the you know the physician relevant to the patient that had a severe adverse event okay and who would have been responsible for that amount, I cry for going into the doctor's office yes sir usually Eddie Darton who is a physician or one of our farm farm Dee's depending upon the severity and the location okay so I'm gonna kind of and shift just a little bit because I want to make sure that I understand it if I understood your testimony earlier you were talking about training of salespeople to detect signs of diversion did Ryan do I remember that correctly, no not to detect signs of diversion because they wouldn't really have that opportunity except if it's a pill Mill that we train them to detect pill Mills which something you can do visually from the parking lot who was responsible for that training a medical Affairs okay so that would have been in your purview, more more the healthcare professionals and I would would cooperate on it yeah okay and was there was there a program on training then there was a complete training program yes with videos and examples and pictures and things yeah okay so if I went to look in Mountain crowds documents I could find that somewhere like some packet do you know what it was called okay on and so it contains within that and the training of the salespeople, able to spot pill Mills will call it that if you're more comfortable with that do you know who specifically did the training on that I think we, I did a lot of the rep training on Remsen cares Alliance so it's more than likely I did some of it but there was follow-up from others in medical Affairs okay and do you know who created that program where it came from the training yes we did we did and do you know who Karen her fur is I know the name I don't know her personally okay did Harper did you, with anyone on on the generic side of Mallinckrodt and developing those signs to look for did not okay where did you get the information that you train folks on how to spot pill Mills just from data literature personal experience recommendations of experts it's compilation of things okay yeah and with those salespeople be trained just, when they started over there periodic training both okay it's heavy when they start and then there's follow-up training never stops in Pharmaceuticals because things change okay and what was your Salesforce instructed to do if they thought they had spotted signs that there was a pill Mill don't go in there don't have anything to do with them and report it to us okay and what types of things where they trained to look for reaction to form, doctor's office next door contig contiguously constructed with a pharmacy long lines of patients outside the door of the physician's office patients spending five minutes or less in the physician's office coming out and going next door to the pharmacy filling a prescription getting in a getting in their car driving away a large number of out-of-state license plates, I'm sorry I thought I turned it off, long lines of out of state, license plates on cars those types of things okay and so when you said they should report it who would they report it to generally to their management first that would get kicked up line and eventually would end up at us and medical medical Affairs okay and what what type of actions would begin at Medical Affairs of report, first is avoidance so that we wouldn't have anything to do with it make sure that we weren't selling product into those pharmacies we weren't interacting with those Physicians and I'm not sure how often it bubbled up to reporting them to the medical board but I know what other companies that I consulted with on this same kind of issue that had opioids we reported him to the medical board I can't remember that happened at kovarian or not okay and what about reports to the DA while you were a comedian do you know if those Sakura, if I don't I don't know okay and what about reports to Tennessee law enforcement do you know if that occurred I do not know okay do you recall any events of anybody reporting suspected pill Mills or signs of diversion in Tennessee during your time I do not, did a Mallinckrodt have a do not call list, do you know of any Physicians from Tennessee Ron that list I do not know that do you know how many Physicians approximately run that list, without being named specifically there was a huge do not call segment of the prescribing potential prescribing population because they didn't meet the standards that we set for their specialty or their patient population so there was no justification for having a sales rep in there okay so mostly you you folks spent your time on the Physicians that were, describing the highest level of long acid acting opioids objection of form and not just that and had the right training so you're starting out with a select group that's kind of automatic risk mitigation because these are pain experts as opposed to some doctor who hasn't had the training who is just a high prescriber that's a danger that's a danger sign so, hi prescribers of long-acting opioids who had a specialty like pain management anesthesia pain management Etc yeah okay and that's where most of the focus was for sale right okay, okay I think I understand it now I've just got a little bit more for you maybe either he's going to run out, for this though I don't think it'll work you think so okay maybe we'll see okay give me one second okay well Mark this next one is plaintiffs exhibit 26 26 26,I only have just a couple questions okay so it might be easier if I just ask you the questions first we'll get you out of here a little faster okay on for the record exhibit 26 is Bates number and then K hype and T1 underscore 000 631 4936 with the, judgment that is for 937 okay Phil take a look at the first page which is the email for me sir yes I have okay and this appears to be an email that is that from Preston Walker and to a bunch of folks and then copy is Bobby Clarke in you is that correct that's correct okay and it's dated to 14 2011 is that correct that's correct okay and do you have any reason to do believe that you receive this email and the regular course of your, - I do okay so it says here PPS and I think you said what that meant earlier patient product safety okay Bobby and I were asked to put together a training module for the upcoming Advance sales training please review the attached presentation and return comments to me by Co be on Tuesday to 1511 thanks Preston did I read that correctly you did okay now let's just flip through this, on thing here, okay if you look at on slide number 9 its page number 9,did you create this document sir I did not I reviewed it participate in creating a but I didn't actually physically create it okay if you will read for me what it says on, slide 9 here federal law enforcement authorities in November 9 2009 dismantle the Florida drug trafficking ring that had sent more than 190,000 oxycodone tablets from South Florida pain clinics to abusers in Kentucky North Carolina Tennessee Virginia and West Virginia at least 20 people were indicted on distribution charges the ring had allegedly operated for three years and used at least four or five Clinic doctors per day per day to obtain the drugs members of the Ring ship thousands of, pills every day by vehicle or overnight delivery services and allegedly made at least five million dollars over three years okay and the citation for that is the National Drug Treatment assessment to present ten is that correct that's correct do you know who the National Drug Treatment assessment is it's what it is, not exactly but it's a national kind of initiative to address this problem okay consider it to be a reliable source I don't know I can't comment on that but I'm assuming it would be okay do you have any reason to doubt what you just read oh no no I have no reason to doubt okay so in this case the information that you just read talks about federal law enforcement arresting people for engaging in a conspiracy to sell 190,000 oxycodone tablets, tablets is that correct that's correct perform okay and it says that those were coming from south Florida pain clinics to abusers and Kentucky North Carolina and Tennessee is that right that's correct and and Virginia and West Virginia just to be complete yep it does that indicate to you that oxycodone tablets for going from South Florida playing clinics into the illegal drug Market in Tennessee absolutely okay and it says at least 20 people were indicted the ring operative, years and used at least four or five pink Hunter Clinic doctors per day to obtain the drugs is that right yes ok and when it was talking before it was talking about pain clinics is that right yes okay so in this situation you had people doctors who were pain management doctors at pain clinics is that right direction of one but it is I understand it these were this is this is basically the pill Mill practice okay so I guess my question is if you're talking, talking about targeting folks or sales that are high prescribers of long-acting opioids who are also in an appropriate and appropriate Specialties like pain management that could be a pill Mill they could be operating a pill Mill or it could be legitimate is that right absolutely okay and when you're targeting them do you know if they're a pill Mill or a legitimate operation not not initially we need to do more due diligence, a chance to find that out to verify that where they're going is legitimate and the reps are trained for telltale signs that as I talked about before okay and what would happen if a rep saw those signs and didn't report it objection to form and didn't report it, and then it was discovered later is that what you mean they'd be in a lot of trouble, okay you can set this one aside, I think I'm going to be pretty quick so unless you want to switch but I think that might be, cat looking through my Roundup okay I've got one more one more real quick and if it looks like you need to stop just let me know okay okay, okay number 27 it's actually 27 and 28 so let's mark them at the same time if that's okay because they kind of go together, and we'll just do 27 first, that's okay, yeah but we've marked as exhibit 27 which is an email on Bates number mnk hyphen T1 underscore 00 07 09 4004 and it is a three page email, a three-page email chain sir is this an email that was sent to you from Kevin Lena Berg on June 8 2011 yes okay and did you receive this email in the ordinary course of your business assume I did yes okay and so I questioned about this is actually pretty pretty easy on if you'll just set this down for a second and then we can talk about it in a minute I'm do you know the, book called defeat chronic pain now I do have you read the book I've read parts of it I've perused it I haven't read it word for word okay and did the cares Alliance provide copies of defeat defeat chronic pain now to prescribing Physicians we did amongst other books yes okay what other books did you prescribe did you provide doctor Fisherman's book on risk management, mint I think those are the two main ones that we did okay and other than prescribing Physicians to defeat chronic pain now go to other folks as well defeat chronic pain now was a book that we gave to Physicians to give to their patients okay on and I should have asked you before this is just an aside and I'm sorry to kind of go off a little bit on but when we were talking about detailing of Physicians did to your knowledge did Mallinckrodt sales folks also detail pharmacies, I don't know really did you ever hear about on perhaps Mallinckrodt detailing pharmacies to make sure that they had exalt go on their shelves in case of physician wrote the prescription I believe that I believe that happened okay initially that's kind of up front at the launch but once it's done it's you have to go back anymore okay and did you have responsibility for training sales folks to detail pharmacies I did not know okay do you know who would have sales training department, ain't okay okay so we don't need to look at this email if you know that you already provided defeat chronic pain now okay on looking at defeat chronic pain now, it, have you gone back and read defeat chronic pain now since you left Mallinckrodt subjection of home okay do you know if any of the claims and defeat chronic pain now have been disproven I do not know that okay on they talk about pseudo addiction and defeat chronic pain now do you recall that I do recall that yeah because pseudo addictions and issue okay and what do you mean it's an issue I mean it's a concern that people have how to deal with patients that are presenting with sudo addiction, do you believe pseudo addiction to be a legitimate scientific I'm not the one to judge that but enough Physicians tell me it's an issue or told me at the time I don't talk about it now but told me at the time it's something they have to deal with do you know if that's true I don't know if it's true okay do you know of pseudo addiction actually exists okay did the FDA approved the label for eggs that did the FDA approved label for example go mention anything about, do addiction to your knowledge my not my belief is they did not okay, okay and do you know if defeat chronic pain now is available online I don't know, I don't think I have any more questions thank you very much sir,we're back on the record the time is 7:02 p.m. Miss Rowley thank you for your time so far I just have a couple of questions for you what was your role on the suspicious order monitoring team my role was to inform them of what the patient and product safety team was doing in terms of the Rems Exile Go Rims and the cares Alliance to make them aware of what we were doing did you have any involvement with suspicious order monitoring, I of generic opioids I did not did you have any knowledge or understanding of how the suspicious order monitoring program for generic opioids worked at Mallinckrodt not really what was the goal of the sales force at Mallinckrodt to to visit with prescribing physicians in their target audience and inform them of the risks and benefits of their promoted products during your time at Mallinckrodt did you have any role, in chargebacks I did not and do you have any understanding of how chargebacks work at Mallinckrodt I do not thanks Ted, you just were asked question about the sales forces task at Mallinckrodt you recall that just now yeah and that they were to mix with doctors and give them risks and benefits correct correct did you have any role in following up to see if the Salesforce stuck to that assigned tasks or expanded their, discussions with doctors know but others did, who the sales organization the legal department medical Affairs other than me and Cetera, okay nothing perfect okay thank you",0.8508189348529414,0.5703738,0.91283894
gghb0039,"now what was the cost of all this this chart shows the combined earnings for Philip Morris r.j. Reynolds and American Tobacco in those those are the three companies that we that we have easiest access to their domestic tobacco earnings number and what you can see is from 1990 on through 92 for those three companies which are more, or less representative of in a train sense of what the what the industry profitability would look like this are steadily increasing earnings in early 1993 that began to decline partly as a result of some of those prior earnings having been inflated particularly for Philip Morris by trade loading and their volume was beginning to fall off pretty sharply in early 1993 same was true for, our American but once the promotional activity began to take place very precipitous decline on through the third quarter where the rate of earnings was literally less than half of what it was last year and the fourth quarter folks is going to be even worse so the cost to, Industry profitability of these pricing moves has been has been enormous Philip Morris just yesterday announced a revision to its to its full-year forecast as you know they said that they would be down 40% up to 40% in domestic tobacco for the year 1993 every way that we cut the numbers suggested it was more like 40, 85% and we couldn't figure out how they could get to 40 Without Really ramping up the loading again and we thought that really is crazy so so rich and Roger you were absolutely right they have now revised their earnings forecast to precisely meet yours and so they will be down, in earnings this year percentage-wise more than more than we will, all right let's look at our results first nine months it's not a particularly representative number because we've got one full quarter at the old prices and then parcel prices and so forth so this is where we were a year to date volume down 1.8% for the nine month period and here's what we're expecting for the full year that overall our shipment volume will be done 4.3%, went with some erosion of that very high level share level we had in savings and we'll talk more about that later and why that is actually in our view somewhat of a of a positive because of the waste and friends are playing at net sales reflective of part-year price reduction off 21 percent or about one point one or two billion dollars and, a 900 million dollar decline in business unit contribution 42 .5 percent versus revised number now for 45% for Philip Morris and probably greater declines for the for the smaller companies so, if you look at what the implications of this are for the competitive Outlook because the smaller players got hurt so badly during the price War both in full price and in savings savings the smaller players We Believe must do some discounting and promotion and get some price edges in order to stabilize their businesses, that they really almost have no other choice but to do that, here we have our Jr in the mix wanting to deescalate this price War wanting to to keep the Gap from opening back up again wanting to keep Philip Morris from bringing the hammer down again and doing something crazy and Philip Morris, I Believe by this time has learned that their strategy will not work how do I know that one they just revised their earnings down yesterday, now our responses to this, we have, almost immediately after April 2nd began to work on how this might play out and to look at some areas where the where the price decrease would become permanent and we pretty much concluded that it would become permanent the amount of the decrease in the timing of the decrease were unclear but we knew directionally that was going to happen there's been a huge amount of very successful work throughout the company in identifying savings, during the second part of 1993 a lot of non critical discretionary spending with stopped immediately as you know we've gone through a painful and difficult effort which resulted in staff reduction RJ are also led the effort for Price Point consolidation when we when we followed Philip Morris down on the, so price price reduction we did something a little different consolidating our 85s price up to the hundreds price point that was I think 30 cents a carton the annualized benefit from having done that has over 70 million dollars through despite all this turmoil in the marketplace, we were able to very successfully launched two new full price brand Styles camel special lights and select lights with those introductions have been even better if if we weren't in the midst of all the turmoil sure they would I think so but nevertheless successful introductions for both brand Styles we very quickly reduced are discounting and promotion, we have also very clearly improved our marketing cost Effectiveness we've also learned how to how to better leverage some of our high paid back marketing programs camel cash would probably be an example you're all familiar with that has proven itself cost effective because it brings in and retains competitive smokers, given everything I've said about about the environment in 94, we have to have a set of key assumptions on which we build the plan and here's what we look like they look like we have assumed that there will be some amount of unfavorable legislation in 1994 our objective is and continues to be to defeat any, Federal excise tax, to postpone if there is one any federal excise tax but if we had built a plan for 1994 and assumed that nothing was going to go wrong in terms of federal excise taxes and state excise taxes you probably would sort of tuned out on me right about that so all that was meant to do was to to assume something where it looks today is it looks like, we might even get all the way through 1994 before any federal excise tax becomes an issue we've also integrated the cost of imported Leaf restrictions, we've assumed that there is a moderation of the competitive environment we made what appears to be an excellent deception that there would be a small full price price increase, but the part we don't know about yet is lower full price discounting and foremost what we have seen since the price increases took effect a pretty dramatic reduction in discounting in full price if you go back to pre Marlboro Friday anywhere from the third to a half of all full price product was being promoted to one degree or another today that number is down to more like 10% and, I would expect it to stay there or even decline further last assumption and the Assumption here I think is absolutely correct the question is to what degree is it correct, what are our key objectives after my car purrs presentation you probably could have guessed this but but very important this is the right strategy for RJ Reynolds tobacco it's got nothing to do with Mike Harper Steve Wilson or anybody else this industry has lost its credibility, with the financial Community this company I believe is on the verge of losing its credibility with the financial Community we are now five years into the lbo, and we have not demonstrated continued progress on our surprise the way we gain credibility with Cheryl is going forward is earnings simple as that the kinds of objectives we have set for 1994 which I believe are achievable, will truly impress the financial community, because I think their expectations for Progress can be exceeded by the results that we can post in 1994 and there is nothing better than beating expectations, what is that go, get our business unit contribution up by 15% in 1994 and that will yield a number of 1.4 billion dollars in business unit contribution how do you do that,critically important for us to focus our energy on what can pay off for us as a company as I said before I think we have better knowledge than any other company in this industry on what will work for us in the marketplace what will generate positive returns promotionally, this issue of market share versus earnings all of our instincts all of our competitive instincts all of our historical instincts drive us towards Sharon wouldn't we all like to be the number one company again if we had a goal of being the number one company in this industry if that's what I put up on this chart, so you're serious man because that will blow up this industry that will blow up this industry anybody who single-mindedly focuses on market share growth in the 1990s in this industry is going to lose, third point we're not going at looking to give up market share we're not going on same here you guys take a little bit here you guys take a little bit but the problem we've had is as we respond to the little competitors in the business is that we, when we're responding to American Tobacco with it within a chair and we come in and match one of their activities it's the it's the 500-pound gorilla coming in when Philip Morris comes in its the 800-pound gorilla and that and the problem is when we respond across the board to those kinds of competitive actions we pull the whole Market down so we have to be, willing, to slowly count to three before we respond we have to find ways to respond more tactically, when we need to match a competitor do it by Outlet do it by local market instead of these across-the-board kind of responses so that says that suggest there is a risk to our volume and market share and we built that into our assumptions for 94 and it says very importantly we have to choose our battles carefully, well here's how much it costs have to go down in 1994, we are reducing our total cost base from 93 to 94 by little over 25%, Far and Away the bulk of that money is is in full price and savings marketing, a major component of that reduction has to do with the elimination of price discounting that is no longer required because we've taken it in terms of a net price reduction the best thing that's happened to Winston-Salem Fantage more and now is that their net price at retail is more competitive than it was before and so far on those Brands versus what we calculated, dated would be the impact the volumes are in fact running running better than we had had forecasted they would be well what does all this mean in terms of all the things we've been talking about for the last couple of years and wanting to be the best company in the business and I want to assure you there is no change in in our Jr.'s commitment to building long-term strength stability and profitability but in this new, fireman tie think being the best means being as profitable as we can, running our business at the least possible cost while remaining competitive doing all the right things that we need to do for this business and producing over the course of the next few years a superior profit Trend than any of our competitors it also means a continuous process not of taking this cost base, Dan 25% and then going to sleep at the switch but to continue to challenge the way we do things so that we can get ahead of our competitors on a cost base this is not an event or series of events it's a continuing management challenge for this entire group and product Innovation is another lever we have in your Marketplace because there are still plenty of, consumer, wants in cigarette products that aren't being met today and those companies which can best meet those needs are going to be much less susceptible to price Wars and couponing and all that sort of thing, I think it requires some new behavior on everybody's part we have to be more focused, we have to if you look at at some of our history we've sometimes kind of run from well analyze the heck out everything or we will just kind of say hey we all know this business and let's go and let's move quick and where we need a balance of analysis with judgment Jim steyer always talks with his folks about being 80% research safe, and what that means is you get enough analysis to be done to know that directionally you're moving correctly but you don't wait around for all the information to come in because it's probably going to be too late to move that balance and what we're all paid for is managers is that kind of balance of to know when we've got sufficient analysis and when we apply judgment and appropriate level of, risk and get it done in the marketplace it also means refocusing our time as managers and our people's time on, putting on the side those things that are it's this as an important you know hopefully we're not doing anything it's unimportant but those things that are clearly less important don't get in our way day-to-day and when you come in at 8:00 and then started consumes your day that you take charge and make sure we address those things that are important to achieving the objectives we're talking about finally I think it involves a continuation, Ian of the kind of approaches we've been talking about for a while which is managing Our People based on influence versus rigid control, in this new culture we have to constantly rethink our business we have to communicate our goals and progress that's what this meeting is all about that's what the meanings that that you need to hold with your folks are all about to say here's where we're trying to get into post people along the way of how we're getting there, everybody in this company needs to have a single-minded focus in 1994 on earnings, we have to continue to work to empower our employees and we have to continue our emphasis on teamwork and why is some of this important because we're going through real trauma in the company and many of the people in this room have had to deal with the sort of gut-wrenching issues of reducing headcount and whether a department was, acted or not it's had an impact throughout this company and here's start of a list of the typical kind of shock waves that come about after a restructuring of a company is a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity why are we doing this where are we going there's indecision there there usually is a fall-off in productivity as mistrust of company and management there's a loss of team spirit you got power struggles, as people try to figure out how do they gain Advantage politically in a new environment you clearly often get week commitment, and you get everybody hunkering down to try to avoid any risk, well those are the kinds of things that can prevent us from achieving the objectives we we talked about we need to, focus on getting on with our business and that means explaining to our people what our situation is as a company and if anybody in clear on that I want to make sure you are before you leave the room today, we have to, change the way we do business for all the reasons you've seen so far this morning do not dwell on the past, we've got to get on with this business we don't have time, and it ain't got to be productive for anybody to spend a lot of time chewing on that we've got to get focused on, moving the business forward and as Mike Harper said so well this morning you have to keep a sense of humor you have to keep the sensor you, we've got to work more than ever to build our people to empower them to continue training them we want to in a very personal way as well as institutionally facilitate the issues our employees have to deal with both you know we tend to think about the ones who are who are leaving and I think we do a great job as a company of supporting people's transition out of the, a company but we also need to focus on those folks who stay and what are their needs in this in this transition finally we have to we have to do everything we can to continue to communicate very clearly very frequently with our with it with all our people and so over and over again we need to talk to people about what we're trying to accomplish, I think there are a couple of real keys to motor motivating are people in this in this new environment, I don't know anybody that can understand a single-minded focus on earnings there is no ambiguity there is no ambiguity about results, we are gonna reward process we're gonna reward results, I'm going to need the very best from you and your people in every function of this company we have to continue to work to eliminate unnecessary costs to improve our margins are earnings and our future outlook, we have to continually look for new definitions of least possible cost, very importantly make sure your people understand that we are not cutting our costs to shrink this company, we are cutting costs to grow the company and that's an incredibly, important mindset that everybody has to have we're here to build a stronger business not not to milk it and we have to have a sense of commitment to that and urgency when we go about it you've seen that the negative impact that price reductions and earnings price reductions and earnings declines have had on a stock price but with signs already that we intend to respond aggressively and improve our earnings our stock is clearly started to, cover whether it continues to improve will depend on whether we actually deliver better results and delivering results means achieving our earnings goal in the 1990s in this industry winning means earnings, no question it will be a challenge it's a new environment and that means we've got to continue to look for new ways to win for a long time we've said and rightly so that RJ our people have a passion for winning we're being put to the test, but I think it gives us a chance to show what were made of I don't think we're the kind of people who back off from a challenge please accept this Challenge and prove once again that we are Builders of the future not by standards, the only thought I want to leave you with is let's go make some money, 1.4 billion has a nice room to me then let's have some fun doing it and let's be sure to communicate what we heard today well I'm very happy to be here today and to have this opportunity to talk about our gr tobacco International I'm very excited about working for a company as vital and dynamic as t.i. I've been made most welcome here Southern Hospitality at its best and I appreciate it, this meeting is timely in many respects the tobacco industry worldwide is in a period of Rapid change with economic social and government factors all playing a key role in shaping Marketplace Dynamics and closer to home for we at TI undertaking changes within the overall organization changes that I believe will strengthen the international company by making a sharper more efficient and better able to meet the challenges ahead, our principal objective over the last five years has been to strategically position the company for long-term growth while at the same time delivering strong earnings and cash flow growth and t i succeeded on both counts volume during this five-year period grew at a compounded annual rate of 11% earnings have compounded at a strong 23 percent per year, operating profit margin has improved more than five percentage points and cash flow has grown at a compounded rate of 20% while we continue to invest in upgrading and expanding the capacity of our production facilities, this ongoing success is driven by three key strategies that keep our sights fixed squarely uncontrolled high-quality earnings growth these strategies have proven sound in the past and will continue to work well for us this year and beyond for us to continue this momentum however we're going to have to think quicker act faster and be more entrepreneurial than our competitors we cannot rest on our Laurels and expect to remain competitive we can, never be satisfied, looking to the future I believe the prospects for our business continue to be excellent we're a growth company and a growing International industry a performance in recent years backs that up and I believe that strong growth will characterize a performance in the years ahead, ah Jia tobacco International will probably not be the biggest company in the industry not in the near term anyway but it will be known as the premier company throughout the industry it will be recognized as a leader in terms of strong growth earnings delivery and shareholder value it will be a leader in customer service and it will continue to be an exciting Dynamic and rewarding place to work, and when Jim and I are talking to the banks of the security analysts they do not diss they are not willing to take whatever you say at face value I mean you guys could you can't just get up there and make these wild claims about what you're going to achieve you got to have facts you got to have data you got to you got to really support your story and in the food business when we're pitching our sales growth story we build on two platforms the first is we try to convince them that we're a company, open with a lot of marketplace power and then the second thing we try to do is convince them that we got Superior marketing and the theory is that if I can make these Bankers these analysts believe that we're strong in the marketplace and if I can convince them that we got good marketing programs that maybe they will accept a story that we will be able to grow our sales, the first thing I point out to them is that in terms of sales were the fourth largest food company in North America only kgf ConAgra and S are larger I then go on to make the point that we've got 17 brands in the u.s. each with annual sales of over 100 million dollars a hundred million in the food business 100 Millions the level you got to get to to be what we call a power brand and power brands are vital to growth and 17 happens to be, a lot a lot bigger number than the power brands of our closest competitors and again this is relevant because every Power brand you have gives you an opportunity to do line extensions and French enfranchise extensions that you have more power Brands than the other guys gives you more platforms to build from, thankfully I usually focus on is are 12 core businesses these are these are 12 are 12 businesses that make up 90% plus of ourselves and the key point that I go on to make is that for seven of these twelve businesses were the market leader that those seven businesses do about 78 percent of our sales and then of the remaining four in a couple were a strong number two and I'm going to pause here because this is important in today's world there's absolutely nothing wrong with being a strong number, now that's what General Mills is and cereal that's what Pepsi is and soft drinks and candidly that's what you are in tobacco a strong number two position is still a position that you can you can do very very well in the marketplace what you don't want to be today is a week number two which you are not in our business I'm lucky I got a week number two Keebler is a week number two you'll see some stats on that in a minute but the Pepsi is in the General Mills and the RJ r--'s can all do very very, very well working from from a solid base a point I try to hit really hard with the analysts is that for those businesses what we are number one we really dominate the category let me explain how this slide works if you take that cookie category on the top we're number one and cookies of course we've got a 39 percent market share and that is three times larger than the share the number two competitor which of course is keeper so you know with three times larger than the number two guy I won't dwell on it but if you just run your eye, I down that dominance Factor call them you'll see that even in our weakest didn't number two number one positions were still almost double the size of the nearest guy in the game in fact in the seven categories where we're number one the average share of Our Brands is an impressive 45% and even those are these are very high shares obviously but they're still growing, today this year Brands representing almost 90 percent of our sales of actually increased their market share another statistic that it illustrates our dominance of the cookie I'm breaking it into pieces now cooking and cracker markets is that in both cookies and in crackers we got the trailer we were here and we are both cookies and crackers we've got the top four brands in each of those categories, The Descent the beginning the second platform that I try to build our sales growth story on is superior marketing and they're basically two thrusts that decision that claimed the first Jim mentioned thank you is new products and the second is our advertising that drives the sales of those products, new products new products are particularly important because everyone has come to realize in the US food industry if you're not successful new products you just not going to win the game and it's an area where our track record is very good I I close I close my remarks usually about new products with an important statistic which is that if you take products that have been introduced over the last 24 months on a rolling basis they'll do about 165 million dollars worth of business for us this year, again if you want to put 865 in a context for us 165 million is larger than sunshine sunshine being the number three company in the cookie and cracker business they turn 65 million dollars is larger than the sun shines total business so we're just new products along we have equal the number three competitor but of creating serious there aren't many opportunities for synergies that's a sad fact of life but again I'm not one to hide from realities but just because there aren't sort of tangible synergies in the marketplace doesn't mean that the, can't be what I consider to be sort of emotional support in both directions and I really do work very hard my side of the company to make sure that there is emotional support for everything you people are doing down here this is very important to us in the end my people with large shareholdings are very depend on how well you do and so I'll close with the thought that I think we've had an emotionally supportive relationship to date and I hope very much that that spirit continues thank you it's been fun to be with you today",0.8582370702803739,0.6964612,0.9128387
ggxh0257,"back on the record at 4:33 p.m., hey mister is vorta stassi's you say it yes okay you don't say Strasse in the German Way I don't know do other people say it that way sometimes okay my name is Tricia herzfeld and I am one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs and the Tennessee State litigation before we get started today I just want to put a couple of objections on the record I'm number one I think my objection to my time today being counted against the mdl has already been stated but I want to be very clear that we have, given plenty of sufficient notice to Mallinckrodt about Our intention to participate today in which we were invited by Mallinckrodt to participate here and it wasn't until 2:00 p.m. when the deposition was already well underway that Mallinckrodt is for the very first time raising this issue of having to share time with the mdl to which we of course subject secondarily as has been our ongoing objection to the depositions that we've been crossed noticed two in this case, believe that Mallinckrodt has not appropriately followed the guidelines set down by the mdl court for the cross noticing of us and these depositions for the providing of documents and ensuring that we have sufficient information to go forward to question these Witnesses about Tennessee issues for depositions where we have been cross noticed I'm sure Council will want to say something back because he always does but, those are objections just for the record we disagree with these characterizations and I've only heard earlier today that state Council stated that she had not reviewed the mdl order and is in fact is intending to take a second 30 B 6 deposition of the company which violates the the principle underlying the Court's orders and with that we reserve overwrites accordingly and I just want to be very clear I didn't say I had reviewed the mdl, order I said I wasn't subject to the 14 hours our state case is not part of the mdl run our own jurisdiction as you are aware we will deal with that in the state court issue but we fully intend to take our own 30 B 6 just to be clear, I concur in Trisha's General objection that anytime she takes today should not be counted against the 14 hours that we have been provided for pursuant to the clear terms of the mdl and as noted by Trisha we were not given notice until 2:00 today that Mal crowd was taking this position, okay moving on I think we all have flights to make mr. Borges Strasse did you do anything specifically to prepare for questions about Tennessee for your deposition today no I did not in Kate did you discuss with anybody any particular issues about male and crowds business in Tennessee in preparation for your deposition today I discussed with my attorneys as part of preparation the general concept of the issue relative to Tennessee, you okay and so you have been prepared to answer questions about Tennessee for your testimony today, I have been generally prepared to answer some questions about Tennessee okay and what is your understanding of the state litigation in Tennessee, very minimal I know that it has something to do with drug trafficking laws and that's about the extent of it okay and do you have any idea who the plaintiffs are in the case not specifically no what about generally I don't know whether it's the state itself or if there are others okay and what about drug trafficking laws do you understand the lawsuit to be about the eye, really don't just know that it's that's generally what it's related to okay and other than your attorneys did you speak with anybody else about any drug trafficking issues as you said or mail and Kratts businesses in Tennessee before your deposition today no okay did you review the complaint or any other documents from the Tennessee litigation before testifying today no have you seen any portion of it, no okay has anybody summarized it for you know okay, okay I'm, earlier today you were talking about procedures related to compensation it's topic 10 which have been identified for folks that had oversight or control over Marketing sales distribution of prescription opioids for the cake the case track 1 jurisdictions do you remember that General testimony from this morning yes okay and does that compensation scheme is that different at all for Tennessee, the compensation practices excuse me that we used for our branded sales representatives were individualized the territories were individualized based upon sales representative but the overall Compensation Plan and the way it was built was consistent throughout the country okay in what sales region was Tennessee, I don't know specifically how that region was designated okay do you know anything about it changing over time I don't know specifics about a changing over time I'm aware that the sales territories were re-evaluated on a periodic annual basis have you ever heard somebody refer to a sales territory called the Nashville district, no I don't think so okay who is responsible for dividing up the various districts the sales districting plan was assembled analyzed by the commercial analytics team and was subsequently approved by Sales Management okay and I'm going to hand you what we're going to Mark as exhibit one a 17,take a look at nothing tired I can't let Sara take your time, okay okay so I have a just a couple questions I want to make sure I understand how you guys break things down so within mail and crowd and your Salesforce you have what is it regions and then districts and then territories all kind of getting smaller as they go along is that right yes that's generally correct okay and so when you look at the second slide here and what it is I've shown you which appears to be the Salesforce alignment and placement for mnk 795 launch, snap reports for North Central region deeded October 24 2013 did I read that correctly yes you did okay what is mnk 795 M NK 7 95 was the research program identifier for the product which became zart M SX R upon approval okay, and was the map reports for the for the various sales forces were those different for how do you say it 02 - is Artemis or 10 minutes then they were from Alan Kratz other branded products or were they generally the same so I can't say for sure how these differ from past district and territory alignments but we re-evaluated, added the entire sales plan for the launch of Tsar Thomas and as a result of that we drew specific territories based upon our analysis of prescribers okay were you personally involved in that and that process I was not okay and which team would have been involved in that this was formerly known as the global business insights and forecasting team also referred to as commercial analytics which was a part of, branded business group at that time okay and what's it called now that group no longer so that's one that no longer exist okay okay and so at least in 2013 these were the Region's the districts and the territories for at least a certain section of the country that's what we're looking at here right yes that's correct okay and so do you see if it says region north central and the second slide on the first page yes do you see the state of Tennessee included in that I do so would it appear from this document then that the state of Tennessee was included, in the north central region yes I agree okay now if you'll flip to the second page with me and I actually I should clarify yes sir it looks like most of Tennessee is in North Central region I don't know if the rest of Tennessee was included elsewhere well there's actually a very very astute point it looks like Memphis is not so that's a that's a very good point and I take it flipping to the second page it says District Nashville Tennessee do you see where I'm looking at mhm the very first time the very first light and so going from, you probably don't know where Jackson Tennessee is due, it's not on the mound submit to you the Jacksons about halfway between Nashville and Memphis so I'm going to kind of draw this line where that end of the blue is there and call it Jackson it's going from most of Tennessee over to the east does it look like most of Tennessee there is included within the district called Nashville Tennessee yes it appears so okay and then the various territories are included within that if you keep flipping with me you've got a couple territories there in North Carolina if you flip to the next page which is Page 4 of this exhibit there is also, a territory for Knoxville Tennessee territory for Nashville Tennessee territory for Chattanooga Tennessee territory for Johnson City Tennessee keep flipping and then you've got North and South Nashville Tennessee do you see all those yes I do okay and those are all designated a separate territories within the Nashville district is that correct yes that's correct okay and did you have anything to do with those designations no I did not okay and how many sales people would cover each territory, it's my understanding that each territory would have one sales represent okay and would they sometimes have more than one territory or did you generally do one pretory my general understanding is it's one per territory okay, and did you have anything to do with receiving information from those sales people from those territories with in Tennessee no I did not personally okay did you ever see people who did no I did not okay so do you have any information about any sales information that would have been coming from the various territories in Tennessee making its way up through the upper echelon of Mallinckrodt I do not have any of that information now that you know who would so that, would be contained in our financial records okay, in terms of individuals who might have that information I'm not sure any individuals who would still be with the company who would have that information can you think of any names of people who are no longer with the company who might have that information, trying to think if this is the time period when Ron Wood Klein was in charge of the sales team okay can you think of anybody else,this Hugh O'Neill was the president Pharmaceuticals at the time, anybody else, that specific names no okay, have you ever been to Tennessee I have been fencing yes querida Nashville Memphis Chattanooga okay and you just come as a visitor do you own property don't just a presenter and when's the last time you've been to Tennessee, I guess October, October this year yes okay where'd you go I drove through, okay, have you ever been to Upper East Tennessee Appalachian region I've driven through that area okay what years section 2 scope, you can answer,I guess was probably 95 or 96 okay, you ever been to Tennessee for work yes okay and when would that have been, approximately three three or four years ago to the Memphis area, okay was that the only time for work that you've come to Tennessee, thank I attended a conference there back in the 90s okay other than the conference and the time to going to Memphis those are the only two times okay and what brought you to Memphis three or four years ago for work objection to scope what topic does this relate to what 30 B 6 topic does this relate to you can answer the question, I came to Memphis to visit to customers of the generics business at that time okay, and who are the two customers McKesson was one and Excel RX, they were a hospice provider, okay, and what brought you to visit those two customers in Memphis just a general business discussion and just a relationship meeting okay who asked for the meeting them are you okay just scope, I don't recall okay and we're either of those customers folks that distributed now in Kratts opioid products, McKesson distributed are opioid products and accelerates purchased our opioid products for dispensing to their Pharmacy patients okay and we're now in crowds opioid products discussed at all during those two meetings Disco, I believe so okay what was the content of those discussions just go I don't recall the content, are you selling and those were not sales calls okay those were general relationship calls where we visited their facilities to see their operation and I'm sure in the course of that visit we saw our product in their distribution centers and discuss General comments about how our products were were either used or transported, okay Amber there it was there any discussion about diversion of Mount crowd opioids at either of those meetings objective scope diversion is outside the scope of the designated topics for this Witness, I don't recall any such discussions okay what about the abuse of Malachi opioids are opioids in general in those meetings, I don't recall anything like that is there anything else about the discussions that you do recall Chek just go not a proper 30 B 6 topic, okay answer, no I don't remember any other specifics okay and would there been paperwork associated with those meetings it's a report or email or something you write on the way back, something was probably generated not necessarily by myself there's an over there okay and if I were looking for those where would I look just go emails emails okay and you probably would have been copied on them I'd be my guest okay just go that's possible, okay so they weren't sales calls you didn't talk about diversion you didn't talk about abuse of opioids, talk about charge bags just go six question now for my recollection we talked with McKesson about their General operation about any, like any feedback that we had for them about the ordering process any feedback they had for us about how product was packaged or or shipped the visit with Excel or X was relative to seeing their operation talking to them in general about their business and goals for the future no specific, Asians were made that I can recall okay, okay anyways we talked before you said generally there were some differences based on individual sales people and paraphrasing you so tell me if I'm wrong here on their compensation but the general compensation scheme was somewhat uniform is that right so 24 so the Compensation Program was developed and a consistent manner the incentive Compensation Plan was was set up consistently across territory, he's the individual territory targets were set on the territory by territory basis and so the goals that sales representatives were measured against were territory specific the way they are compensated on those goals was consistent okay and do you know anything about the Nashville district and they are their goals being different you know any of the specifics on that I do not okay, okay and then earlier you talked about 850 twos or 867 sales plans do you remember those conversations we discussed a 52 and 867 data data okay did you have any companies that had 52 or 867 arrangements with Mallinckrodt in Tennessee, I am not aware if we had any customers in Tennessee who had those arrangements K where could I look to find that information, the the information about which customers provided us with those data feeds would be contained within the the distribution agreements with those customers okay and how can I find out which distribution agreements were in Tennessee with you all I'm assuming there's a bazillion of them so are they sorted in a way or the end of database how do they know within like a state territory, well so the distribution agreements weren't set up on a state territory basis and those agreements were all national level agreements okay so you would have to know who the entities are with in Tennessee that you were looking for and then find the associated agreement okay could you look from could you do it from the back end and search and see what information was being provided from Tennessee and then undo it, away, I don't know if the EDI data streams provide that kind of location information okay who would know that, trying to think of specific names, others within our company who handle those data streams would be in the IT department, but I don't know who this actual individuals are okay somebody in the IT department, yes okay great, was there any difference regarding the chargeback programs or incentive or rebate programs or their contractual agreements between the jurisdictions that you discussed earlier and Tennessee it was everything kind of the same to form all of our chargeback agreements and customer agreements were set up for the full Corporation so the if the company was a national company the agreement applied consistently across the country okay and what about if it was, a national company say it was a regional company or a smaller company was there a kind of a standard agreement for that or how would that work all of these agreements were negotiated agreements most often were written on the distribution customers paper and so they started the process and we're in there the format that they chose we negotiated terms as part of establishment of the relationship and to the extent that these would be, General customers any of those Regional distributor entities are reasonable Pharmacy chains the agreement would apply consistently throughout their entire region business okay and if I wanted to find out who specifically was getting chargebacks in Tennessee how would I find that out,again we would have to look at the chargeback transactions and find any of those that were Tennessee landed in Tennessee okay and who would I ask for that with a bi t or chargeback Department who would that be, that would be handled in our rebates processing team, okay and then earlier you were talking about the various types of information you got the reports that the IMs data on the various other reports that you could receive did you ever receive you meaning Mallinckrodt ever receive data at a Statewide level broken down by state, in the past we did receive IMS data which were broken down at a state level for certain data sets prescription data specifically, okay when you say in the past when was that so During the period of time that we marketed branded opioid products, generally between about 2008 2009 and 2015 or 16 at that time we did purchase what IMS refers to as sub National Data so, either in the exponent data which gave physician level information or in the sub-national data sets both of those data sets could be aggregated by state okay and when you say it was broken down by prescription data sets what does that mean generally I am s provides two different data feeds which we purchase one is sales information relative to unit volumes and that's universe, volumes being purchased by pharmacies and then they also provide prescription information which is a collection of information and projection of total Market relative to prescriptions dispensed from pharmacies to patients okay and who would have been responsible for reviewing that state level information, that state level information was reviewed by the commercial analytics team or also called Global business insights and forecasting that team would have had access to state level data and as necessary they would have looked at entire State data more often they aggregated by territory and region, okay so I'm going to try to put this in a little bit more understandable terms so that IMS data would show you from Tennessee I want to make sure I'm understanding you because I don't do the pharmacy thing on would show you say oxygen Eric oxycodone how much of that was going to an individual Pharmacy I must I must prescription data will show the number of prescriptions filled, old for a given product and state was part of the identifiers included so it would show how many prescriptions were filled for Oxycodone for the state of Tennessee that would be one data point you could analyze okay could you also do it by county, so in the exponent data set from IMS we had zip code level information I don't know if County was represented or if you'd have to aggregate but during those years I just want to make sure I understand it so during those years when you all were getting that IMS data 2008-2009 to roughly 2015 you would get for example how much Oxycodone was being prescribed and or, or filled by ZIP code, hi I'm not certain if we got that level of data for prescribed okay there's there's there are two different views to the prescription data that I am as provides they do provide some view to prescribe quantities K and then they do provide A View to dispensed quantities the Gap in the middle there's anything that just, don't get filled at the pharmacy okay and I know that they dispense data we received at a detailed zip code level I don't know if we received the prescription was written data at that level okay and who would do that, that would probably at this point be a matter of digging into the data and trying to find what's in there okay and so responsible for that for looking at that data and kind of ingesting it would have been the commercial analytics team is that right that's correct okay and do you know if the commercial analytics team would communicate any of that information to the, sales team or two suspicious order monitoring team, I know that commercial analytics summarized results by territory and provided those results to the sales team so that they could evaluate performance okay what about communicating those numbers to the suspicious order monitoring folks just go I am not aware if they did or not who would know that, the people involved in suspicious order monitoring, do you know how long Mallinckrodt retains that data, interactive Forum how long we retain what the IMs data that you received many of the data sets including the ZIP code level exponent data were our data feed was lost when we into the contract we do, do have some archived exponent data I don't know I can't personally speak to how complete that data is for the entire period of time we sold these products and you know who would now where that information is so the data that we did have the exponent data that we did have has been produced in the mdl I volunteer lawyers yes okay, and how do you know it's been produced I was told it's been okay you were you involved in producing it personally not personally involved now okay we're people that report to you involved in producing it I helped identify that it may still exist and told people where to look okay great, okay fantastic and then earlier on you were talking about, strike that hold on for just one second, okay earlier on you were talking about different databases and reports that that Mallinckrodt consults in connection with the sale marketing or distribution of its opioid products and when you talked about all of those were there any specific reports other than the IMs data that we just talked about that would have had to do a Tennessee, outside of IMS data I'm not aware of any Tennessee specific reports okay what about any reports that were created or that you ever saw that would have to do with maybe the Appalachian region of Tennessee or the Appalachian region of the country I'm not aware of any specific reports that nature okay what about Regional reports maybe the u.s. South did you ever see any Regional reports about opioid use or sales or, getting of opioids in the south of the United States no okay, okay and when you were talking about your marketing expenditures earlier those broken down by region at all know our marketing expenditures for Branded products were at most broken down by the product but not detailed at a regional level okay which reminds me I'm I had a question from earlier that I meant to follow up on when you talk about branded opioid products you talked about and I'm going to totally mispronounces, it was the exert to miss its Artemis start a canvass their tennis you say it differently than I do and I'm sure you're correct and I've just read it too much okay and then he's all go correct in my saying that one is okay and then you talked a little bit about Roxy codone being a branded opioid is that right Roxy codone itself is technically a branded product okay it is classified as a brand, by FDA has that brand name on the label Mallinckrodt owns the asset owns the rights to that product and we do still manufacture and sell that product in very small quantities we have never promoted or marketed that product okay and then there's also a generic of that Roxy code own action asked and answered duplicative go ahead Mallinckrodt and, about 12 other companies make it generic direct okay so now we've talked about star 10s, priced on messed it up exha go rocks ecotone where there are other branded opioid products that Mallinckrodt had an answer, at one point in time we did also sell Magna set okay yeah, and we did so a product that contained an opioid but was not a pain product and that Stussy caps okay we talked about those before other than that anything else those are kind of the person the only ones okay great, okay and do you know,if the marketing results for your branded products are broken down by region at all, the term marketing results go ahead our sales results would have been broken down by sales territory and by region and that would have been in terms of prescriptions of our products okay so you when you were talking before about kind of tracking your return on investment want to make sure I understood that as well I'm so I want to get back at way up we're going to go real basic so now I've got General, he is going to spend some money on marketing its products and trying to Target people in order to get them to prescribe their products right we generally had a marketing budget for a branded products in order to support our selling efforts okay and then you can tell if those marketing efforts have been successful or Not by how many prescriptions are written for your product in a particular territory is that right, in terms of analyzing specific marketing efforts it's really difficult to determine when an individual marketing a marketing effort has been successful in general when we set our plans and our marketing budgets we looked at our overall expectations for the amount of activity that our sales team was going to make in a given year and the the, Nations around market share or growth in market share for our products when doing that we determined what a reasonable marketing budget would be based on the efforts that we thought were needed and what those efforts cost is any of that broken down by region or state no okay so everything is just kind of nationally this is what we're doing you're not doing a different marketing plan for a region for example, no over efforts were National okay, you said before that you're aware of the opioid crisis are you we're specifically about the opioid crisis in Tennessee, I am not aware of specific details about the situation Tennessee okay have you ever heard of something called neonatal abstinence syndrome checked into scope I believe I have seen the term okay and what do you understand it to me I believe it is a situation involving neonates born to mothers who, had been taking opioids prior to delivery and those neonates then being free of the opioid being free of the opioid that not not receiving the opioid anymore I've you want to say it okay you're saying it in a very scientific way if you say it in another way is it babies that are born dependent on opioids to your understanding, to my understanding that's the the resulting condition when a baby is born dependent upon a okay and do you know where Tennessee ranks in the number of babies that are born with neonatal abstinence syndrome no I don't okay when is the first time you think you've heard about new natal abstinence syndrome,the first time I heard the term I believe was when, reading the label for Exotica okay, have you ever been involved in any meetings or any discussions about neonatal abstinence syndrome and any amount Kratts products no I'm not okay what about for opioids in general no I'm not okay, have you ever heard of the acronym hit da H I'm sorry a hidta, no I don't think so have you ever heard of something called the Appalachian high intensity drug trafficking area, sections of scope, yeah I don't think so okay, do you know of anyone at Mallinckrodt was looking at rates of Naas in East Tennessee, I'm not aware if anyone was looking at that okay and who if I were to try to figure out who would have been do you know which department that would have fallen under, so Market surveillance of Adverse Events would have been there's possibility of pharmacovigilance okay, and would that same Department have also been monitoring opioid related deaths that same Department would have monitored reports of deaths or other Adverse Events related to specifically our products, when you say specifically our products what do you mean, relating specifically to reports involving specific Mallinckrodt products as opposed to General opioid reports so if it was actually codone if they didn't know it was Mallinckrodt you wouldn't necessarily have been monitoring that but if it's Mallinckrodt opioid then that's something that would have been monitored it's by General understanding that the pharmacovigilance process is didn't capture information on unidentified, products of that nature okay do you know how products are identified or somebody dies which product I don't know the details of how that would be identified sure it would be different depending on the case, Okay earlier we were talking about the process used to determine which medical professionals your sales representatives would individually contact with respect to your opioid products remember that conversation from earlier today yes do you know who the sales reps targeted in Tennessee, I don't know specifically they targeted no Kate do you know who would, I don't believe there's anyone at the company Who would know those specifics and I don't know if there were if they're still documents that would have it okay why would there not be documents about that anymore I'm just not aware of those documents okay and why would nobody from the company know anymore there are very few people still with our company who sold these products in the past okay and those, our with the company were not directly involved with that level of detail okay and when did you I'm sorry I think you'd said that before was it 2015 that that program stopped generally 2015 our marketing efforts around branded opioids ceased okay and that would be your specific sales targeting of doctors for sales terms of doctors for sales, creation of marketing materials and marketing plans okay so you don't know if anyone was flagged for removal from a sales Target list for Mallinckrodt in Tennessee I don't know specific to Tennessee you know okay do you know where I could find that information officer answered the scene, you would have to find the old sales plans and I don't know where those are kept, somebody in the sales department would know sales department doesn't exist anymore so it would probably be captured in emails and other collected correspondence okay to your knowledge there weren't any documents that were destroyed by mail and cried about sales to my knowledge no okay you so you didn't see anything that was like okay sales departments going away let's get rid of all the documents, I didn't hear anything like that no okay so hypothetically the document should still exist just probably in a different spot, hypothetically okay okay, did Mallinckrodt distribute opioids to online retailers, objective scope there's a specific topic about online pharmacies that's designated for different Witness, okay but I think it's also encompassed and number 27 so did Mallinckrodt distribute opioids online retailers objective scope 27 read to the extent not Encompass with other topics and there's a specific topic about online can you can answer the question same objection I am not aware of ever selling opioids to online retailers okay, you ever heard of a person named Abu abdulrahman Muhammad, no I don't think so the prescriber in Tennessee no okay what about Timothy gelder, no I don't think so okay so you haven't been involved in any discussions about mr. Mohammed or mr. gowda know okay what about Gary Arlen more, I don't believe so okay have you ever heard of a doctor name's David Florence, no he also had a very brief reality show called dockstar heard of dockstar section 2 scope no I've never heard of that okay what about Marc Murphy, Ed White, I know I person named Ed White I don't know if it's the same person does the Ed White that you know live in Tennessee I don't believe so okay does he operate a medical clinic of some sort no he's not different guy okay what about Pam light, okay do you ever hear any discussions about any particular medical clinics or doctors offices with in Tennessee during your time at Mallinckrodt, no, okay, were you involved at all in the DEA investigation of Sunrise Wholesale in Delray Beach Florida injection is help, the matters are specifically designated another topic is designated for another witness okay now I was not involved,do you know what Mallinckrodt share was of the opioid Market in Tennessee, no I do not I'm going to give you some different times from 2005 to 2010 did you know what the market share was a male guard opioids in Tennessee no we never analyzed share of opioid market and by state at all okay and what about from 2010 to the present no I do not know okay,have you ever heard of Tennessee being referred to as ground zero for the opioid crisis, no I don't think so okay what about West Virginia, to school, I don't know if I've heard the specific term Ground Zero but I have heard about West Virginia okay have you heard generally about Appalachia kind of West Virginia Kentucky the mountain region being particularly hard hit by opioid abuse issues I'm personally aware from the news media about the opioid issues in the Appalachia region okay and where do you think you first became aware of that, I don't remember specifically, if I had to guess it would be somewhere around maybe 2010 okay do you know how you became aware of it, the press and the news media okay not through your official duties at Mount cross no okay if you ever heard of something called the oxy Express affection to scope, now okay you heard about I-75 being a drug trafficking corridor from Florida to Ohio actions go this is getting into diversion issues that are designated for different witness also has to do with abuse, I don't know if I've heard specifically about I-75 okay have you heard generally about there being some Highway some taking pills from Florida North I've heard generally about pattern of involvement with Florida okay and where did you hear that, again generally in the news media okay but not through your official involvement at Mallinckrodt, not that I can recall okay so based on this information that you had from Appalachia being particularly hard hit by the opioid abuse epidemic and this kind of movement of pills going from some Florida up north where is there any differential or different way that the Appalachian State's were treated At All by Mallinckrodt in any of the topics we've discussed today, so when we on in the generics business when we contract with our wholesale and distributor customers or with Pharmacy chains we contract with them based upon their entire scope of operation whether that's Nationwide or Regional and we have processes in place that allow us to, to work with them to ensure that both sides are complying with the regulations involved with shipment of the products that we sell them if there are specific issues with an individual Distribution Center or Pharmacy chain or other type of customer we have processes in place to, to address that, it's a very long answer about very specific things but my question is was there any sort of a regional change that was made like hey guys you know we got this issue going on in Appalachia so we're going to watch our customers customers to see what's going on who they're shipping to or we're going to put out an alert to all of our customers that they need to watch their customers customers you know to see what's going on and the Appalachian region was there any differential and in that regard rejection of the form of the question, kitchen beyond the scope of the topics for this Witness, I am not aware of anything like that that occurred and and have not prepared speak to that okay so the topics you did speak on today though having to do with abuse having to do with sales having to do with compensation having to a chargeback information all the topics that you've talked about I just want to be clear that there wasn't any differential that was for the Appalachian region or for Tennessee actually the former question, any of the programs that you mentioned relative to targeting and incentivizing the Branded sales team or administering contracts with our distribution Partners more all established at a national level consistent with our overall plans or business processes okay so to piggyback off of that and so nothing was nobody was treated differently if they were in Appalachia, Tennessee you treated all states to say, our decisions were made for individual, distributors or prescribers based upon the activity at that particular customer or prescriber and it was not catered to a certain region but more to the specific activity sometimes I'm going to repeat my question one more time so I can be really clear about it I just want to know for sales or for compensation or incentives or any of those things that you've talked about understanding, sometimes things are treated differently based on individual circumstances but from a regional or a state level everything was the same nobody was treated differently in Appalachia or Tennessee is they were Countrywide attraction to form, it's just a yes or no I I still will go back to my same answer that the plans we put in place we're consistent on a nationwide basis and consistent across our business if there were individual Healthcare practitioners or individual distributors or wholesalers purchasing product from us that, did not abide by the agreements that were in place we took action on that specific incident we did not take action on a regional basis based upon other information okay or on a Statewide basis based on other information or in a Statewide basis that's correct okay if we can just stop the rocket for a minute",0.8503318973821983,0.47952542,0.9128387
ghfk0146,"coming up next the guest on our first viewer call in program this evening we'll talk about a recent government report on the effects of smoking the director of the office on smoking and health at the Center for Disease Control dr. Ronald Davis will take your questions and comments about government efforts to combat smoking and the diseases associated with smoking, dr. Ronald Davis director of the u.s. office on smoking and health and whose office prepared the report that was released on Tuesday called smoking and health and National status report what is the status of smoking and health in this country today well the status is a gremlin in terms of deaths caused by smoking we estimate that 390,000, kids are dying every year from diseases caused by smoking which include lung cancer emphysema other cancers heart disease and a variety of other diseases that are caused by smoking so there's a tremendous health impact of smoking and the 390,000 deaths that's the equivalent of 1,000 Americans dying every day from this deadly Behavior but what this report focused on was the economic impact of smoking and not only is there a huge health impact but a huge economic, comic impact as well and we estimated in this report that smoking was responsible for fifty two billion dollars economic impact in the United States about half of which is health care costs from the treatment of smoking-related diseases but about half of which is also for lost productivity people dying prematurely and their productivity lost from our society or people disabled or people losing extra days from work because of smoking related symptoms and disease, isn't that fifty two billion dollar figure which is enormous that is the equivalent of two hundred and twenty dollars for every person in this Society so we're all paying for the diseases that smoking causes whether we smoke or not secretary Sullivan presented the report to Congress on Tuesday what's been the reaction so far well I think that there's been a favorable reaction to the report people are most impressed with these economic figures, as we all know I think about the health effects of smoking but people don't realize that they're paying a hidden taxes he called it for smoking higher taxes higher health insurance premiums even if you don't smoke you're paying these things and in One Way Or Another We're All paying for this deadly destructive addicting behavior in his presentation secretary Louis Sullivan also predicted that a goal would be smoke free Society in 10 years by the year 2000 how realistic do you think that is it depends on, how you define it when former Surgeon General C Everett Koop announced his goal for smoke free Society by the year 2000 which announced in 1984 he didn't really mean that we would have 0 smokers by the year 2000 that is not going to happen we will still probably be left with at least a group of Hardcore smokers who don't give it up no matter what we say but what he did in Vision was a society by the year 2000 in which it would be smoke-free for the vast majority, authority of people who choose not to smoke in other words smokers would only be smoking in the privacy of their own homes so that non-smokers would not be forced to take in this toxic gas that is being released by the cigarettes of smokers our phone lines are open the subject is specifically the smoking and health a national status report issued to a release to Congress and the public on Tuesday we have its principal author at least the man who directed the work behind this report our phone lines, is our phone numbers are on the screen for you to use you can begin dialing now as you address your comments or questions to dr. Ronald Davis director of the u.s. office on smoking and health a couple things right off the bat do you smoke no I don't have you ever smoked no more than a few cigarettes experimenting like probably all teenagers do this report is 390 pages long is this the totality of the reporters or some compendium of other related data that it, it is comes along with it that's the report it's the second edition we're actually required by Congress to produce a national status report on smoking every two years and this is the second such report that we've produced our office is also responsible for producing the annual surgeon general's report on the health consequences of smoking so we're coming out with one or two reports to Congress on smoking every year why don't you talk briefly about the breadth of what's in this book this report basically looks at what's happened in the last few years with, expect to smoking in terms of the number of deaths that are caused by smoking in terms of the economic impact of smoking as I mentioned already and what this report provides is a state-by-state analysis of deaths and the economic costs from smoking and what it reveals is that not only do we have this huge impact at the national level but there's a tremendous variation in the health and economic impact of smoking from one state to another for example in terms of economic costs the economic cost of smoking very, from a high of about two hundred and eighty four dollars per person in Rhode Island to 56 dollars per person in Utah Utah has the lowest smoking rate in the country only about 15 percent of adults in Utah smoke so one value in this report is that we now have specific information on what's happening at the state level it also reviews what's happening legislatively and it shows that as you might expect that more and more legislation is restricting smoking and, public places and in the workplace and there's also a section on State and local programs on smoking to help people who smoke quit and to prevent teenagers from taking up this behavior and what we've seen over the last couple of years is that there's a growing number of programs available to help people quit so that smokers if they feel that they would need some assistance including they shouldn't despair more than likely there are programs in their own Community to help them quit how would somebody get a copy of the report, they could get a copy by writing our office which is office on smoking and health and that's 5600 Fisher's Lane Rockville Maryland 2008 57 I and what do you say in the report about tobacco other than cigarettes we do have the results of a survey we conducted a 1986 a national survey of adults on all variety of uses of tobacco including cigars and pipes and smoke, Alice tobacco that is chewing that is chewing tobacco and snuff and what we've seen is that cigar and pipe smoking have gone down dramatically in the last 20 years or so but with respect to chewing tobacco and snuff we've seen the trends going in the opposite direction and we've seen a tremendous increase in the use of snuff and chewing tobacco particularly in young boys who more often than not are emulating the professional athletes in particular professional baseball players who are using these products on the baseball, fields and shown of course on national television and that's a big problem those products cause mouth cancer and that can be fatal dr. Davis let's take the first call this one from Facts Lake Illinois go ahead please you're on the air, yes you were talking about the economic impact people that smoke what about all the people that smoke and drink what is the economic impact of people quit smoking, well then quit drinking, the economic impact of alcohol use and abuse is also very high and in fact there are social costs and economic costs from alcoholism that we're all well aware one particular problem with with alcohol and smoking is that they interact actually to tremendously increase some of the health risks that users will face for example if somebody smokes and drinks alcohol excessively they have a tremendously, increased risk of getting cancer of the mouth or cancer of the larynx the voice box so there are also very high social and economic cost from alcoholism and for the person who uses and abuses alcohol as well as smoke cigarettes there's a very high cost what is your professional specialty I specialize in preventive medicine and our guest has also received a ba from the University of Michigan and 1978 he also has training at the University of, Chicago master of arts public policy studies and he's originally from Chicago Illinois and the next call for him is from New York City go ahead please you're on the air thank you dr. Davis what can we do to ask government to stop subsidizing the tobacco Farmers all right thank you why certainly would understand the concern that you have and that other people have where you have two arms of government apparently acting inconsistently and the, is that that our mission is Health while the mission of the US Department of Agriculture which administers the tobacco subsidy program has a different Mission and that is to help the u.s. farmer and the answer that I would give to your question is that the concerns you have you should express your congressman, given that dichotomy is it possible to say that there is a an official position of the federal government on smoking, there are many official positions of the US government on smoking and they're not always totally in concert and we just have to concentrate on our own mission and our mission is to promote good health to prevent disease and enhance the quality of life and that's what we do and by we you mean your department that's right so it would be incorrect to say that the federal government has adopted by receiving this report any single position on smoking, well we do have very clear and definite positions on smoking and health it just so happens that the US Department of Agriculture sets policy related to Tobacco farming and growing and agriculture we have another part of the federal government that has to do with trade policies on Tobacco and there are many other examples that I could give you where other parts of the federal government are more focused on one aspect of tobacco, whereas the area of tobacco that we're most interested in is preventing its use and preventing smoking-related disease all right Pueblo Colorado is next go ahead yes I was wondering like on asbestos where they see that causes lung disease or this Rocky Mountain Arsenal weather everything shows that it's always on account of smoking yet they tear down a lot of buildings on a kind of asbestos that rock, about North Fulton are people all the time because it causes cancer is there any kind of study I could get his to break down whether everything is caused by smoking when you here in the paper all the time that there's a lot of other things that cause lung cancer besides smoking thank you there are many causes of lung cancer but cigarette smoking is at the top of the list and we estimate that cigarette smoking accounts for about 85 to 90 percent of all deaths, from lung cancer in our society now asbestos does cause some cases of lung cancer of course especially for those who have worked in an environment where they've been exposed to asbestos for a number of years and again like the case of alcohol and smoking here's another example where if you smoke and are exposed to asbestos your risk of getting lung cancer has tremendously increased if you only smoke but aren't exposed to asbestos you have about a five-fold increase, risk of getting lung cancer if you're exposed to asbestos but but don't smoke you also have about a five fold increased risk but if you have both of those exposures you have about a 50 fold increased risk of lung cancer so again you have to be particularly careful not to have any risk factors but especially not to have a combination of risk factors we've got half an hour to go with dr. Ronald Davis the subject is smoking and health and the next call is from Westville Illinois go ahead, yes I'd like to know why our government with this being such a dangerous drug, as allowing this to go on and fighting marijuana and Other Drugs that have a less of a death rate, well there are of course many problems associated with illegal drug use and I don't need to tell anybody about those it's very clear that we have a lot of violence we have organized crime involvement we have a lot of social problems that come out of the use of illegal drugs but you do make an important point that if you look solely at the number of people who die from illegal drugs that number is actually dwarfed by the people who died, die from the legal addicting drugs in our society and those are tobacco and alcohol primarily and as I said we have almost 400,000 Americans dying every year from cigarette smoking that's more than one out of every six deaths in this country alcohol and alcohol abuse claim another 100,000 or so if you look at the number of people who die from cocaine and heroin and marijuana you're on the you're talking about somewhere around, Americans who are dying from the use of those drugs that's not to minimize the social impact of those drugs which is tremendous but in terms of deaths tobacco and alcohol are at the top of the list dr. Davis quickly before the next call does this report contain recommendations the report does contain some recommendations and the Secretary of Health and Human Services dr. Sullivan made several recommendations when he released this report and when he testified before Congress he's calling for all sectors of society really to, do more to oppose smoking in our societies calling for smoke-free environments wherever people mingle he's calling on the private sector to do more for example he's already why don't we get to some of those recommendations after this next all and this is from Jacksonville Florida go ahead I'm I'm calling in regard to addiction according to dr. Koop, nicotine addiction is as strong as heroin cocaine alcohol all of those addictions including bulimia you can name almost any kind of addiction there are Clinic to help people overcome these addictions clinics full-time clinics the people can go to and get real help, I think cigarette nicotine addiction gets the short end of the stick we get really very little help the American Cancer Society has a little weekly meeting a pat on the head and you go home and do it all by yourself I've been smoking longer than either two of you have been alive I would like to quit smoking but I need some help and I think if I could find a clinic like alcoholics can like bulimic span like obese people can I might, stand a chance of getting off cigarettes but I cannot do it alone with one little stinking meeting a week and I think even spent all those millions that you're spending on other things on really helping people we might get somewhere with wiping out nicotine addiction well we want to do all we can to help smokers like yourself quit and you hit the nail on the head by pointing out that nicotine can be as addicting as as heroin and cocaine as Surgeon General former Surgeon General Coupe said when he released, report on that subject in 1988 about eighty percent of smokers say they'd like to quit and most of them have been unable to quit despite repeated attempts to quit and so that certainly goes against the tobacco industry's argument that this is just a matter of free choice their best clients would like to give it up but are controlled by this strong nicotine addiction what I would suggest is that if you're someone who feels that you need help I would first of all call your local Cancer Society or longer associated, ation or Heart Association and see what materials they may have available for you there are many self-help materials where you can walk yourself through your own quit smoking kit for example and that's what they provide to you or they may have quit smoking programs that they will provide either at low cost or for free if you have a real strong physical addiction and for example if you smoke more than a pack a day if you light up that first cigarette within 30 minutes after Awakening if you smoke when you're sick, or where it's forbidden those are all clues that you have a strong physical addiction then you may benefit from a prescription prescription for nicotine chewing gum which you can obtain through a prescription from your physician so I would see your physician if you fit into some of those categories why do you need a prescription for nicotine chewing gum the nicotine gum is is a drug and it's licensed by the Food and Drug Administration and it's it's only licensed for sale by having a physician's prescription, option is that contradictory that you can buy a cigarette without prescription but you need prescription for nicotine gum many people would argue that and some people have argued that that tobacco itself ought to be regulated say by the Food and Drug Administration or some other Federal agency because it contains this addicting drug nicotine that is carefully controlled when it's in gum Daly City California go ahead hi I was just hoping maybe you could give me some advice, ice on how I could possibly get my mother to quit smoking I mean maybe I couldn't get her to do both but to quit smoking and drinking she's been she's 47 almost 48 and she does it every single day and she does it all the time and she expressed a desire to quit well I remember her quitting once when I was a teenager and it didn't last very long she had gained weight she was upset by that but, she hasn't really she pretty much is in with the attitude that well my beer and cigarettes are all I have and and I just wish you wouldn't do it mostly for her health but also because I do not like cigarettes and you know and I drink maybe once or twice a year I just wish you'd quit it mostly for her health I'm very concerned about her alright thank you Bruce just made the important point that you first have to have motivation to quit and if you don't have that motivation nobody's going to quit, it but it's difficult to give you a general answer because what we've seen is that Smokers smoke for a variety of different reasons so I'm have a strong psychological addiction some have a strong physical addiction and most smokers probably fall somewhere in the middle and if they have a strong physical addiction they may benefit from nicotine chewing gum if they don't perhaps they need more counseling and behavioral treatment but I think the main point that needs to be made is that you need your mother needs one on one, whistling I think to find out why she smokes and then the therapy can be personalized to her actually about ninety percent of smokers who quit quit on their own so many people feel that it's just a matter of willpower they make a decision to quit and then they quit but the remaining 10% need help and they should be able to get help and some will choose self-help materials others will want to have counseling others may even want to be hospitalized and there are few programs that even hospitalized people were nicotine detoxification just like, like those who were hospitalized for alcohol detox before we get through with this segment I want to squeeze in some of these recommendations that secretary Sullivan made that are not contained in this report and you were ready to go through that list why don't you continue that one thing that secretary Sullivan has already recommended he's recommended directly to the convenience stores he's written to the association that represents all the large convenience store chains in this country to enforce the laws that exist in 44 states that prohibit the sale of tobacco, miners I think we could prevent a lot of kids from taking up tobacco if we simply made it more difficult for them to get tobacco and 44 states have these laws on the books but they're not enforced at all and of course how can you enforce them when you have vending machines practically on every corner that allow kids to buy of course without any verification of age the other thing he's done is he's in the process of writing all the hospital seven thousand hospitals across the country that participate in the Medicare program urging them to go smoke-free to, I'd a Clean Indoor Air environment for the staff for the patients and the visitors at these hospitals he's going to be launching a campaign that focuses in on smoking among minorities and women and in youth the populations that are often smoking at higher rates than the overall population Huntsville Alabama go ahead, hello how are you doing fine think I'm interested in knowing if you really believe you can do an honest study of the cost for instance how do you prove that cigarettes doesn't make don't make some people more productive if somebody dies it just about retirement age that's Optimum they don't draw money later, it's a very complicated question anxiety levels have very serious effects on your productivity it may be that they continue smoking you're good for some people things out in levels Holly do you believe that or emphatically I believe it are you a smart don't know how to measure it yesterday spoke of course I'd like to quit too but it's not an unmitigated awful thing as some of these studies, Trend in Lee make it out to be how long have you smoked 25 years how much do you smoke three packs the anything else, I mean you have anything else you want to say I don't I was very interested in hearing him react to that all right cause it's pretty hard for me to believe you can honestly assess the about the economic impact of such a thing all right thank you we can't measure all of the effects of smoking but we can at least measure several objective facts about smoking you're right some smokers feel that their stress is relieved by smoking and they think that they are more productive when allowed to smoke on the, hand the vast majority of people in our society are non-smokers and most of them are bothered by passive smoking by exposure to other people smoke and they feel that their productivity is worsened by having to breathe other people smoke also smokers spend several minutes out of everyday lighting up a cigarette and taking smoking breaks and while that might not be a big expense for the individual you multiply it across the whole population of 50 million smokers in the United States, it's and that adds up but the objective facts are that smokers are more likely much more likely to die prematurely they're much more likely to lose days from work because of illnesses caused by smoking and yeah those things up and that's how we come up with a fairly conservative estimate of fifty two billion dollars for direct health care costs and lost productivity due to smoking related diseases the collar raises an interesting point though do you see as a medical person and one whose integral to this report any, positive aspects of smoking, I actually think that tobacco has no redeeming qualities and people often bring up well if we regulate tobacco and this way what's going to follow for example if we restrict tobacco advertising are we then going to restrict advertising for alcohol or automobiles don't cars kill people or red meat doesn't that kill people and my answer to them is that too in the point that dr. Sullivan made a few days ago is that tobacco is the only product that when used exactly as intended, it kills people and dr. Sullivan pointed out that it is wrong to promote a product that when used as intended kills people you can't say that about alcohol or cars or red meat those products more often than not those products do have at least some redeeming qualities certainly automobiles do certainly meet provides important nutritional quality as long as it's consumed in moderation but if these products are used as intended in moderation even alcohol it's safe but tobacco it's, it's dangerous its deadly it's costly when used as intended Scottsdale Arizona you're next yeah what I'm trying to say is not like the doctor's opinion on that that what they're doing right now it's wonderful with keeping kids and everybody for something to not to smoke and if you don't glamorize it people is not going to smoke but I disagree of having it outlawed and policed, and then you're going to go right back like broad vision and everything else on that like you say well people are going to die a lot sooner and everything that's fine let it be let these people that smoke I know people that their parents smoke and the kids don't smoke all right 22 23 years old okay so thank you we agree that prohibition is not the answer and we're not recommending it I don't think anybody is seriously recommend, being a ban on Tobacco like we had a ban on alcohol earlier this Century I think most people agree that was a failed experiment but what we are saying is that we ought to give people a fair chance and right now tobacco industry is spending 2.6 billion dollars to portray this deadly addicting product as safe sexy and sophisticated and they're preying on the most vulnerable parts of our society more than 80 percent of smokers start to smoke as kids and their barraged with these deceptive advertising, sizing messages and what we're saying is let's at least protect the kids from this slanted point of view that they're getting it's not Freedom of Choice when you're trapping young kids as early as 8 10 12 years old with deceptive advertising and then they become addicted to the product and when they're adults they're no longer able to quit that a quarter hour left to go or next Call Yonkers New York I was an Alcoholic Anonymous before idea, we were taught that any addiction or drug e has to have a mind-altering when you smoke there is no mind-altering effect on the person the way you're talking a smoking it's a habit and if someone has the habit of cleaning a house thoroughly constantly it's compulsive for them does that mean they were drugging they aren't you there are actually very, criteria that we use to define a drug as addicting and one of those is that the drug affects the chemistry of the brain and the central nervous system and there's a large body of evidence that shows that nicotine affects the brain and the central nervous system just as addicting drugs do and while you may not feel like your mood is altered people in fact do have their mood altered by nicotine and we've identified parts of the brain tissue that that are what we call, the receptors for the chemical nicotine I think we're all familiar with some smokers who when they run out of a pack of cigarettes they'll scrounge through the garbage looking for perhaps a but of cigarette with with a little bit of tobacco left on it or they'll walk six blocks through the rain to buy a pack of cigarettes because they're going through such intense Cravings there are known physiologic symptoms for nicotine withdrawal that people, variants there is a great tendency to relapse when people quit and all of these things are part and parcel to drug addictions and nicotine meets the criteria for defining a drug as addicting just as well as the other drugs that we accept as addicting such as cocaine and heroin is your office a smoke-free workplace we are as a matter of fact the whole Department of Health and Human Services is smoke free and that affects about 120,000 employees of our department Nationwide so in fact, we're probably the largest smoke-free employer in the country does that mean that when you have couriers come into the waiting room they aren't allowed to smoke that's right smoking is only allowed outside the facility I'm not particularly happy that we do see a few employees who are smoking outside our entrance doors and some butts collect on the ground outside those doors but it's still a lot better than having people smoke inside where we'd all be exposed to the tobacco smoke and how long has it been smoke-free oh for a year or two, you recall if there was much resistance to that policy at the time there was not much resistance from smokers and that's one thing that we've seen across the country that work site smoking limitations and bands are accepted very well by employees smokers and non-smokers alike more than half of smokers according to public opinion polls endorse restrictions on smoking in public places and in the worksite and that's probably because they see a smoke-free environment as an additional, all motivator to help them quit perhaps the last thing that will finally help them kick this addiction Pasadena California you're next I think that all thinking Americans believe that cigarette smoking or tobacco is a is a killer but I think that our government is is quite ambiguous and I'm going back to the subsidies that the tobacco subsidies why would not our government subsidize the, tobacco Growers or increase the tobacco Growers to go into other crops and not be planting a killer plant that's a good question I think the simple answer to that is that tobacco happens to be one of the most lucrative cash crops that a farmer could grow and it may not be profitable for a tobacco farmer to all of a sudden switch from growing tobacco to another crop and what that points out the need to do is if and when the, partment of Agriculture or the US Congress should decide to abolish this program programs would need to be in place to assist tobacco Farmers to shift their crop Land from the growing of tobacco to the growing of crops that don't kill people Muskegon Michigan you're on the air I'm a nonsmoker and my question has to do with the workplace it seems to me we've got an agency in place now that could deal with this problem by declaring, tobacco cigarette smoke the same type of poison that we find in other chemical has that been addressed you mean the FDA I'm talking about Asha OSHA okay thank you the occupational safety and health administration or OSHA has been petitioned by some consumer groups to do as you suggest and that is to declare this under some emergency standard to be an occupational workplace, Toxin and to issue an emergency standard to either ban it or severely restrict smoking in the workplace and my understanding is that OSHA is investigating this their initial decision was to not issue an emergency standard on this topic but to to go through some more careful and protracted deliberations on this issue there is now some litigation before the courts trying to pressure, this agency to take the action that they were petitioned to take from an organization here in Washington called action on smoking and health or Ash so there is a lot of discussion of this issue and it's not a new idea and it's one that I think is going to be discussed more Manchester New Hampshire hi hi I'm requesting I quit smoking a year ago and I'm around cigarette smoking a lot my friends all smoke and I go out frequently around smoke, and I was wondering what can I do to help myself, are you able to convince The Smokers have you tried to convince The Smokers to smoke somewhere else no they say smoking my house smoking in your house yeah well I would establish a firm policy that no smoking is allowed in your house certainly a place like your home or your automobile for example that you have immediate control over I think you ought to Institute a policy no smoking I think you ought to point out to them and we can give you the literature to back back this, up that people who are exposed to tobacco smoke in the home have a higher risk of lung cancer and you ought to tell the guests that you have who smoke in your home about that and the case of your workplace certainly management can Institute rules that restrict or ban smoking in the workplace car do you feel you're able to Institute that policy in your own house I think without any complications you're going to do it I want to try all right thanks thank you Federal Way Washington is next go ahead please, he's thank you dr. Arya was spoken for over 50 years and the only way I gave it up with I got a good case of the flu bug for three days and for three days I didn't want to drink or eat anything but I think we're making too much of this created I agree that there's some people can die of this and then have but we can live two gunshot wounds and cancer and smoking such as I've done I would say this total why is it, that like dr. Cooper's mentioned that the cause of AIDS is the misuse of the rectum and why have North people in quarantine at first had this disease in the we are to sexual now are having to pay the price that they're not being quarantined all right sir thank you that let me first congratulate you for quitting smoking you've probably taken the one step that will improve your health and lengthen your life than any other step you can take I'm not going to going to discuss AIDS because I'm not here to, discuss AIDS but what I will say in reference to your statement that we make too much of this I just want you to know that you're lucky that it was pneumonia or the flu that convinced you to quit smoking rather than lung cancer because lung cancer is almost always fatal we don't cure lung cancer and that's why we see so many people dying of smoking every year Miami Florida it slow you're on the earth yes mr. Davis few people few callers have touched on the subject of tobacco subsidies and, I'd like to know if you have any estimate of how much the United States government spends on Tobacco subsidies each year and also if you know when the last, vote in the US House of Representatives or in the Senate was taken on Tobacco subsidies you don't have anything having to do with faculty subsidies and also when the next vote will be taken is supposed to be taken on anything having to do with tobacco subsidies do you know my recollection is in response to your first question that the administrative costs of the program are somewhere on the order of ten to twenty million dollars a year there may be much higher costs from, the program than that because loans that were made from the government to Tobacco Farmers over the course of many years have been defaulted on or some of those loans have been paid back at interest rates that were lower than the prime rate and those costs to the government into the taxpayer can add up to hundreds of millions of dollars in response to your question about when was the last time this was voted on it's actually I think somewhat surprising to me that there haven't been any votes just on the topic of the, go subsidy in Congress in recent years to my knowledge I actually was sitting in the chamber of the US Senate back maybe about six seven years ago when they voted on this and they may have been the last time it was voted on and the tobacco price support program won by a slim vote of about 40 to 41 so when it has been voted on it's barely survived in the past but I think that the reason why the program is still around today is that the the congressman from tobacco growing state, it's are able to keep the program from being voted on in a single vote on the floor of the House of the Senate Pompano Beach Florida go ahead yes I do my name is Bob I'd like to just call as a part of the 20% that do smoke I guess I know you've mentioned alcohol and drugs and various other things yeah I do believe that the cigarettes are addictive I'm an alcoholic drug addict, ex and I just I'm just really confused by the priorities of you know suddenly the smokers are the bad people, and you know the drug addicts and you know that that thing doesn't end enter into mr. coops presentations years ago or anything like that, flying on planes starting Sunday without smoking cigarettes I'm more offended by that but I'm also anything else I'd say thank you I think dr. Koop was filling a void in making a big issue out of tobacco because we've had a War on Drugs now for a long time and we've had high government officials and many other people making the war on drugs illegal drugs something that we probably hear more about than any other thing in our society so I, I don't think that tobacco is now getting a disproportionate amount of attention in fact it's getting attention that is long overdue tobacco smoke contains 4,000 chemicals including 43 that are known to cause cancer and so it's unfair to have non-smokers breathe in such a toxic gas in an enclosed environment like an airplane where they can't get up and walk away and in fact the National Academy of Sciences estimated that a flight attendant who was exposed to tobacco, smoke on airplanes is exposed to the equivalent amount of smoke as somebody who lives with a pack a day smoker so it's not an insignificant amount of exposure and we're talking about a very deadly gas here dr. Dave has time for one last call this one from Cheyenne Wyoming go ahead yeah I might mean reason I just wanted to call I told my children repeatedly about smoking and the main reason I won't quit smoking his I keep watching the government tell me I've got to do this and I've got to do that and until the, government gets out of my personal life, I'll just keep smoking how do you believe the government is telling you to quit smoking well after reading most of the studies that come out because my kids always hand them to me and having lived around scientists most of my life everyone in the quit smoking deal is keep saying we think we suppose, that isn't science that's a guess all right so thank you well I can say to that is that there no guesses around here there have been more than 50,000 scientific studies that have determined that cigarette smoking is harmful to health it's probably the most well-documented scientific finding in the history of biomedical research and if you won't quit smoking for the government quit smoking for your children because children whose parents smoke are not only more likely to get pneumonia and bronchitis, other respiratory diseases are more likely to take up smoking themselves because of the role model that you're setting and I have somebody in my family who's had a stroke caused by smoking and this person is in a vegetative state for 10 years now and think of the burden that that poses on a family and it's not just a decision that you're making that affects you it affects your children and your family and everyone around you final word in 15 seconds, I think the main point that needs to be made here is that of all the behaviors that we could do that are dangerous cigarette smoking is at the top of the list 390,000 people dying every year from this Behavior more than 1,000 a day people could do more for their health by quitting smoking than by any other single step thank you dr. Ronald Davis appreciate your time tonight thank you, we'll continue our discussion I ain't discussion on smoking and health this time with two different points of view represented by Walker merryman he's the vice president of the tobacco Institute and Aaron Lightman he's the president of citizens against tobacco smoke will be back in a few minutes, a universal newsreel of 1961 President John F Kennedy he's first year in office and his first State of the Union Address, the Congress convenes and join session to hear President Kennedy's first state of the union message a grave challenge to the nation and the legislature to prepare for serious perils abroad and economic recession at home the president proclaimed this a time of national Peril and of national opportunity as he sums up the economic picture, in short the American economy is in trouble the most resourceful industrialized country on Earth ranks among the Lost in the rate of economic growth since last spring our economic growth rate has actually declined business investment is in a declined profits have fallen below predicted levels construction is off a million unsold automobiles are an inventory, fewer people are working and the average work week as shrug well below 40 hours yet prices have continued to rise so that now too many Americans have less to spend for items that cost more to buy no man entering upon this office regardless of his party regardless of his previous service in Washington could fail to be staggered, upon learning even then this brief 10-day period the harsh enormities of the trials through which we must pass in the next four years each day the crises multiply each day their solution grows more difficult each day we draw nearer the hour of Maximum danger As Weapons spread and hostile forces grow stronger, I feel I must inform the Congress that our analysis over the next last 10 days make it clear that in each of the principal areas of Crisis the tide of events has been running out and time has not been our friend, mr. Kennedy refers to the Soviet Challenge and Latin America we are pledged to work with our sister republics to free the Americas of all such foreign domination and all tyranny working towards the goal of a free hemisphere of free governments extending from Cape Horn to the Arctic Circle we must increase our support of the, Nations as an instrument to end the Cold War instead of an arena in which to fight it in recognition of its increasing importance and the doubling of its membership we are enlarging and strengthening our own mission to the UN we shall help ensure that it is properly financed we shall work to see that the Integrity of the office of the Secretary General is maintained, wife and 1961 will not be easy wishing it predicting it even asking for it will not make it so there will be further setbacks before the tide has turned but turn it we must, go behind the scenes of the events and issues you can following on C-Span subscribe to the C-SPAN update designed with the C-SPAN

from citizens against tobacco smoke and Walker merryman vice-president of the tobacco Institute will take your questions and comments about smoking policies on airplanes tobacco advertising and a bill now in Congress to fight smoking, Walker merryman vice-president of the tobacco Institute what in your judgment is the proper role of the Federal Government in the matter of smoking, I think the role of the Federal Government with respect to smoking is to give people information which they have an abundance of much of it from the government much of it from the media and then to leave people alone to make their own decisions about whether or not they wish to smoke let me ask the same question will probably get a different point of view this from Aaron Lightman he's the president of citizens against tobacco smoke what's the proper role of the government we feel the proper role of the government is to protect the public health and, that can be done in several ways including the distribution of information but each day in this nation we have a very rich and Powerful tobacco industry spending an average of seven and a half million dollars a day promoting The Addictive and harmful tobacco products and the federal government each year only spends three and a half million dollars a year so we have twice the annual budget spent daily by the tobacco industry and that is about to change under some newly proposed Federal legislation, pleased to have our guest this evening each representing a different side in the debate on smoking and we expect that they'll want to have plenty of time to get their points of view on the table and you'll like the same so we're opening the phones right now we'll put the phone numbers on the screen so you can begin dialing as you think about what you would say to them or ask them and we'll go to the phone straight away after we learn a little bit more about who they are and where they stand back to you mr. Merriman quickly a little bit about the tobacco Institute the tobacco Institute is the trade Association that represents, represents the nation cigarette manufacturers and manufacturers of other tobacco products we do lobbying we do public relations were based here in Washington DC and have been since 1958 how big is your budget that's something we don't make public mr. Lightman same thing what is citizens against tobacco smoke well one of the things we do is try and find out what the budget of the tobacco industry or Institute is and according to Congressional sources it is something like 30 million dollars a year which is quite a substantial budget, citizens against tobacco smoke was formed in October of 1985 at the conclusion of the First World Conference on non-smokers rights which was sponsored by action on smoking and health here in Washington DC we started out as a coalition of forty two groups and decided to do something about this issue of Airline smoking and we created a campaign known as smoke free Skies it did take us three and a half years to win the airline smoking ban which takes effect this son, and a February 25th and on that ban all flights that begin and end in the United States under six hours of length will be affected that's virtually 99 and 44 100 percent of the nation's 18,000 domestic airline flights and it has been heralded as one of the most significant victories we've had against the tobacco industry in the history of the US Congress and how big is your budget we have a very miniscule budget which is proprietary all right so, you want to offer a guess as to his budget I've no idea it really fascinates me that people have an interest in other people's monetary Affairs well let me go back to the subject at hand that is and I'll ask you both this before we go to the phones they report on smoking and health that was required by Congress was presented to it by a doctor Louis Sullivan on Tuesday what's your reaction to the contents of that report well as I recall the vast amount of media coverage, courage was focused on that portion of his testimony and Report which had to do with what he called the social costs of smoking and I think it's inappropriate to put it in that context because any costs that might be incurred if you accept the the argument that smokers are likely to die earlier if they smoke and so forth are personal individual costs which aren't born by, Wyatt e as a whole and I think that if you take the argument to that that step then what you're implying perhaps more stronger than implying is that the individual is the property of the state and that therefore the state has a right to dictate that individuals behavior that is a philosophical difference that and I'm not willing to accept that by the way I think that individuals in this country have a right to make their own informed decisions about whether or not they wish to smoke or, age in other activities that might present some risk mr. Lightman your reaction to the report I have not read the report yet I was traveling on the day it was issue I've read news summaries of it I think the figure being used of 50 some billion dollars is probably a most conservative figure because in 1985 Congress did Issue a report that smoking was costing this nation somewhere between 65 billion in ninety billion dollars in direct health care costs lost productivity, an early morbidity representative for Tony Stark has concluded that smoking cost this nation ten million dollars an hour which is certainly significant and employers do pay for the health care costs of their employees and there is a lot of smoking-related disease in this country 390,000 people lose their lives every year from tobacco related illnesses let's put another issue on the table before we go to the phones mr. Lightman Senator Kennedy has introduced a bill called s 1880, III otherwise known as The Tobacco education and Control Act of 1990 what's in it and what do you think about it we are very pleased that Senator Kennedy and his labor and Human Resources committee or taking the leadership role that they are taking with this issue this would create a center for tobacco products education and control in the federal government estimates range somewhere between 50 billion and 100 billion dollars one of the things I like about the bill, the fact that the government will now get involved in counter advertising as you recall when tobacco companies advertised on television back in the 60s and 50s there was a law that came into being that required broadcasters to make the equal amount of time available to the anti-smoking groups to put out a pro health message we feel if this is done in print in newspapers and magazines we can Mock and ridicule, you'll these ads and drive the companies from print the same way we drove them off the airwaves mr. Merriman well I think it's very clear that this bill's premise is that Americans don't have any information about smoking and health I don't know how anyone could seriously make that argument at least with a straight face it's very clear that Americans are more aware of smoking and health issues than they know that we have to import oil to meet our energy needs as a matter of fact we learned through analysis, closest of public opinion data that more people are aware of the smoking and health issues and what the Surgeon General and others say about smoking then know who George Washington was I don't think it's credible for anyone to say or even believe that Americans don't have information about smoking and health they certainly do almost everything that is in this bill with a few exceptions is already covered in legislation that's already on the books, I think it's duplicative and wasteful and unnecessary you both follow Capitol Hill and before we go to the phone's let me ask you quickly do you expect this or any part of it to become law I have a hard time looking at a crystal ball really I can't give you an answer I don't think frankly that there are too many people in Congress however who really want to go through another battle on smoking issues mr. Lightman the battle has just begun with the airline smoking, van which we've recently won it may take a year or two or possibly three for this legislation to become a reality but we think it will be enacted just want to conclude by saying that most information that most people get on a daily basis comes to them through the form of these advertising images and the tobacco industry is spending two and a half billion dollars a year promoting the products and that's what people know about smoking Marlboro Etc, all of the messages all right let's go to the phones we've got half an hour to go we'll spend it all with your calls our guest wolterman of the tobacco Institute and are Enlightenment of citizens against tobacco smoke and the first call for them is from Irvine California go ahead please yes I'm curious to know the change in the movie industry I see a lot of movies I noticing that there's a gradual return to the smoking after on film and you know that in the 40s and 50s and 60s that was, is quite common and then it kind of went away now I'm seeing that I'm disappointed to see this in terms of shows like The Fabulous Baker Boys and Stella where the actors are starting to smoke again my question is is the tobacco industry a big fund supporter of the movie industry thank you mr. Merriman to the best of my knowledge no there have been literally thousands of films made in the last decade there have been occasions as I understand it when, backhoe companies have been approached by producers and asked to place their products in films and that has occurred on a very very few occasions the vast majority of cases however it's done without the approval consent or even knowledge of the tobacco companies I would disagree as an independent motion picture and producer and writer which is what I am by trade I'm aware of the fact that the industry the tobacco industry and specifically companies like, Philip Morris pay tens of thousands of dollars to have their products placed on the motion picture screen however if you look at the motion pictures that the caller just cited you'll find that their period pieces and in order to accurately reflect a situation from 1950 or even the 60s you will see some smoking however if you look at the genre of motion picture that is produced in 1990 or the late 80s you do find less smoking you also find the surgeon general's, morning appearing at the end of a recent James Bond movie because they did pay to have the brand promoted on the screen Fort Worth Texas you're on the air yeah I would like to make a comment I am a nun smoker my grandmother is 99 years old my grandfather is 100 years old they have both smoked all of their life now as I see it I do not think that anybody has the right to tell a, person they could smoke where or when and I am very much against these non-smokers as a surgeon general's warning now on cigarettes it does not say smoking causes cancer it's just quitting smoking make greatly reduce serious risk to your help so nobody can prove that smoking causes cancer or not thank you Aaron Lightman well the government has proved it in there more than 50,000 studies that, the eight tobacco use with disease disability and death and if the caller would read the other labels smoking does cause lung cancer and emphysema and it also causes birth defects you don't see the word birth defect written on the side of the pack because that was a political compromise made with the tobacco industry no one in their right mind today doubts anything about how harmful tobacco use is I would like to ask mr. Merriman for the record does, backhoe use cause cancer I think the caller was making an important point and that is that it's an individual's right to make a decision and I think that she also made the point very clearly perhaps clearer than I could that information about smoking issues contrary to what Aaron would like us to believe is certainly pervasive throughout Society I doubt if there's an individual in your audience tonight who can say that he or she has not heard of or does not know what the surgeon general's warning, the is and means therefore it seems to me it's an individual's decision about whether or not to smoke and the government cannot take that right from an individual what is the tobacco industry think though does smoking cause disease I don't know if it does or not Aaron and I think that anyone in the audience can make his or her own judgment about that Vernon New Jersey is next go ahead thank you you're on the air thank you, in go ahead hello I'd like to ask please if the moderator would make his first question back to mr. leichman because I feel that mr. Berryman answered and it's like man did not and that question was what is the proper role of the Federal Government in the matter of smoking exactly all right government government has the right and the obligation to protect the public health and tobacco smoke is harmful to non-smokers in places like The Airliner cabin that's why we, now have a federal law that takes effect February 25 Banning smoking on virtually every domestic flight in this country so if you're asking whether or not government should taken a stand or an issue the answer for me is certainly yes I would love to see a workplace smoking ban enacted by the federal government throughout this country that would take place in every state and local community so quite frankly I think the, the government has not gone far enough it is left this up to State and local governments and mr. Merriman represents an industry that is Rich and powerful and lobbies of very effectively at the state level and local level but it's funny that the anti-smoking groups are really winning this war we are enacting so many of these non smoker protection laws at the local level it's difficult to even keep track of the most recently Montgomery County Maryland has virtually banned smoking in the workplace, that takes effect in about 90 days San Diego you're on the air all right I can kind of see both sides of this issue I and I'm a nonsmoker and I enjoy going to a restaurant or flying on a plane or I don't have to be around cigarette smoke but at the same time I can I understand mr. Merriman's position about people making their own choices it gets tiring to see the federal government sticking their fingers in everything that everybody does you know if, we could have cars that were only going 55 miles an hour with Governors on them because the federal government doesn't think that we could take care of ourselves so there's so many ways that this could could go not only in smoking but you know I also am concerned about the number of jobs that are at stake as well as the individuals right all right thank you mr. Merriman well I think the caller makes a good point that there has to be a very logical Point Beyond which, government need not go and I think that we've demonstrated in this country that people can make their own decisions about things that might entail some risk like smoking you can't very well expect the government to ban the product although I know some people in the anti-smoking movements would prefer that but I know that as well I have confidence in the ability of adults in this country to make their own informed judgment and not to rely upon the government to a sensor, information whether it's commercial or otherwise or to try to make that decision for them I'm also concerned about the access that youth have to tobacco products does a 13 year old girl have enough information to make a choice whether or not she smokes and becomes addicted to tobacco use when there is not even anything on the label that says that the product is addictive now mr. Merriman contends that the, it is not addictive the surgeon general's report a couple years ago said it was I think the evidence is clear and overwhelming on that issue mr. Merriman represents an industry that has never admitted any harm whatsoever about tobacco and all he says is that let the buyer beware let the mature adult make the decision I'm concerned about the 4,000 children in this nation every day who make the decision to take up tobacco use Norfolk Virginia, you're on the air yeah go ahead please Norfolk Virginia and I'm a 55 year old man I've been spoken before I started first grade which put me about 5 years old and, at that time when I first started smoking a cost on the first drag, and then after I finished that cigarette I could smoke again and again again again and then throughout the years to cigarettes were pretty good back then and then the man put a filter on that he was trying to tell you something that he put some other attitudes in it, you know cart that is telling me something right there what's it tell you all right I found a medical library book not a dictionary it said this was copyrighted back in 1927 a medical library book and it said that tobacco was poisoned it's how the man treat the backer it's not hey cures it is hey treats it all right sir and, he just told some of it but all right think he just said the doctor Koop didn't tell the whole story he just told some of the things do you have a response mr. Merriman well I think former Surgeon General Coupe and the surgeons General who preceded him have told all of the story that I think Americans want to hear I think a lot of Americans believe that they've heard as much as they need to about smoking and health issues they want to make their own decisions not agree with her, but it's not appropriate for kids to smoke I don't think cigarettes ought to be sold to kids and I think as well that the tobacco industry has a pretty enviable near 30-year record of voluntary initiatives trying to avoid advertising and marketing directed at kids and also trying to work with retailers and others to make certain that cigarettes aren't sold two youngsters nobody's going to be perfect in this regard nothing like a perfect enforcement record could ever be a, accomplished but I think it's certainly worth giving it a good try and we've been doing it for a very long time, only in the bizarre world of the tobacco industry Can someone say that the companies are granting women for example with freedom and greater Independence when in fact it's hooking them on an addictive drug the most addictive drug known to man it is rather obvious that most people don't know that nicotine is a poison a drop of nicotine on your tongue will kill you and there are also pesticides and insecticides used, in the curing of tobacco that are highly toxic there was a batch of Winston cigarettes that unfortunately contained some of these residues and it was shipped to Japan Unfortunately they found the product contaminated before it got onto the shelves but what we're dealing with is a virtually unregulated industry that is about to come under much more government scrutiny Chelmsford Massachusetts thank you so much I thank you for these bad having this, on the air today I am never have smoked ever and I never thought I could ever be harmed by secondary smoke but I can hardly breathe now and I've never smoked I can't avoid being around the smoker because of what this gentleman is saying that they have their right to make their own decisions and that certainly is true however they don't have the right to make a decision to smoke in an area where there are non-smokers, and they have to recognize the fact that they're harming us desperately I have very bad lung problem I've been working for three years stupidly it's not through my own fault I have to help make a living and I have constantly been working towards getting a smoke-free environment and they keep putting me off and putting me off saying that they're going to do something about it I now have to work partly out of my home this the smoking has what you said is a poison, is absolutely correct I'm amazed at the amount of people who are calling you and don't recognize when they go into a mall for instance I cannot breathe air okay mayor thank you very much mr. Merriman well I think that one thing the caller was expressing is something that people who own and operate and manage businesses in this country deal with every day and that is what is the appropriate smoking policy for that business this is something again that the tobacco industry has helped, labor groups all over the country in an attempt to who come to an accommodation of smokers and non-smokers in their Workforce and their customers to try to decide what's an appropriate smoking policy a blanket policy isn't going to work for every kind of business but I think that most employers and most businesses in this country realize that smoking policies just a good part of doing business and the vast majority of them do have a policy on smoking owners and Proprietors of business do, don't really have a say in the kind of quality of water that comes through the tap we do have clean water standards and it is fairly certain that if you drink tap water in from any business in this country it's going to be clean we are now encouraging employers and owners and Proprietors of businesses to ban smoking in the workplace the problem of non-smokers being forced to breathe tobacco smoke should not be treated as a mere nuisance to be resolved by good manners courtesy and, strength it should be treated as a severe threat to Public Health requiring government action and we are seeing that government action in virtually every state in the Union and we're going to be seeing a lot more of it we've got 15 minutes to go as we're talking with representatives of the tobacco Institute and citizens against tobacco smoke for the remainder of that time and before we take the next call let me ask mr. Merriman and mr. Lightman there is a free speech issue here to what extent do you think, that if the tobacco Institute is prevails in Congress that it will be on constitutional grounds rather than some other grounds that really has to do with the issue of advertising of the product that is commercial speech as the Supreme Court has called it a number of Supreme Court decisions since 1976 have clearly and inexorably extended their interpretation of First Amendment, to commercial speech as long as what is being said is truthful and the product is legal the Supreme Court has said the government will have an extremely difficult time Banning that commercial speech that advertising there simply is is no getting around the fact that the First Amendment as the Supreme Court of the United States has interpreted it does in fact apply to commercial speech now it's not going to protect someone who wants to say that putting, we're so coated Timber on your head is going to grow hair because obviously that's not true but the court has said in a number of decisions involving other products and services that the First Amendment which involves commercial speech advertising does extend protection to advertisers and I think that's a very good reason why Congress has been very very leery of getting into any area which would ban advertising or restrict it from certain media the broadcast ban, advertising went into effect in 1971 that was about five years before The Supreme Court started issuing opinions on Commercial freedom of speech there have been opinion since then that have that have restricted commercial speech on casino gambling but that doesn't have anything to do with cigarette advertising since the cigarettes are sold in every state casino gambling is not legal in every state so I think that it's very clear that the high court has intended that first amendment protections be, it ended in as broad a measure as possible to commercial speech for legal products that is truthful you expect the Constitutional grounds to be strong on your behalf every hearing that's been held in Congress on this issue has really focused on the Constitutional aspects but the First Amendment means how far does it extend what do constitutional Scholars have to say about it and the clear impression I get is that when you get organizations like the American, civil liberties Union and the Washington Legal Foundation on each end of the political Spectrum supporting the right of tobacco companies to advertise then you've got a pretty full circle are Enlightenment the Constitutional issue is an interesting one quite frankly it is also a very narrow and quite boring but if you do look at the record from July 18 1986 and August 1 1986 the first series of hearings, ings and order a copy of the book from Congressman waxman's office you will see a fascinating discussion on exactly what the tobacco industry is doing with its advertising and marketing in the targeting of Youth the sophisticated high-powered advertising that really glamorizes smoking the tobacco industry is really not selling cigarettes as much as they are the very concept of smoking including luring unsuspecting women and children, to a highly addictive habit the question was do you believe that the Constitutional grounds are strong on behalf of the smoking or the tobacco Institute no they're not because commercial speech does not give the manufacturer the right to lie or deceive the public about a product or the health impact of the product okay San Bernardino California go ahead good afternoon good afternoon I come from a big family don't smoker but I believe it is none of the government's business to tell people how to run their life, life and if they supposed to print all the dangers of tobacco why don't they print also all the poison of like they're giving us in the food and that time milk with the bovine hormones which is very damaging to the health because everything I'm 67 and we never never had any key to dying of cancer like we have today and the heater not smokers all right I think we have the right to know all the person that we are getting on our fruits and vegetables my sister last year was for all guys, a few for my with a fainting spell certain block out everything and Africa to explain everything I told her you father you eating until it stopped in the fruit and boy has it get take garlic and take a lot of lemon juice and water and you better believe it she got well and because she went to the doctor and they convert nothing wrong with her okay ma'am thank you are like man what do you think of that parallel well I'm not sure the parallel is a sound when I think the most misperceived thing about the anti-smoking movement is, that people want to tell other people really how to live their lives what we're looking for is protection from tobacco smoke and we want to remove the access of tobacco products to Children cigarette vending machines is they are doing very successfully they're banning them all over the state of Minnesota now where children have access to them any kid can go into a restaurant and throw five or six quarters into one of these vending machines and get this highly addictive product and become hooked to it when you look at the, ception in the Distortion and the undermining of all the massive amount of medical evidence which proves the toxic case against cigarettes you have to look at the industry that is promoting this product I think mr. Merriman is practically admitted today that the tobacco industry does not admit that its products are harmful to anyone and that in and of itself says a lot welcome Aaron I'm just fascinated Aaron at your lack of ability to give people in this country credit for little common sense, if what you say is true than everyone in this country ought to be puffing away three packs a day obviously that doesn't happen people make their own decisions about smoking you're not mesmerised by every cigarette advertisement you see thankfully the percentage of youngsters smoking in recent years has been declining I think it's very clear that cigarette advertising appeals to people who smoke trying to get them to switch their brands or maintain their loyalty to the current brand and I do, I think that the anti-smoking movement really does itself Proud by promoting censorship harassment and sumptuously Taxation well we're not promoting me I'll go ahead please yeah I'm a former smoker I was wondering I've got a younger sister who's going to turn 15 next month and she's been smoking and I see all her friends smoking and the way I see it the only way to keep them from taking at this habit is to ban tobacco products and I was wondering our question is if we can win this War on Drugs, that is why couldn't we win a war on Tobacco well tobacco is a gateway drug and if we are serious about waging a War on Drugs we must start with tobacco I don't think your 15 year old sister is mature enough to make the decision that mr. Merriman gives her credit for being mature enough to make because every day in this nation 4,000 kids do take up this product and mr. Merriman knows that if they're not targeting children with their messages who are they targeting because, adults don't begin to smoke it is the children and the vulnerable youth who take up this product it's so like you are in to misrepresent what I've said at no time during the program have I said that a 15 year-old has the maturity or the judgment to make a decision about smoking I think it's very clear that adults have the right to make that judgment every state has laws which are admittedly difficult to enforce to try to keep kids from smoking but I don't think that, difficulty and enforcement is any reason to abandon the effort the tobacco industry doesn't want kids as customers we've made that very clear over the past 25 or 30 years we've tried to take voluntary initiatives to prevent that and I think it's also very clear that at the same time we believe that adults have the right to make that choice and I don't think that Aaron or his group or the federal government for that matter has any writer obligation responsibility to try to take that right away from others after this next, call I want to ask you both about tobacco subsidies because it came up in the previous segment and I think we owe it to our audience to get an answer from the people who are most likely to know but before that Richmond Kentucky is next go ahead please yes Richmond I'm a 31 year old male I've only worked in tobacco two years I'm a nonsmoker my friends that stoop to smoking smoke on the stoop outside and are happy with me about the decision I just like to ask both Advocates a question mr. Lichtman, I'm wondering does the taxpayer still pay substitute to the extent of an entire Year's interest on the wholesale market and to mr. Merriman are there any product for uses of tobacco such as hemp which can be used for making rope and textiles okay first mr. Lightman I am aware that to administer the tobacco price support program in this nation according to the tobacco industry is an estimated, added 12 to 15 million dollars a year just to administer the price supports now I can't tell you how much each farmer gets to support the product I do know this if you banned all of the price supports it would be the tobacco industry the six cigarette companies who would start growing the product and then the price would probably Skyrocket the decision is whether or not this nation is going, allow the commercial growing promotion and marketing of an addictive product that kills three hundred and ninety thousand people a year okay we're running out of time quickly mr. Merriman sounds to me are unlike you're promoting a ban on the product you've all you say is true that seems to be the logical endpoint of your argument let me say very clearly and briefly there's no such thing as a tobacco subsidy 12 to 15 million dollars aram's talking about Sin administrative cost, that cost would be there whether or not there was a tobacco program administered by the federal government quickly the question about a non-smoking use of tobacco the color suggested hemp for rope and that kind of thing do you know of any such use researchers have identified very high quality proteins in tobacco which can be extracted and used as food additives even higher quality than soy protein for example the process is expensive but it is one possible alternative use for tobacco league and quickly the question that came up in the last segment, was when was the last Congressional vote on the tobacco subsidy or support program or whatever you want to call it you call either within the last two to four years I believe there will be some Congressional consideration of not only Omnibus Farm legislation in the coming session but the last one program was couple years ago you think two to four years ago same I don't know I think the next big issue is the increase on the federal excise tax of tobacco products which less one of the next big battles is the our last call and, we need time to come A Washington go ahead please and please be brief yeah I like to know knowing that alcohol and tobacco are drugs why our government hasn't classified as drugs okay thank you welcome Merriman well I don't agree with the characterization that tobacco is a drug in the first place Congress in its wisdom has decided to retain most regulation of tobacco in and of itself tobacco is extremely highly regulated there's a now, but soup of federal agencies and also state and local governments that regulate tobacco and smoking in one way or another so certainly tobacco hasn't escaped regulation if that's the import of the impact of the caller's question Erin Lightman according to the National Institute on drug abuse nicotine is highly addictive we know that the average smoker smokes 30 cigarettes a day that's 50 to 60 thousand doses or hits of nicotine every year no other form of drug use occurs with such frequency irregularity and I think dr. David said in, the first part of the program 80% of the smokers say they want to quit and the new legislation that we now see Banning smoking on airplanes and in workplaces really gives smokers a chance to quit we've got about half a minute for each of you to say a word about where you are Walker Merriman well I think that very clearly with this, Airline smoking band coming up on Sunday anyone who's read the latest Department of Transportation report on are cabin quality shouldn't be concerned about environmental tobacco smoke in aircraft as one scientist put at the exposure to non-smokers is biologically insignificant and it's minimal I think it's legislation with lack of information I think Congress was stampeded by some anti-smoking activists who decided this was a good horse to ride and now they're making the best of it, Aaron Lightman half a minute well we are certainly undergoing some fundamental social changes about smoking I am not opposed to adults smoking as long as they don't smoke in public and as long as the toxic and harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke which number about 4,000 and are carcinogenic mutagenic and pharmacologically active don't harm innocent people whether it's in the workplace restaurants or The Airliner cabin we are, seeing history being made this was the most significant victory in the last couple of years over the tobacco industry and it will lead to other victories but we're not out telling Society how to live we just want to give smokers protection to breathe clean air we all share the public are thank you both Walker merryman of the tobacco Institute and Aaron Lightman of citizens against tobacco smoke appreciate your time, and so our audience thanks for watching have a good evening, that concludes this evening's calling programs a note that will bring you a special on the 25th anniversary of the assassination of Malcolm X and that will come up Saturday afternoon at about 4 p.m. eastern time after the short break oh look at foreign policy",0.8438949468367342,0.69165844,0.91283923

ghhb0039,"and the winner by unanimous decision and still heavyweight champion of the world my boy and what a fight it was Lynn anytime you put two heavyweights like Marlborough and Winston against each other you have to expect the fight to go the full 12 rounds in case you just joined us I'm Sam Hendrix along with Lyn beazley wrapping up the fight between select full flavor and Marlboro it was a great fight, right Sam but it was a disappointing loss for the RJ our fighter when you analyze the fight the select full flavor fighter failed to impress the judges who are discriminating smokers select came on strong in the late rounds but it just wasn't enough to win the decision right now we're standing by in the select Fighters locker room to talk to team select about what they learn from the fight and how they're changing their strategy for the August 2nd rematch in Winston-Salem even though we didn't win tonight's fight we learned a lot about our strategy our, under and ourselves having field sales in our Corner really helped us make some positive changes in our strategy which paid off in the latter rounds of the fight you're right friend we introduced select as the new fighter from Winston he was designed to appeal to those judges who typically score in favor of Marlborough select came out fighting really hard in the earlier rounds we dazed Marlboro by stealing a point 59 share market and select scored high with judges who don't like base Winston select also fared well with females, those smokers ages 21 to 34 and smokers who prefer the Box style of fighter but early into the fight after the excitement of the introduction was over some smokers saw select is just another Winston in fact some smokers thought select was replacing Winston King, that told us we position select too closely to base Winston we confused smokers they weren't sure if select was a Marlboro look-alike or Winston a new trunks the early rounds taught us that our advertising promotion and packaging has to make select look like a new generation of fighter have a different style from all other Winston Fighters and deliver on smooth once we figured that out rounds 10 through 12 turned around select came out with a whole new look that scored well, select opened in the 10th with a flurry of combinations to the body a strong first quarter buy one get one free punch and advertising punch the challenge tomorrow Oberon smooth and a clear message that said selects not just another Winston just look at the scoring the extra points reflected clear gains there is no doubt we've got momentum and the potential to become a future Contender but we can't underestimate the champ Marlboros a fierce competitor and won't lay down it's clear Winston can't fight both, Marlborough and savings with current lineup savings has rapidly become a real Contender and Winston lights did not fare well on its bout with Marlboro Lights last year Winston lights lost over a SharePoint while Marlboro Lights gained more than three in the full price non-mental light segment the fact is Winston just doesn't have a fighter to compete in the whitetip Lites class until camel special lights hit the scene Marlboro Lights was the uncontested champ select light Springs real power to the fight he joins the, let contenders at a time when select full flavor has momentum field sales and marketing work together to dress him in a new contemporary package that's cream smooth the new product blend on both lights and full flavor delivers on smooth advertising and promotion not only shouts new and smooth it also announces we're going toe-to-toe against the champ if Marlboro Lights is your idea of smooth we challenged it and on top of that the introductory promotion plan have a buy one get, get one free and to worth it notes is unprecedented we don't plan to pull any punches in our August rematch with Marlborough well Sam there you have it team select feels the strategy shift late in the fight really establishes their full flavor fighter as new and different from base Winston it smooth message is clear and they see their real shot at the title coming from select lights do you think that'll really make a difference absolutely you saw in the late rounds that select full flavor when position correctly responds to promotion and you can tell from, the packaging advertising and promotion plan that team select has learned from their Marketplace experience and adjusted their strategy for lights the packaging just says different from base once it's so smooth the advertising shows the marble smooth Challenge and the promotion plan is unprecedented Glenn with the new product Blends I got a winner it could go all the way, ladies and gentlemen welcome to the main event of the night this fight will determine the heavyweight championship of the world in the blue Corner wearing blue trunks with white trim is the Challenger Winston select lights and in the Red Corner wearing gold trunks with black trim the reigning heavyweight champion of the world but overall lights the fight is scheduled for a full 12 rounds the standing eight count will be, in effect you cannot be Saved by the Bell well in we know the strategies of both corners for tonight's fight and it looks like this could turn out to be a real bra I have to say the select light spider looks very focused tonight I don't think I've ever seen a new fighter look so smooth there's no question Winston and RJ are are expecting a lot out of Select lights but there are Rumblings about whether tonight's fight may affect our Jr.'s current number one Contender camel special lights before, the fight we talked to camels team managers at Blackmore and John alligator we asked John if he thought tonight's fight with select lights was going to hurt camel special lights chances as a future Contender I don't think so if we're Smart in how we manage the two fighters look our generous goal is to knock out the champ so specialized and select lights must work as a team not against each other during the introduction of Select lights are gr can't afford to give up any of the gains, is that we've already made with the special lights introduction special lights must remain a number one Contender that means we need to maintain advertising and promotional presence behind special lights to sustain momentum Ed do you agree that's right John the field will have to manage each fighter to ensure both come out as Champions we're smart management select in special lights should appeal to different groups of Marlboro smokers select can take the head on product challenge while, lights leverages and broadens the appeal of the Joe Camel image the two approaches can each be very effective but to win this fight the field will need to ensure that both Fighters keep Landing punches on Marlboro thanks John and Ed for those comments let's go up to the ring now for round one there's the Bell select is out of the corner look at that smooth footwork he opens with a left cross of challenge advertising but catches the Marlborough fighter off guard marvelous stung by selects combination of 100, a soft pack and some light spots that should really score with the female judges this new select fighter is up for the challenge tonight the Marlborough fighter looks a bit dazed and is beginning to show his age just look at select lights measuring up his opponent with an Eagle Eye the question is can select lights finish off the tank but the buy one get one free and but packs and cartons okay there's the Bell ending round one the two fighters returned to their Corners well in the challenges new strategy seems to be affected this fight could be going the full 12 hours, rounds we've got to take a break but smokers stay tuned we'll be here for the duration ladies and gentlemen mr. Yancey Ford from what we've all just seen it looks like we have the makings of a really good fight on our hands and I'm just as anxious as you to throw some more hard punches at Marlboro I like to reinforce some key points on this introduction, we have moved up the plan launch of Select lights as you know Philip Morris recent moves with their Marlboro summer promotion have dramatically changed the face of the industry we believe that these events make now and even better time to capture Marlboro smokers who are in the store looking for promotion while it means more work for our sales team we firmly believe doing so will pay off against a vulnerable Marlborough Winston is losing shared his savings and, Marlboro our company cannot afford for this trend to continue select is the only way Winston can become a strong brand again base Winston products have low appeal to Marlboro smokers the select challenge program has proven that we can attract more over smokers when they try select but without select lights however the momentum behind this brand is limited and you should be very proud of your role in the select lights introduction it was your excellent, back and suggestions on select full flavor that led to critical changes in the Brand's look and strategy and enable the introduction to be accelerated as Lenin Sam explained our Jr has been underrepresented in the white tip lights category camel special lights has already demonstrated great appeal among those smokers but select lights is crucial for broadening our opportunity and boxing lingo it becomes a two in our 12, ooh punch that means we'll need sustained effort behind camel special lights we can't afford to lose the momentum you have built on special lights since its introduction in April camel special light should remain on P CDs and advertising and promotional presence should be maintained well that should be primary or secondary is your call its Position will depend on its performance and potential in that store you should pay particular attention to the guy, guidelines in your introductory books to ensure support of both camel special lights and select lights the success of these two Brands is critical in our fight against Marlboro that strategies are strong and unique yet complement each other with select taking Marlborough head-on with the smooth Challenge and special lights leveraging the Joe Camel image the two strategies should appeal to different groups of Marlborough smokers, thereby broadening and maximizing our Jr.'s opportunity, it's really quite simple we've got two tremendous opportunities to convince Marlboro smokers we've got a better product for them these brands are your top two priorities and I have every confidence you'll make them both successful, now it's time for you to jump into the ring and give Marlboro fight they'll never forget",0.8429599748,0.7362867,0.91175634

ghxb0079,"this morning we would like to begin a process that we believe is long overdue we would like to bring some balance to the debate surrounding secondhand smoke and other issues concerning cigarettes in America, and would like to establish an open dialogue with members of the media and members of the public so that we can better understand both sides of this issue, during the past couple of years there have been a lot of misconceptions surrounding secondhand smoke including claims that exposure to secondhand smoke was actually more dangerous than active smoking but as dr. Collins will detail in just a minute, studies show that secondhand smoke is highly diluted and on average people are exposed to very small quantities of second-hand smoke, let's make no mistake about it the goal of the anti-smoking industry is to bring back Prohibition in the United States, when confronted they'll tell you they don't want prohibition but their actions belie their words, and if you don't believe that's the case just look it's how extreme some of these efforts are like trying to people prohibit people from smoking Outdoors, or for smoking in public parks smoking in their cars even smoking in their own homes, consider this the alcohol prohibition movement started with the anti-alcohol supporters claiming that their goal was simply temperance, I would like to make Reynolds tobacco's position very clear we are not saying that smokers should be free to light up wherever they want whenever they want without considering the wishes of others but we do believe that the 45 million American adults who choose to smoke should be and can be afforded reasonable accommodations, and we share the Public's overwhelming opposition to Prohibition, there are common-sense ways to work out the problems without turning 45 million Americans into Outlaws and social outcasts, we understand that some people find secondhand smoke annoying no two ways about it but we also know that most Americans prefer common courtesy and Common Sense not government mandate to solve any problems that might arise, we believe that it's very important that the American public understand both sides of this issue so that they can make informed choices, to that end today we are launching a public information campaign that opens the debate on a number of issues our first effort appeared this morning in a number of major dailies I'm sure many of you have seen it as this ad points out non-smokers are typically exposed to very small quantities of second-hand smoke, just what is secondhand smoke you must understand that secondhand smoke is not the same as mainstream smoke or sidestream smoke it is hundreds to thousands of times more diluted, just how much secondhand smoke are non-smokers exposed to the answer is very little put in plain English any material can be made dangerous if the dose is big enough, the concentrations measured in millionths of a gram per cubic meter the typical levels typically found the second-hand smoke represents such miniscule doses that it is scientifically implausible that they could result in meaningful toxicological activity, to summarize one the amounts are secondhand smoke that smokers are likely to be exposed to are vanishingly small and too as such they are unlikely to be biologically important or toxicological E meaningful finally 3 the reported association between secondhand smoke and lung cancer could easily be the result of confounding given that it is such a weak Association and given the strength of other risk factors such as, diet, thus any effort to ban smoking in all workplaces and public buildings is motivated not by sound objective science but by political considerations of what constitutes correct Behavior, the government should not make this decision for the private sector or for individual Americans, received a report has been out since January of 93 why are you launching this campaign now is it because it could bills and Congress which would ban smoking in public places is it local ordinances one of the propagator campaign I think there is enough this has been a time in the last few months of overwhelming opposition to our industry a number of attacks have been made on the industry I think you, really need to look no further than the proposal that the Department of Labor and OSHA put forward in the last few months or a few weeks which takes things to such an extreme Draconian measure that clearly while we have been vocal in their opposition to the epa's handling of this and indeed are a party in a lawsuit against the EPA which is still unresolved and our dialogue has continued with the EPA and with others we felt that just the example of Osha and and other, pieces of legislation that have been floated so so clearly went beyond the wishes of the American public well into the era of prohibition and well away from what American said they want which is let us resolve our differences as we have for the last 400 years",0.8640691331999999,0.727909,0.9128387
gjhb0039,"adorable aren't they hi I'm Barbara my husband Bill thinks I'm crazy pretty nice here but I just tell him oh well the world's a crazy place and you know it's never crazier than when you were smoker take the other day I was taking a smoke break at work standing outside of course, my office building I was on the street when suddenly out of nowhere this this man runs up to me and says no smoking near that building I was shocked I mean there was two million cubic feet of air out there now I'm no radical but enough is enough I'm a smoker I like smoking I'm getting just a tad tired of people who want to make my choice their choice, it's almost like smoking has become a pain these days instead of a pleasure, but you know there is a way we smokers can free ourselves to enjoy the things we like about smoking it's this Eclipse by advantage in regular and menthol, first thing you'll notice about Eclipse you get a great taste nice draw and full-bodied satisfying smoke, but Bingo the smoke disappears about as fast as you can say thank you for not smoking and there's almost no smoke at the lid end added all of them what do you get an incredible new cigarette with super taste and nearly 90% less secondhand smoke to write on the back 90 percent that's a nice number especially when you're sharing life's journey with a nonsmoker like my husband Bill oh and check this out Eclipse leaves your curtains walls windows, does-- even your teeth a lot cleaner than other cigarettes observe, you know I've just redecorated and now with the clips is practically nothing to stay in these Priceless Treasures it's wild who would think that a cigarette could let us cut down on secondhand smoke without cutting down on satisfaction and guess what it's not just smokers like us who are crazy about it clipped people who don't smoke are raving about it too like Bill, now when we're together all that lingers in the air is my witty conversation but seriously that's what's so fabulous about eclipses there's almost no secondhand smoke almost no smoke from the live in practically no staining no lingering odor and no ashes you heard right no ashes because Eclipse doesn't burn down as we'll talk about later so now I don't need an ashtray every two feet anymore, what to do with all those extra ashtrays, stunning isn't it and now bill says all I smell like is my perfume a simple yet intriguing blend of Jasmine and free-range wildflowers now I ask you which would you rather have in your house this or this an ashtray of finished Eclipse yep that's what they look like after you've smoked them instant clean my favorite kind not that I don't underst grubbing dirty ashtrays but somehow I'll learn to do without it, before we go one step further I gotta show you this okay you already know because it has no ashes because it doesn't burn down as I mentioned so what's this Eclipse can lie flat on the table without leaving any burn marks so if your cigarette accidentally falls out of the ashtray it's less likely to burn your table carpet or your clothes well that's good news for shirts slacks sofas and car seats All Over America hmm, one thing to remember though Well there's almost no smoke at the lid and the tip is still hot so you be careful guys how does it Clips do all this let me tell you I wondered myself but actually it's simple let's go to the videotape from RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company the folks who created eclipse eclipse primarily Heats tobacco instead of burning it that's the basis for its many benefits yet it's made much like any other cigarette with a special difference at it made from high Purity carbon this tip is wrapped in, an insulating heat barrier that keeps the tobacco roll from burning down the rest of eclipse is just like other cigarettes a blend of fine tobacco followed by a regular cigarette filter, but how it's made how does it work r.j. Reynolds as you smoke your eclipse the heat barrier keeps the tobacco roll from burning down inside the cigarette instead when you draw warm air passes over the tobacco getting a just hot enough to create a full-bodied smoke that carries the flavor of the tobacco with it let's put it in English the way it flips works is something like making coffee when you pour the hot water all the flavors released, on the grounds, the ground is still there when you finish but all the flavors gone so yet tough them when you're done the guys don't trust your clip still the tips cooldown mention two clips taste rich and full-bodied but is super low in tar and nicotine no well let's hear all about it from the folks at r.j. Reynolds themselves, based on Government testing methods full flavor cigarette Styles range between 15 and 20 milligrams of tar light Styles between 6 and 14 and ultralights between 1 and 5 mg but Eclipse which primarily Heats rather than Burns tobacco is 3 milligrams in its full flavor style and to in its mild style for nicotine full flavor cigarettes typically range between point eight and one point seven milligrams of nicotine lights range between, .6 and .9 and ultralights range between point 1 and point five but eclipses nicotine level is just point to mg in its full flavor and point one and it's mild style and that's our math lesson for today seriously here's the bottom line Eclipse taste great is ultra low and tar and nicotine the smoke disappears super fast and there's a huge reduction in secondhand smoke why how it's because eclipse, poke is different from other cigarettes smoke particles from other cigarettes are about twenty percent water and glycerin put Eclipse Smoke is the reverse about 80% water and Glycerine glycerine is something found in all cigarette smoke as well as many food products and baked goods the smoke is, no sir there's almost no smoke off the lid and so no wonder there's so little secondhand smoke but is there anything in the Smoke of an eclipse that isn't in other cigarettes nope just more water and glycerin that's why all I smell are the flowers and why clip smoked a super smooth and just appear super fast just like I used to have two whenever I live cigarette, of course the real deal is Eclipse is a little different it first oh yes it is a real cigarette it's a great-tasting real cigarette it's not a cigarette alternative or any of that kind of stuff but you do sort of have to get used to it in the beginning but for me that's all part of discovering something so new and wonderful and all right then let's give it a whirl first and foremost we need a good strong flame when you light it can't use a car lighter you need a direct flame and you need to take an extra Puff, R2 when you light it that's because you lighting the carbon tip not the tobacco, now you already know Eclipse has no ashes because it doesn't burn down like your cigarette does that mean Eclipse doesn't last as long no way eclipse last just as long as my old cigarette about six or seven minutes I know I timed, another thing I discovered with the clips the best flavor comes from regular gentle pops now if you let it sit for a while the tip make all down but not to worry and extra Puffs will get it going again and when you start getting less smoke and The Taste gets weaker that's how you know your Clips is just about done, there's no question about it Eclipse really is a whole new world for us smokers now some of the great things like no ashes he discover right away others we appreciate after a while like one day maybe you take out your favorite sweater for me it's the one I was wearing when Bill proposed and guess what no cigarette odor or you walk into the house and it smells clean and fresh or you in your, are smoking a clips and you realize wow I'm smoking with the windows up I didn't even notice, here's another thing you'll discover the freedom you have when you smoke an eclipse so now I can tend to My Little Darlings without being tied to an ashtray but you know you really won't see how great it flips can be if you keep smoking your old brand so hang with the clips exclusively for a week or so and you'll see the difference, would I Barbara steer you wrong but you don't have to take my word for it listen to this okay when I first took the eclipse home I said you are not going to believe this cigarette well this is what I wanted this is exactly what I was hoping for there was just no smoke lingering in the air it was just unbelievable I took Eclipse to work and I took it down to our smokers room and the, smokers in the room were amazed with the clutch like it's know my wife's perfume or whatever she might be cooking at night I don't see you having to paint once a year the inside of your house because it's getting yellow to me is a reduction of the tar and nicotine in the cigarette is by far one of the best reasons it's more enjoyable than a regular cigarette that's the honest truth when I smoked a clipped it makes, me feel free to enjoy my cigarette without offending the non-smokers I would say would definitely be one of the only Innovative cigarettes I've ever heard of well that's the story about an incredible new cigarette called eclipse and incredible new cigarette that gives you all the pleasure of smoking without all the second-hand smoke, there's no lingering odor almost no stains no ashes and low low tar and nicotine all in a full-bodied smoke with super taste who knows with the clips maybe marriages All Over America will get better maybe it'll be the dawn of a new day of the harmony across this great land maybe chocolate will fit in your lies okay so that was a little overboard truth is it will always be, people out there who won't like that cigarette in your hand period but for the people you like the people you want to be around for you eclipse is a real step forward well I could go on and on but I don't have to aren't you lucky because you've got a fact-filled brochure that came with this video it talks about eclipses in more detail and answers the most commonly asked questions check it out it's short and informative like mate well it's time to say adios just when you thought, thought you couldn't get enough of me but hey you can always call the

gkdv0183,"this is the history of the OSHA proposed smoking ban the battle lines were drawn when the regulation was proposed in 1994 the fight is still going on today, on April 5th 1994 the Department of Labor's occupational safety and health administration OSHA proposed a virtual Nationwide ban on smoking in all indoor workplaces put simply the rule says people can't smoke where they work or work where they smoke ironically OSHA admits that 85 to 90% of American workplace has already have a smoking policy in place given that acknowledgement many business owners managers and a, Association Representatives have questioned OSHA's rationale in proposing this rule a workplace under OSHA's indoor air quality standard requires all indoor work spaces from home offices to restaurants bars hotels motels casinos bingo halls bowling alleys and manufacturing plants to have special smoking rooms under negative pressure and separately exhausted to the outside, the cost of building such rooms is estimated to be about seventy thousand dollars which is more than most businesses can afford not to mention more than most small businesses make in a year the rule is costly impractical and unnecessary it would force many businesses to ban smoking and run the risk of losing customers in response to its proposal OSHA received over 110,000 comments from individuals, the organization's business owners and employees the overwhelming majority criticized OSHA's proposed standard on September 20th 1994 OSHA open public hearings on the smoking ban proposal for address during the first two days of the hearings the public including attorneys representing the tobacco industry question do--she officials on the smoking bans purpose its economic impact and it's practical applications the officials responsible, made it clear that they had failed to consider important elements of the regulation let's suppose that my Law Firm decides to implement the standard goes into effect and has a law firm decides to have a designated smoking area and I go in there and smoke a cigarette can I read a work-related memorandum know I think that there are a number of scenarios that will come up during the course of these hearings including some that you're starting to bring up now, now and it's a bun you to bring up their number scenarios that are raised intriguing interesting important questions that we may not have thoroughly thought through from September 1994 through March 1995 over 400 individuals representing businesses trade associations and other organizations testified at the hearings against the smoking ban we believe strongly that if in fact this regulation is adopted that people will stop, coming into our taverns they will in a word stay home enjoyed tobacco products in their home and consume other forms of entertainment in their home and this is the primary motivation for us coming before you today we're talking about the loss of employment that's what we're talking about that's why we're concerned and very much concerned about the proposed OSHA ruling this proposed ruling would seriously impact my, my business my livelihood and my right to do business have been active this regulation would not only restrict the freedom of 50 million Americans who choose to smoke, it also would chip away at the freedom of every US citizen by making it illegal to discriminate against one group of people because of a lifestyle Choice the regulation would move our nation away from acceptance of diversity and back to the days of intolerance and prohibition the reason that I'm here to today is myself and our employees are both opposed to this, ban on smoking, I feel that it would hurt my business great Lakeman playing people and I'm paying a lot of taxes and I honestly think this might totally ruin my business the simple fact of the matter is the OSHA regulation is unnecessary most workplaces in the United States already have established formal smoking policies proving that employers and employees are perfectly capable of addressing the smoking issue or any workplace issue, on their own boils down to two fundamental issues it's costly and as such it will hurt business across the board the proposals impact will be far-reaching but members of the hospitality industry are especially concerned according to a study conducted for the National Restaurant Association the restaurant industry will suffer a 6.5 percent loss in sales with 18 point two billion dollars of lost sales Nationwide which could result in thousands of lost jobs, there are a lot of reasons why restaurants go out of business but government mandates and the smoking issue which is very controversial is one that we're very concerned about is that were these proposals to be put into effect they would cause some closures there they would cause some decrease in jobs another study conducted by the San Francisco hotel association shows the effects of the smoking ban on the u.s. tourism industry a loss of 3.9 billion dollars in spending by Foreign visitors, visitors to the United States a 6.8 percent decrease in foreign travel expenditures and job losses estimated at 62,000 my experience my gut feeling tells me that this proposal will be a disaster I hope that OSHA and it's officials will look into the human side of this poorly thought-out regulation and realize that the hospitality industry must satisfy all patrons it all it's paid, and they'll be out of business after the hearing is concluded on March 13th 1995 post-hearing public comment period began during this time business owners managers and other interested parties continue to speak out against the regulation also during this period the Congressional research service CRS issued a report which called into question the basis for OSHA's proposed rule that would effectively ban smoking several concerned, has cited the CRS report in criticizing OSHA's efforts to ban smoking with their CRS report we have written to OSHA to say Open Rio from the hearings and to look again at the report of the Congressional research service since their integrity is so high above reproach we feel that this is something that substantial waited what we said early on Vindicated us in our decision in objecting to what ocean was going to do on February, ninth Nineteen Ninety Six the final date of the post earring comment period the national licensed beverage Association hosted a press conference in Washington where more business owners and Community leaders spoke out against OSHA smoking ban unfortunately the OSHA indoor air quality proposed rules show that the federal government has forgotten the lessons of provision and that they have learned very little about the economics of small business we strongly believe OSHA should drop their current, proposals and focus on alternative Solutions if OSHA takes away 75% of my customer base they are in essence taking my business away from me my only means of livelihood these regulations would bankrupt me and tens of thousands of other small businesses like me across the country we're very opposed to it in Nevada because again it interferes with our relationship with our customer and our employee from the beginning of the hearings through the, the comment period OSHA was presented with 16,000 pages of recorded testimony tens of thousands of written comments and volumes of other submissions never before in the agency's history has a proposal generated public response of this magnitude now the OSHA officials are examining This Record when the evaluation is complete they could either propose a revised rule reopen the record or issue a final regulation whichever course they, I choose their decision should reflect the record and a significant negative economic implications of a one-size-fits-all approach opposition to the regulation has been loud and clear and although the current public comment period has ended the battle to keep government out of business and out of the lives of individuals is not over yet",0.8559821300000001,0.73392755,0.91283846

gkhv0183,"this is where the land stretches out forever, and were some men do what others only dream of, because this is Marlboro Country and this is Marlboro story, back in 1954 90% of the cigarettes sold in the US were filterless and Marlboro was being sold as a woman cigarette with Ivory or red beauty tips, but Philip Morris saw an opportunity to reposition Marlboro and Market filter cigarettes two men so Marlborough was reformulated with the court tip filter a stronger more flavorful blend and wrapped in a new revolutionary package the flip top box was a bold masculine eye-catching red and white design the famous Red Roof now known around the world that same year Philip Morris also chose a new advertising, agency for Marlboro here's how Joe Coleman former chairman of Philip Morris recalls that first meeting and Roger gray and then the advertising director myself got on the 20th century limited that's how we travel in those days no airplane service the 1954 we got to Chicago checked in the hotel went over the Leo Burnett and told him what our problem was he sat there mr. Leo Burnett was a formidable person by himself he was a very serious, very thoughtful personality that knew exactly how he felt about things is very positive and we tell them what we wanted to do he said were you mean you want to take a formerly woman cigarette like Marlboro there was sort of a premium price had a rose tip and advertised as mild as may you want to make it a no male cigarettes that's quite a job, here's how the late Leo Burnett described his agency's first work session what's the most masculine symbol you can think of and her off the top of his head one of these writers spoke up and said a cowboy, and there it hasn't been this quite a while but this is one of the greatest things I've ever seen I just every Instinct I had told me that this was this was it you see although the very first ad showed a cowboy the campaign featured many different kinds of men they were strong and masculine worked at interesting action-filled occupations and more tattoos that hinted at romantic pasts, this new strategy began to work and work well sales volume nearly tripled within just one year by 1962 the decision was made that rather than a variety of strong masculine types a singular Marlboro Man would work even better, the solution was found in the American Cowboy, the next year he was given a home Marlboro Country here's how the evolution of that campaign was described by a former president of Philip Morris Jack Landry Marlboro advertising from its Inception in 1954 has consistently developed and grown from our original concept, this was the next refinement in our advertising to put the cowboy in his world today's West and when we did he became a more believable symbol of masculinity the rugged dramatic beauty of his world allowed him to also become a more visual symbol and in visual terms he was at his strongest you campaign have been as single-minded and purpose and as unique and fresh in execution, we were the first to use real men in our advertising instead of professional model type this changed the whole advertising business not just cigarette advertising the non model model became fashionable, as the Marlboro Country campaign continued it gained even more momentum throughout the 60s becoming by 1972 the best-selling cigarette in the world Marlboro is now marketed in over 150 Nations and territories a success aided by the campaign's ability to travel well across borders domestically and abroad the campaign's ability to take advantage of changing tastes and, Odes among smokers has also played a key role in the Brand's future successes when we came into a period of over where we sort of stabilized on a certain level because people with become very interested in tar nicotine content cigarette one of the thoughts was that we ought to talk about the tar and nicotine content of Bravo sat down and said Jack we got to do something about the we got to bring out a Marlboro line extension of Marlborough miles and what I recommend he said Joe would you, mind if you go to Marlboro Lights with the introduction of Marlboro Lights Philip Morris expanded the definition of the Brand's character by using familiar similar themes the roof the Cowboy and the country over the years Marlboro continued to use LINE extensions to support an address changes in consumers tastes and attitudes creating no news for the brand and fueling its growth, in the late 80s however the market began changing leading to price promotion from many brand name products across many categories and marburo began to see heightened competition from the Discount Cigarette segment, Marlboro responded to these pressures by adjusting the value equation while keeping the Marlboro Country campaign going strong Marlboro also took pricing actions while at the same time leading A Renewed investment in retail visibility and mega consumer promotions, Marlboro racing proved that the Marlboro concept successfully extended in other equities consistent with the theme of heroic masculinity but in 1990 marburo took racing to new heights when marburo Team Penske began competing on the IndyCar track creating excitement for the brand by becoming one of the most recognized and successful teams in the series, next came the launch of the single biggest consumer promotion of all time the Marlboro Adventure team, millions of smokers entered a contest to join the adventure team in a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Marlboro Country and an overwhelming number of consumers save miles from Pax to get free Marlboro Adventure team gear, the success of this program led to another the Marlboro Country Store which again gave consumers the opportunity to own a piece of Marlboro Country by collecting miles to get more gear in 1996 Marlboro will introduce to Consumers the most exciting promotion yet the Marlboro Unlimited it's a third of a mile long state-of-the-art train built, exclusively for Marlboro smokers 2000 winners and their guests will spend five days and nights on board with scheduled stops to take on everything a land Without Limits as to offer and right along with it Marlboro will roll out an entire new line of gear, I look at Marlboro share the US market shows that the result of this ongoing value-added strategy has been tremendous and has left Marlboro well positioned for growth, and to look at total worldwide sales shows that Marlboro sales have steadily increased year after year and now exceed 398 billion and volume continues to grow, this then is the Marlboro story a single idea born in 1954 then evolved and expanded into the most successful and recognizable campaign in history an idea that's kept the brand alive vital and aspirational while remaining compelling and relevant through the years like the land that stretches as far as you can see, Marlboro continues to do what others only dream of",0.8683989621428573,0.738274,0.91283834

glhb0039,"from New York Forrest Sawyer over the past several months day one has reported on the tobacco industry and the health effects of cigarette smoking including a report on the manipulation of levels of nicotine in cigarettes the Food and Drug Administration has suggested it may be necessary to regulate cigarettes as a drug and Congress has begun hearings to debate the issue, now there is an extraordinary new development in the fight over cigarettes an unparalleled opportunity to examine the inner thoughts of one member of the tobacco industry documents have surfaced thousands of pages from a cigarette company called Brown & Williamson and its parent company the British American tobacco company called v80 are the makers of Viceroy cool and Raleigh Cigarettes the documents are internal Communications dating all the way back to the 1950s and they show how much the company's, about the harmful effects of cigarettes and how they responded to the growing Health crisis these documents may be the most significant disclosure of internal tobacco industry documents in the last 50 years how did the tobacco industry for all these years since people knew smoking caused lung cancer how did they survive how did they beat back the political pressures that were brought against them how did they intimidate the Health Community how did they keep the Health Community from taking meaningful action to control the Lynn to me, it's a fascinating story cigarettes, this Story begins in the 1950s when America was booming and cigarettes were an integral part of life the ads were everywhere and smoking meant fun but even back then they were concerns that smoking could be linked to cancer and the tobacco companies made a dramatic move to ease the Public's concerns issuing what they called a Frank statement that said we accept an interest in people's Health as, a basic responsibility but this was a sensitive subject the documents show that by 1957 some baat researchers were using the codename Zephyr apparently a reference to cancer one document repeatedly used the codename noting the idea has arisen that there is a causal relationship between Zephyr and tobacco smoking the documents do not explain whether code name was used in the first place, this is a way to hide this from yourself if you can make a game of it and say Zephyr is alleged to be caused by smoking and these dr. John Slade is an anti-smoking Advocate who studies the effects of smoking it's a little more comfortable perhaps to be talking about that in sort of play language than to be talking about cancer, in Congressional hearings just this past April Tobacco Company Executives continued to express cautions when asked about the findings of outside medical researchers this was one view they agree that smoking causes lung cancer do you agree it may do you know whether it does I do not know the documents raised questions about the public pronouncements of tobacco company Executives in 1962 v80 executive ad McCormick told a meeting of researchers from four continents quote, you were in much to responsible opposition to get up and say I accept that the product which we and our competitors are putting on the market gives you lung cancer whatever you might think privately it brings into serious question every statement they have made about addiction and health over the last 30 years attorney Matthew Myers who has been shown the documents represents a coalition of anti-smoking groups they should have told them the truth they should have told them what they knew by 1960, on it appears some Brown & Williamson researchers were debating how to deal with emerging evidence of a relationship between Cancer and tobacco a memo quoting the company's research director says scientists with whom I talked were unanimous in their opinion that smoke is weekly carcinogenic under certain conditions another document refers to animal studies showing that in sufficient doses tobacco condensate acts as a carcinogen the documents show that some Executives did argue, you for research that would lead to safer cigarettes even forming a less hazardous cigarettes committee they lost the debate and the safer cigarette was abandoned dr. Dietrich Hoffman a tobacco scientist at the American Health Foundation Samoans it would have fought some less harmful to you it less toxic see at on the market they would have admitted such a secret as toxic as carcinogenic it was also considerable research on the effects of nicotine, substance that is causing so much controversy today there were studies codenamed Mad Hatter and hippo and there was some plain talk about addiction in 1963 Addison yeaman general counsel at Brown & Williamson wrote We are then in the business of selling nicotine an addictive drug effective in the release of stress mechanisms to researchers wrote that same year unlike other dopings such as morphine the demand for increasing dose levels is relatively slow for nicotine, teen they also wrote in a chronic smoker the normal equilibrium can be maintained only by continuous nicotine intake this unconscious desire explains the addiction of the individual to nicotine, they're open acceptance of the fact that it was addicting, indicates to me that that they looked on that as a desirable property as something that helped keep their customers buying product the relaxing affects the stimulating effects the weight loss effects were seen as advantages that could be balanced against the disease causing effects yes it causes lung cancer but it also helps you control your weight, by the 1970s the tobacco industry had responded to Growing public concerns about smoking by offering a new kind of cigarette one low in tar and nicotine but early research suggested a cigarette would not really reduce nicotine intake the documents refer to a study which says the smoker adjusts his pattern to deliver his own nicotine requirements in other words he keeps smoking until his desire for nicotine is satisfied the documents also show strategies for dealing with, Ali damaging information research was to be done by an outside organization the council for tobacco research a 1978 memorandum says it is better to have someone else doing the research quote which if it goes wrong can become the smoking pistol in a lawsuit a 1979 memo recommends placing potentially damaging research under attorney-client privilege so anyone suing the company could not have access to it a full 40 years, after the tobacco companies issued their Frank statement to the American people Executives continue to hold a position that is now disputed by almost the entire scientific Community I believe nicotine is not addictive, I believe that nicotine is not addictive I believe nicotine is not addictive we now have 40 Years of evidence of cover-up of the assembling of a refusal to confront the major problems their products cause the Dogma continues the pretense continues that smoking isn't a cause of disease, Brown & Williamson has said it believes documents similar to the ones obtained by day one we're stolen from its law firms offices in violation of attorney-client privilege the papers do appear to be widely distributed now other news organizations have quoted from similar documents the house subcommittee on health and the environment has received a set and day one obtained its documents from a university Professor who told us he received an unsolicited Anonymous package filled with the papers legal wrangling is already begun the house subcommittee wants, it's brown and Williamson to testify at a hearing and the company says it is obtained a court order compelling various news organizations and even the subcommittee itself to show them the documents they've received late this afternoon Brown & Williamson sent us a news release saying that today it had made public quote studies that correct erroneous reports about nicotine research attributed to the company and that quote do not conclude that nicotine is addicting we should point out that we have not seen those studies Brown & Williamson is, rise to Brennan Dawson at the tobacco Institute to speak on its behalf and she is with us live in our Washington Bureau Miss Dawson you see how Fascinating People find these documents to be are there any circumstances in which Brown & Williamson would consider simply releasing them for public scrutiny well in fact what Brown & Williamson did today in which you just referred to is they at release the actual studies that seem to be being talked about in media reports what they don't know and what they've had to reluctantly go to court to try to find out is what, comments are being sent through the mail me what documents were stolen are they in fact company documents this is exactly the kind of problem that that the whole tobacco industry is faced with right now it's faced with the situation that is full of innuendo that's full of charges being selectively pulled out and then spread widely and what we're asking for is a Level Playing Field in this case Brown & Williamson asking mr. Waxman and the subcommittee let's just take a look at what documents you want us to answer questions about in the, time here are the actual studies that's people seem to be talking about that in fact do not conclude that nicotine is addicting of course what your critics are concerned about is you might be selectively releasing certain kinds of materials and there are these documents that are already out in the public Arena so the question is would Brown & Williamson consider allowing those documents then to go to public scrutiny well that's a decision that Brown & Williamson in conjunction with a court order prohibiting them to do just that we'll have to decide but in the meantime, isn't it only fair that critics of the industry again selecting portions of documents that people don't know where they came from so they can't even authenticate them should be able to review them in order to respond all right you want to look at what the doctor time the tobacco industry today Brown & Williamson releasing the original studies of several weeks ago the manufacturers joining to release the list of ingredients in cigarettes on a voluntary basis I mean this is the kind of information that we believe should continue to be forthcoming but these, these I'm sorry that I have some speculation I'm very sorry about the time I thank you very much for joining us Branden Dawson with the tobacco Institute Henry Waxman is the congressman with the house subcommittee on health and the environment sir put these documents in perspective are they important to you I think what we've got to put in perspective is the fact that the tobacco industry has operated in secret for decades and the public and the Congress have been kept from the information about what they have known about the health impacts of, of cigarettes and the nicotine Addiction in smoking it seems to me that our job is to be responsible to the public to get this information we're going to do it in a fair way we're going to do it in a responsible manner but I don't think the tobacco industry ought to ask for special treatment we're going to give them fair treatment well what they are saying is perhaps you're not being fair perhaps these documents were actually stolen from their law offices and that they are under attorney-client privilege and they only have asked the right to be able to review whether these, documented where in fact purloined we've heard from Brown & Williamson's attorney and they asked for a delay on the hearing we had scheduled for tomorrow we've given them that delay we've also told them that we're not going to question them on any documents except those which they give to the subcommittee and of they have promised us documents and we're yet to receive them we're going to question them about news reports which I think they ought to have an opportunity to be able to respond to and I think a congressional form is an appropriate place for them, to tell us to put things into context and to get us to understand what is being said that isn't accurate we are told that you have been handed a court order from a Kentucky judge who says that you should turn over those documents so that Brown & Williamson can review them and determine if they were stolen will you comply you know the tobacco industry can hire the best lawyers the bets public relations people they have a high economic interest in trying to keep the public from knowing the truth about a cigarette smoking, going to be fair to them but we're not going to be intimidated by them either Congressman the question of course is whether you'll let them look at them well we're talking to our house counsel to see whether that's an appropriate action for us to take and they've told us that it would be an extraordinary action to have them go through the files of a subcommittee of the Congress of the United States wall and investigation is going on we won't ask them questions about any documents at the hearing we have scheduled except those, is which they give to us and those that have been reported on in the public domain and I think they ought to have a chance to give their side of the story and we will give them that opportunity there is so much fighting going on over these documents and there's certain to be legal wrangling going on in the future why are these papers so important, you know the news reports about these papers indicate that perhaps the tobacco industry has known for a long time information that they deny even to today about the health impacts of cigarette smoking and the addiction from the nicotine in smoking I think we've got to find out what they have known and get that information out to the public and not let them hide all this information as they've been able to do for decades, they've been able to obfuscate Miss Dawson very quickly if you would your response well first of all the studies again that have been widely speculated upon in the media were made public today so I hope that mr. Waxman has an opportunity to review them and I hope he provides the companies an opportunity to review those documents that have been stolen that may not be there as before he asked them to be questioned Miss Dawson and Congressman Waxman I thank you both very much for joining us will be following the story and we will be right back, still to come on day one she defied her own son",0.8598093067647058,0.70612377,0.9128394
glpj0015,"adorable aren't they hi I'm Barbara my husband Bill thinks I'm crazy putting these here but I just tell him oh well the world's a crazy place and you know it's never crazier than when you were smoker take the other day I was taking a smoke break at work standing outside of course my, office building I was on the street when suddenly out of nowhere this this man runs up to me and says I mean there was two million cubic feet of air up there now I'm no radical but enough is enough I'm a smoker I like smoking and I'm getting just a tad tired of people who want to make my choice their choice it's almost like smokings become, paying these days instead of a pleasure, but you know there is a way we smokers can free ourselves to enjoy the things we like about smoking, it's this Eclipse by Vantage in regular and menthol, first thing you'll notice about eclipses you get a great taste nice draw and full-bodied satisfying smoke but Bingo the smoke disappears about as fast as you can say thank you for not smoking and there's almost no smoke at the lid end add it all up and what do you get an incredible new cigarette with super taste and 90% less secondhand smoke it's right on the back 90% less secondhand smoke, a nice number especially when you're sharing life's journey with a nonsmoker like my husband Bill oh and check this out Eclipse leaves your curtains walls Windows even your teeth a lot cleaner than other cigarettes observe, you know I've just redecorated and now with the clips is practically nothing to stain these Priceless Treasures, it's wild who would think that a cigarette could let us cut down on secondhand smoke without cutting down on satisfaction and guess what it's not just smokers like us who are crazy about eclipses people who don't smoke are raving about it too like Bill, now when we're together all that lingers in the air is my witty conversation but seriously that's what's so fabulous about eclipses there's almost no secondhand smoke almost no smoke from the lid end practically no staining no lingering odor and no ashes you heard right no ashes because Eclipse doesn't burn down as we'll talk about later so now I don't need an ashtray every two feet anymore, what to do with all those extra ashtrays, stunning isn't it and now bill says all I smell like is my perfume a simple yet intriguing blend of Jasmine and free-range wildflowers now I ask you which would you rather have in your house this or this an ashtray of finished Eclipse yep that's what they look like after you've smoked them, instant clean my favorite kind not that I don't understand rubbing dirty ashtrays but somehow I'll learn to you without it, before we go one step further I gotta show you this okay you already know Eclipse has no ashes because it doesn't burn down as I mentioned so watch this Eclipse can lie flat on the table without leaving burn marks so if your cigarette accidentally falls out of the ashtray it's less likely to burn the table carpet or your clothes now that's good news for shirts slacks sofas and car seats All Over America hmm one thing to remember though, Well there's almost no smoke at the lid and the tip is still hot so do be careful guys how does it Clips do all this let me tell you I wondered myself but actually it's simple let's go to the videotape from RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company the folks who created eclipse, eclipse primarily Heats tobacco instead of burning it that's the basis for its many benefits yet it's made much like any other cigarette with a special difference at it may from high-purity carbon this tip is wrapped in an insulating heat barrier that keeps the tobacco roll from burning down the rest of eclipse is just like other cigarettes a blend of fine tobacco followed by a regular cigarette filter that's how it's made, that is it work r.j. Reynolds as you smoke your eclipse the heat barrier keeps the tobacco roll from burning down inside the cigarette instead when you draw warm air passes over the tobacco getting a just hot enough to create a full-bodied smoke that carries the flavor of the tobacco with it let's put it in English the way Eclipse works is something like making coffee when you pour the hot water, all the flavors release from the grounds the grounds are still there when you finish but all the flavors gone so yeah toss them when you're done but guys don't toss your Clips to the tips cooldown do I mention Eclipse taste rich and full-bodied but it's super low in tar and nicotine no well let's hear all about it from the folks at r.j. Reynolds themselves, based on Government testing methods full flavor cigarette Styles range between 14 and 20 milligrams of tar light Styles between 7 and 13 and ultralights between one and six milligrams but Eclipse which primarily Heats rather than Burns tobacco is three milligrams in its full flavor style and to and it's mild style for nicotine full flavor cigarettes typically range between point eight and one point seven milligrams of nicotine, lights range between .6 and .9 and ultralights range between point 1 and point five but eclipses nicotine level is just point to mg in its full flavor and point one and it's mild Style, and that's our math lesson for today seriously here's the bottom line Eclipse taste great is ultra low and tar and nicotine the smoke disappears super fast and there's 90 percent less secondhand smoke why how because a clip smoke is different than other cigarettes, smoke particles from other cigarettes are about twenty percent water and glycerin but a clip smoke is the reverse about 85% water and Glycerine glycerine is something found in all cigarette smoke as well as many food products and baked goods the smoke is mostly water and glycerin there's almost no smoke off the lid and so no wonder these 90% less secondhand smoke but is there anything in the Smoke of an eclipse that you would find in other cigarettes nope just more water and glycerin that's why all, all I smell the flowers that's why it clip smoked taste super smooth and disappears super fast just like I used to have two whenever I lit a cigarette, of course the real deal is Eclipse is a little different at first oh yes it is a real cigarette it's a great-tasting real cigarette it's not a cigarette alternative or any of that kind of stuff but you do sort of have to get used to it in the beginning but for me that's all part of discovering something so new and wonderful all right then let's give it a whirl first and foremost you need a good strong flame when you light an eclipse get use a car lighter you need a direct flame and you need to take an extra, a group of 42 when you light it that's because you're lighting the carbon tip not the tobacco, now you already know Eclipse has no ashes because it doesn't burn down like your cigarette does that mean Eclipse doesn't last as long no way eclipse last just as long as my old cigarette about six or seven minutes I know I timed it, another thing I discovered with the clips the best flavor comes from regular gentle Puffs now if you let it sit for a while the tip May cool down but not to worry and extra Puffs will get it going again and when you start getting less smoke and The Taste gets weaker, well that's how you know your Clips is just about done, there's no question about it Eclipse really is a whole new world for us smokers now some of the great things like no ashes you discover right away others you appreciate after a while like one day maybe you take out your favorite sweater for me it's the one I was wearing when Bill proposed and guess what no cigarette odor or you walk into the house and it smells clean and fresh or you're in your car smoking a clip to you realize, wow I'm smoking with the windows up I didn't even notice, here's another thing you'll discover the freedom you have when you smoke an eclipse so now I can tend to My Little Darlings without being tied to an ashtray but you know you really won't see how great a Clips can be if you keep smoking your old brand so hang with the clips exclusively for a week or so and you'll see the difference, would I Barbara steer you wrong but you don't have to take my word for it listen to this my first took the eclipse home I said you are not going to believe this cigarette wow this is what I wanted this is exactly what I was hoping for it tastes wonderful I took equips to work and I took it down to our smokers room and the other smokers in the room were amazed there was just no smoke lingers, hang in there it was just unbelievable you don't get the tobacco smell in your clothes we like the idea that the windows didn't get fogged up and in the car especially because that can get a little nasty I don't see you having to paint once a year the inside of your house because it's getting yellow to me is reduction of the tar and nicotine in the cigarette is by far one of the best reasons they serve, piety I mean if you're a light smoker there's lights I'm a menthol smoker and there was full flavor and lights there was also the regular I Believe full flavor and lights so they're definitely choices it's more enjoyable than a regular cigarette that's the honest truth when I smoked a Clips it makes me feel free to enjoy my cigarette without offending the non-smokers I would say it would definitely be one of the only Innovative cigarettes I, I've ever heard of well that's the story about an incredible new cigarette called eclipse and incredible new cigarette that gives you all the pleasure of smoking with 90% less secondhand smoke, there's no lingering odor almost no stains no ashes and low low tar and nicotine all in a full-bodied smoke with super taste who knows with Eclipse maybe marriages All Over America will get better maybe, it will be the dawn of a new day of Harmony across this great land maybe chocolate will spend your life okay so that was a little overboard truth is there will always be people out there who won't like that cigarette in your hand period but for the people you like the people you want to be around for you eclipse is a real step forward well I could go on and on but I don't have to aren't you lucky, because you've got a fact-filled brochure that came with this video it gives answers to the most commonly asked questions people have about a Clips but better yet why not try it for free and ask the folks who make it your own questions it's called and a clip sneak preview they're all over town and they're fun you'll meet other adult smokers and it shorts and entertaining like me and don't worry about obligations there aren't any you won't be asked to buy a thing in fact you'll, get a free carton of cigarettes in regular or Menthol Jeff for coming you could even bring along a friend who smokes just call one eight hundred seventy eight seventy eight seventy eight to try it right now or fill out the enclose card and hey tell him Barber sent you you'll get quicker service, surgeon general's warning quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your help",0.858259666,0.74607986,0.9128387
gmpj0015,"huh,finished with our annual meeting for this year, obviously I'm very pleased with the result of the voting as you all know now on very preliminary vote counts the bulb Brooks late was defeated in I'm not a political expert but from my point of view it's a landslide, I think it's the vote was well from what I understand it was at least three or three and a half times 21 against le beau and my guess is that if you took out his and icon shares is vote as Tiny indeed probably my guess is 821 or maybe even ten to one against his slate so what I see in this is that our, shareholders were listening to what we had to say and our shareholders understood that we were listening to them and that's the important thing because what I think our shareholders recognize is this is a fantastic company with great Brands tremendous Brands internationally and domestically both in the tobacco side and the food side they see the value in the company and they want their management to get back to work and get performance out of this company and that's, it's what we're going to do now that this distraction is behind us so with that said it's just that simple really let me take some questions, yes sir, a spin-off is something that is going to stay a front-burner issue for our board it's an important priority for us but the key thing is we're not going to do something to injure the whole company in trying to do something that today would be unwise more importantly for us right now is to concentrate on our businesses 1995 and the last part of the year we started to get good performance out of our Reynolds tobacco, Echo company which is located here in Winston-Salem we're going to have a terrific year in our tobacco business in 1996 Reynolds tobacco here in Winston-Salem is going to do well and our international business is going to be performing in double digits in 1996 now we're just going to have to let events unfold,I think our shareholders have really had a full analysis on the spin-off they've been through this they've been listening to it now for eight months as you're aware our shareholders not only resoundingly rejected messrs icon and labo but they also rejected the shareholder proposal on a spin-off and what they're telling us is very clear get the value for us that's, Aunt in the wonderful Brands you have at Reynolds tobacco and at Nabisco and that's what they want us to do now and that's what our management is going to focus on yes sir, yes I think what our tobacco company has said publicly and I think what Philip Morris and the others have said is is we're not going to settle those cases we're confident we're going to Prevail in those cases and that's how we feel right now my own view is I wasn't at the castano hearings but I read in the Wall Street Journal and the other papers what you all have read and I think that tobacco industry's defenses are very strong there, he said this year was going to be a very strong year for earnings which ended current while speaking census figures are too low, now I think I think we are job this year is to meet Wall Street expectations and we expect to do that and we also expect to be investing in our tobacco business and in Nabisco now that our balance sheet has been strengthened and that's what I talked about at the annual meeting today how important 1995 was again keep in mind this is a company that had 30 billion dollars of debt just a few years ago and now on an RN Standalone basis we've got that balance sheet down, down to where our debt is completely manageable and we can now focus on strengthening our businesses that's what 1996 is going to be yes sir, well I think you can look right now at Reynolds tobacco and see the job that they're doing with their full share Brands and see that they are on the way back I don't know if any of you saw the in the other day in the Wall Street Journal the article on our new red camel and our leverage how we're leveraging our camel Brands I think the company is doing an excellent job there you've seen the articles about eclipses are Reynolds tobacco company today is a company with a commitment to grow its, it's got new ideas Behind These great Brands and I think we're going to see performance out of Reynolds in 1996 yes, well I can tell you that I have been very much in the business of speaking the Lord shareholders since I've been CEO of this company and I have not heard from mr. LeBeau where mr. icon but I'd speak to any shareholder this company and that's really about all I can say at the moment the only thing I can say about that is, I have no idea what mr. LeBeau is going to do the only thing I know is I've got a mandate from our shareholders to improve the performance of RJR Nabisco and that's what I'm going to do as far as mr. LeBeau is concerned he's going to have to figure that one out for himself now my guess is the resolution was, not defeated as soundly as mr. LeBeau and mr. Icahn were on the other hand our shareholders and the shareholders to whom I've spoken one us to do the best we can to find the right opportunity to spin off the Pisco now my own view is that will come in the reasonably near future but what's critical and I think what our shareholders expect management to do in a board of directors to do is not to wreck the company trying to, do a spin-off first operate the company get the values that are inherent in that company for your shareholders and if you can spin off in the Pisco if you find the right time then go ahead and do it and keep in mind we've separated those companies the viscose got it separate balance sheet now it's in a position to be spun off when the right time is there we'll find the right time that's what I understand yes, no I don't not at this point I only thing I was told really was nothing more than what Mike Harper said to our meeting which is that it did not command a majority of those voting and therefore Was Defeated I don't know what the vote was,I've talked to remember I've talked to quite a lot of our shareholders about why they voted in the consent solicitation and people even though it was a non-binding resolution on a particular issue people had a lot of reasons for voting in that consent solicitation they really some of them voted because they wanted to send us a message that they wanted us to get earnings up at RJR Nabisco as soon as we can others said they wanted increase dividends others said they wanted us to spin off as soon as we could, good and there's a kind of a mixed message there I'll tell you something I myself believe that if we can do it at the right time we should separate these businesses so I share that same view with a lot of our shareholders but what the majority of our shareholders are saying today is they're not going to risk our company to trying to do a spin off at the wrong time, I personally blame him for every darn Penny of it, contingency made in the event of justice department action against tobacco vision, the tobacco company is been well represented in all of these matters they've got terrific counsel I think they've got a very good handle on the kinds of issues they're facing and I don't know whether you call them contingency plans or not but I think they've got all of those issues very well in hand okay well let's take one more question if you have it, I think the fact that we got an opportunity to talk to our shareholders the whole process we've been through has given us a good sense of what they want and you can't always do everything immediately for your shareholders but I have gotten a good sense that they felt the cash power generating power the company is so strong that we ought to try to do more in dividends and frankly that's what we've done okay thank you very much, Jim Johnston good morning everyone let me just briefly say how much I appreciate the tremendous support of our 10,000 employees here in Winston-Salem many of whom, volunteered their time to man the telephones to call shareholders employees shareholders retiree shareholders and shareholders all over the country to help win this Battle Force this little no labo sticker was something our employees thought of and passed around the company we've had tremendous support from the local community from all the people in the brokerage firms to people who care, care about this company and we deeply appreciate the support of all those people and we will do our best to build a great future for this company yes yes, about job, we have an a company-wide bonus system which allows for special bonuses for every single employee in the company when we have a Good Year everyone has a good year over and above their regular pay and benefits are pay and benefits are among the highest in the country period we work hard, hard to to save every job we can in this company every company in this industry everyone has downsized over the last decade the way we keep our jobs is we sell more cigarettes we make better cigarettes and we Market them better that's how we all keep our jobs no Union what what in the hell did the Union do for Liggett & Myers, I certainly hope so,mr.

Reynolds it's all of the the forces working together we talked today about our support the law program we've had that independently studied by the University of Colorado we did a pilot program in Denver I mentioned that we were able to reduce youth access by fifty percent are right decisions, now program is in over 110 cities reaching three and a half million students a year fully endorsed by the school boards in the principles they wouldn't keep using this program if they didn't think it helped is that enough no we need to have fundamentally tighter enforcement we support that we've got a major program going on in cooperation with the National Association of convenience stores and the food marketing, titute for training for signage and making sure that clerks behind the counter asked for ID that's a single most important thing we can do, yes sir earlier the company had said that they were going to reduce the amount of Joe Camel and and ads in the area so far we haven't seen that a lot of people outside the company has not ever made that statement company has never made a mistake someone made that statement at the meeting today but we've never made that statement we use a variety of programs to Market camel and are other brands we do not, is Joe Camel exclusively we rotate to other other creative forms periodically it's an amazing that might Target younger folks because it's a cartoon character well we have as you know may know this was studied by the Federal Trade Commission we supplied every single camel document we have 60,000 Pages they worked on it for three years and they concluded that, there is no evidence that this campaign encourages young people to smoke., I do not my testimony is a matter of public record I have reviewed every word of my testimony I would not change a word what I would do was maybe be a little more vocal when I was repeatedly cut off in my answers or when questions were answered for me if you go back and look at the transcript or look at the video you will find out that a I was asked the question, shouldn't I cigarettes addictive I started an explanation first a definition I was cut off and Congressman Wyden said I'll take that as a no and that was typical of the behavior of that committee all day I went there to tell the truth and the whole truth and nothing but and I knew there were some folks who wouldn't listen there, but if there were only five people in the audience are on TV who watched it I wanted them to hear and I strove to do that all day long, how would I know that two weeks later we did a survey 45 percent of all Americans said they had seen part or all of those hearings I had over 1,000 letters and phone calls from smokers and non-smokers and I had maybe two of those 1,000 were - one last question yes sir, litigation and playing will it ever end it's now it's been a decade yes you might be given immunity from lawsuits tobacco lawsuit in exchange for something FDA oversight FDA regulation this industry haven't foreseen the possibility that that might happen when you support that well that that's a very hypothetical question our posture is we, we have strong defenses against every one of those suits we firmly believe we will prevail in court I do see in a broader sense it's not limited to litigation but there has to be some kind of reconciliation in this country that accepts that adults can make the choice to smoke and that we all are unified in keeping cigarettes away from kids, and if we can begin to create joint Solutions on those I'm not opposed to regulation provided that regulations purpose isn't to prohibit our product we work Germany's a perfect example we are regulated in Germany we have a great working relationship with the German regulatory Authority but in this case you read what the FDA proposes and it's not about kids that's a guys, bye, I can't say so many a proposal I've you know I'd look at anything but our focus is winning this litigation and we believe we will thanks very much",0.8307563546153844,0.37629968,0.91283864

okay yeah the fact is there's a lot of water and glycerin will write correct okay what what were you what were before you got to try it again okay this is you got to kind of go back to when you're just learning about what type of things were you thinking oh my God they're going to kill me they're gonna push on the poison poison, to me that's why I really thought yeah okay so you were kind of skeptical yes I was very skeptical yes okay I wonder what is the like me of all the people and just a phone call I didn't believe it when I first spoke to the person over the phone but then after I came out here and I saw the many people here hey guy living more relaxed and then when I saw that cigarette and I saw the charcoal filter at the tip so you know what we think of what it was it the charcoal filter that was that's what it was yes, you thinking about that going to try to cover monoxide yeah that was a quiet yeah Carmen is all right did you ever get an answer to that question no I did not I never asked a question okay well as soon as they get done filming I'll explain it to you okay it's actually got about the carbon monoxide of about a light cigarette so it's you know less than a full flavor what kind of cigarette we smelt a full-flavored menthol yeah so that has Co that's higher than what eclipse, has or carbon monoxide just like the answer your question yeah what watch watch my hands okay sorry about that let's go so at first you were kind of skeptical what was it like when you first did you try here and you get to bring it home and try it I took it home and try it and we'll show my neighbors okay what was your first reaction when you first lit one up and try it but hard to pull, and I did see then as I smoked it The Taste is nice you know it was Miles smooth and it was like are to me okay was The Taste satisfying very in what how would you explain like it was it and fall okay let's say I was your friend and I see you smoking is a hat looks strange you know how would you say but I bet it doesn't taste good how would you explain the taste and taste was up Mi it wasn't hard it wasn't harsh, it was a smooth it was a menthol taste and I didn't take the - teen taste yeah okay so you'll end up liking the taste okay sorry about that hanging here like when airplanes and stuff go over what when you okay now that you took it home who is the first person that you got to show it to my children okay what was their reaction my daughter liked it because it is, leaving smoke or odor in the air or smell bad smell rather my son was skeptical too you know he liked it he tasted it and it was all right okay what now that after you got the smoke let's say I hoped I wouldn't be would you get your hands on okay scared of that huh, when you act you smoke like let's say a pack all right you finish your first pack, how do you sum up in a word I mean what's what word comes to mind what is it like after it's a smoker for the first time smokes a whole pack of the cliffs, what was that like yeah what do you think they're going to feel are they going to feel disappointed or do not like is this nice it really is I like okay I really do like I think it'd be good for people is traveling on the plains how do you go for people in restaurants so you want to hear about the second hand smoke yeah okay well that's interesting in the restaurants what what do you mean by that well you know there's certain areas in the restaurant where you can smoke or certain areas in them, business where you can smoke some and hospitals to some say you're not allowed to smoke in hospitals period with the cigarettes you can, okay did you show it to any other smokers call yes I have tell me about some stories there what it was like and was mile or in part was they had a real problem with was pulling on it had to be Guinea after that and that was it I am one person to say I don't feel anything you know so that's one element many okay what would do you remember any one in particular that liked it, yes what type of things were they interested in it was to be with one of the guys the job the head chef he really liked it he said let him know when the next test will be done for the regular because he's not into the Menthol and it was a guy that try yesterday he really liked it food taste is amazing pie didn't leave any ashes and then leaving spoken are you like this is like to taste okay the the first guy that you were talking about the try and he wanted to know, when they're going to be on the market yes what do you think do you have any idea what was important to him or what do you like he was amazed he was amazed at the no smoke in the air no cigarette ashes he was amazed about, the taste you know the smoothness of it yeah okay what um what were you were normally talk to me for a second about you were smoking full flavor and what full flavor Menthol I think you were saying come on Montclair now what's what styles and flavors do you like in Eclipse I like I say I like the smoothness of it I like because it doesn't leave any odor in the air or on your clothes on your body, like because without this is just a easy smoke is real tight like that the pools hard First beginning well there is one point when you get to smoking on it almost at the end it burns your finger so it gets real hot yes it does okay are you smoking Eclipse full flavor or Clips miles for flavor okay now do at work are you allowed to smoke, Miss Hale okay so you can smoke regular cigarettes or anything at work here okay does anyone else smoke it you were quite a few people okay words you have you told me about those people or did those people get to see the cigarette with only three people saw their head chef one of the managers and one of the workers and you told me about the head chef did you tell me about the other two yet because they haven't tasted yet it didn't have the time but then we'll try it okay, so they thought the idea was interesting oh yeah how would let's say I smoked you and I smoke - Claire okay and we're best friends how would you compare it to Montclair, no because you taste that tired - that's what you'll taste in in mind Claire but in this Eclipse you don't what will it taste like we are explaining my okay specifically about the cigarette has 90% less secondhand smoke is that something that's important to you or here is very important my daughter doesn't smoke and I think that's unfair who smoke in the house and was smoking around hard as she can get sick, just by I smoke and I don't want that to happen, so it's very important because I heard it secondhand smoke is worse then the person is actually smoking a cigarette okay with what do you what do you think other non smokers would say about this cigarette as it deals with the fact that it has you know all the lot less secondhand smoke what's our reaction going to I think they appreciate it I mean if you want smoking that's your business but don't don't let it affect me you know since I don't smoke and say if I stop, smoking and I wouldn't want to know that smoke around me so that's why it's important for a second a smoker okay have you did you know how long did it take you to notice that this thing didn't have an ash that day the first day and I still have asked right beside me what thumping at it yeah and is that something you're going to miss, I might enjoy that not having Ash's because I can't stand my ashes fall on the floor and like you know children me my I have a son at this that's a girl is long and I can't stand that so it's important okay what what so you have the ashes that are fallen on the floor with a normal cigarette right did you notice anything different when you are smoking and eclipse is a deals with ashes I mean what did you change your behavior anyone you're slow, I liked it it was amazing and I guess that's what a little trouble isn't for the charcoal yeah okay do you think you're going to our have did you notice the talk to me for a second not like the odor of a cigarette and what how eclipse is going to address that for you okay to owner is is a very strong odor for a normal cigarette sometimes feel like herbs and which I don't smoke ruthless, sorry for that earlier okay but it doesn't can you know people get out I say out can get it cost caught up like that I think they do you smoke some reefer no it's not like that it's just a regular cigarette and, and it stinks if I'm like some time I try to stop smoking and my son son still be smoking cessation will get us a room away from me you know because it smells and so it helps in an order where the eclipse won't be having an order strong order like that and go all through your house owner you smell someone smoking in the house okay what about like sometimes smokers will tell me that they've been smoking all day or whatever and then they can smell it all your goes that's right and that's another good thing because, I see it okay my auntie told me you get showered and bathes up in your best soap and birth-death best perfume and then you come out and you put your light a cigarette up and it just takes the whole thing away so while you smoke is Eclipse it wouldn't be like that you know because you like to take a shower and you can put on your best perfume and you want to worry about that over all of your clothes and your hair okay so how has it make you feel I mean now, now you're in a clip smoker do you feel any different as being a smoother yeah because some people are welcome I've had people say we're just making stop smoking so you might make me stop smoking okay that's good or bad again this is there's no right or wrong answers in this is just got your opinions of okay let's see here the what do you think the public is going to say about this cigarette when it comes out on the market what's their reaction going to feel a lot like it a lot, it's the only one I really appreciate it why is that because this is as unique as all I can say is good for people that's in office because you know positions people are traveling on the planes for the hospital you don't worry about people complaining about the second-hand smoke okay if there was one benefit that's most important to you okay what would that be more than before I stop what's it what's the most important thing for you, you as it deals with eclipse, well hurting other people would have smoked the secondhand smoke okay yeah lately the government has come out and they've increased all the regulations on smoking you can't smoke in airports and etcetera on planes what do you how do you how would you explain this visor your congressman and I said well you know it's just a normal cigarette how do you explain the fact that this cigarette might be a little different, if I've never heard about it I'm Tom Costello says more for a pack but I think I'll be more healthier for people that don't smoke I think that like I said ownerless is smooth smoked taste is nice and some going to worry about staining your walls and your curtains your clothes you know y'all on your body and your hair so I want to thank the next person and he goes look like, I said then that's you that's on your washer I harm anyone else with that because my habit all right that's fair enough and you talked just a second ago you mentioned the staining what did you mean by that the studying of your teeth out staying of your your Upholstery and of your curtains you know yeah stuff like that okay how was house eclipse going to be any different than any other cigarette because that leaves those are staying on your guy tried it on your curtains and it's a difference in your teeth you know and then you, here on your hands yeah okay what is, I think that's it's hear anything else guys, I was just going to help you relax yes I do like it now it might if you didn't know I can probably really expressed to him in one paragraph 41 cents or a summary of all the great things about clips that you feel about it in other words he's a smoke rings like hey what is that what's up with that what's up with this cigarette, and and I guess it's almost like you're trying to sell it to him I've been doing just that for you all for you it's a new day it's a new cigarette out on the market but RJ Reynolds is very good cigarette for secondhand smokers yeah it's odorless tasteless and Ashley so I think that's well let me ask you one more, question what not everybody will like the cigarette you know there's two Different Strokes for different folks what type of person is going to smoke eclipse in your mind, people as lesson business yeah okay Kimmy dozen businesses have to deal with a lot of other business right okay did you want something Cary how would you ask your question here adjective for Eclipse like however you feel about the month the greater unique or wonderful amazing articulate the clips are and say that word and then the other thing is like, well is there a single word that can sum this cigarette up yeah it's Unique that's it yeah he closed his unique, okay that's it",0.8172140890697674,0.53240824,0.9128392

gpnh0063,"participation with two companies Brown & Williamson was also getting very aggressive with newly acquired American brands the combined company strength was leveraged and this acquisition resulted in increased retail presence the financial support by the competition was significant Laura large merchandising position was being negatively impacted at a time when Laura large needs were increasing due to New Brand introductions, line extensions increased promotional support and the growth of Newport the bottom line is Laura large ability to gain and maintain displays are needed facings was becoming more difficult, lorillard was presented with many challenges in the development of excel retail merchandising our overall challenge was to refocus Lords efforts with the merchandising program to meet its competition head on a comprehensive and aggressive program that would be supported by Senior lorillard Management was needed Laura large monthly package display payments were not competitive enough to meet objectives the first challenge was to, establish competitive payment schedules without getting into a bidding war for retail space our Second Challenge was to develop and place display Hardware that provided a more impactful Presence at retail and was appropriate for today and in the future our third challenge was to develop and obtain placement for high-impact permanent point of sale material that would clearly support lorillard brands with these major challenges working together, how to develop a successful action plan was our next step our mission was to get Target lorillard resources to provide aggressive and competitive levels of package and carton merchandising exposure to achieve our work plan objectives the development of competitive aggressive contracts was a key element of the Excel retail merchandising action plan payment levels developed were right on target or encouraging all retailers to, secure and maintain lorillard plans Laurel ards Excel plan was structured to pay for performance the more lorillard pack facings or curtain Rose the higher the payments previously lorillard display size and facings were not tied to payments with Excel the retailer increases dollars by increasing display facings or conversely loses payment if lorillard facings are reduced, in addition retailers are also paid for performance by being paid more money based on the large volume sold the bottom line the retailer is given an incentive to increase large business Excel has tiered payments for all merchandising formats payments are higher for self-service and lower for non Self Service on the counter or back bar placements Excel merchandising contracts are designed to encourage, Courage the placement of two displays One display for full price and one for price value Brands to meet our work plan objectives the XL plan specifically targets the fastest-growing classes of trade convenience and cigarettes stores this was accomplished by offering these classes of trade combination plans which link multiple merchandising elements in one extremely and aggressive payment, in all Excel plan payments are structured to be fair and Equitable for all retailers both chain and independent and lower volume retail accounts, the new Excel contracts include impactful and functional pack and carton displays with high-impact advertising as part of the plan, the second major portion of the action plan was to develop new hardware these pack displays are designed to be flexible displays are made to be merchandise self-service and non Self Service on the counter with a shield the XL counter displays are designed to be easily assembled using stacking components of four six and eight pack wide trays all trays were made to accommodate an 8-pack deep capacity to me, it promotional needs, new flexible lorillard carton fixtures were also developed, a 6-carbon wide Promotion Center and an impressive 10 carton wide lorillard fixture for use in high-volume Cardin locations this unit would also impact fully meet the need for lorillard merchandising in retail outlets without an industry carton fixture these Cardin units were also designed to be used in non Self Service environments which shielded locking doors plastic inserts provide the flexibility to, all types of special promotions pack and carton shelves are interchangeable providing flexibility to me merchandising brands in a variety of situations while the fixtures and displays provide significant flexibility impact was also increased through improved point of sale on the fixtures and the displays, exhale package counter displays provide a platform for New impactful Image building and price communicating at point of Purchase New 2 inch high Channel strips were included on the front and the rear of the package display this unit contains an impactful Riser that is also visible from the sides of both sides of the display and can be replaced to feature an attractive attention-getting backlit riser, exhale carton fixtures also were in need of more impactful point of sale in order to support this effort Channel strips are increased from 2 inch 24 inch high we also improve the impact of the Riser card and reduce Confusion by featuring special offer pricing only, the third element of the Excel merchandising action plan was to establish permanent point-of-sale presence this heightened presence would be valuable today and in the future if visibility of product were reduced to this end new and exciting permanent point of sale was developed this permanent point of sale was targeted to to fast-growing classes of trade convenience stores and cigarette stores within specific Excel merchandise, seeing plans here are a few examples, our limited time today would not allow for a complete description of excel retail merchandising program however we do feel that it is very important that we explain to you how successful the program has been to date The increased number of displays placed is exceptional you increased our participation with retail displays in both chains and Independence both full price and price value you increased our overall display face, things in thousands of outlets giving lorillard added inventory brand packing exposure and improving our ability to efficiently meet those work plan objectives but let's talk specifics on how working together resulted in success do you recall earlier in this presentation I indicated that 7000 package displays in General market stores had been lost from 1990 to 1997 I told you that Laurel Arts challenge, has to stem this decline well in four short months you working together regained 3800 of this 7000 store decline in four short months you eliminated over half of a seven-year decline earlier I indicated that another objective was to establish an aggressive multi-component Cigarette Outlet program in this high volume and growing class of trade as Randy spell indicated earlier, here there are four thousand eight hundred of these high volume cigarette Outlets nationally of which lorillard has some form of merchandising plan in over 90% I'm happy to report that you secured over 1,000 of our new multi-component Cigarette Outlet plans since the introduction of excel merchandising on July 1 1997 this represents over 20% of total cigarette Outlets nationally, our primary objective was to secure a full price package display price value package display and permanent advertising in each convenience store I am pleased to report that you achieve this most desirable objective in nearly four thousand two hundred new Outlets once again in only four short months in Chains over 34 chain voids have been filled representing over 1,000 displays were Laurel, art previous Lee had no display and in fact I was just informed by Bob call her Ella that that number is now 38, one of our key objectives was to achieve permanent advertising in conjunction with specific merchandising plans again to date you have achieved commitments of nearly 20,000 permanent pieces of lorillard point-of-sale once again an outstanding accomplishment in fact from July 1 1997 to the end of October just four short months nearly 11,000 new, displays have been placed that's an incredible 13 percent Improvement in total package displays when you consider exhale retail merchandising was introduced only a short time ago and the progress to date has been this positive expectations for the future are high as comprehensive as Excel is today working together to keep Pace with changing Trends has never been more important this, means that in the future all of us must take a leadership role to ensure lorillard merchandising plans are on target from recent competitive information we are seeing new fixturing that accommodates the cigarette category in a back bar scenario it is Apparent from this information that Philip Morris will continue its subversion to dominate backbar merchandising in a potentially restricted retail environment, we have seen Brown & Williamson recently unveiled new merchandising fixturing in all shapes and sizes and they are aggressively pursuing back bar positions r.j. Reynolds also has done its homework with merchandising Concepts featuring hanging displays unlike Philip Morris and brown and Williamson who are aggressively trying to move the retailer to back bar merchandising immediately r.j. Reynolds is taking a more cautious approach in fact r.j., nose is urging retailers to wait for a final resolve of legislation before facilitating expensive merchandising sets, Laura large objectives

grfy0038,"hello and welcome I'm Mark Firestone vice president and Associate general counsel of Philip Morris companies here in New York City today we have gathered employees from each of the Philip Morris operating companies they will be serving as your representatives as we talk about the litigation facing the company we're going to bring all of you up to date on some recent developments that you may have read about or heard about and we're going to answer your questions about what all this means to Philip Morris and to you, the employees who are the hearts and souls of this great company our employees are joined today by Chuck wall senior vice president for litigation and Associate general counsel of Philip Morris Chuck is responsible for managing the company's tobacco litigation we also have with us today Steve Parrish Steve is senior vice president and general counsel of Philip Morris USA and in charge of our worldwide Regulatory Affairs Department here in New York, we'll begin with Chuck it will start things off Chuck everyone at Philip Morris is committed to developing producing and maintaining world-class products and we are equally committed to a vigorous defense of our rights to produce those products we have consistently been successful in court because we have followed a simple straightforward course of action, when we are challenged in court we will aggressively defend ourselves, and when government agencies and others attempt to take away our legal rights we will go to court to ensure that we retain those rights, as many of you are aware the company is involved in several areas of litigation that are of extreme importance both to the company and the industry, most of this litigation is in the United States although we are seeing cases in other countries as well Steve and I will discuss those cases later, in a few important instances the company has filed suit because it has been necessary to vindicate our position, the company is defending itself against those who would impose liability for health problems claimed because by smoking or by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, there are four general areas we are involved in first there are the traditional smoking and health cases involving smokers who seek to impose liability on the industry for diseases which they claim are caused by cigarette smoking, second there are individual environmental tobacco smoke cases, third there are class action cases either involving smoking and health or environmental tobacco smoke and forth there are state government suits claiming damages from the industry in the form of repayment of Medicaid funds expended on behalf of smokers, I should also mention two other categories of cases that we are involved in, Philip Morris has gone to court as a plaintiff against the ABC television network which falsely claim that we are spiking our products with nicotine, and we have sued the EPA for its arbitrary and capricious classification of environmental tobacco smoke as a human carcinogen, in addition we are involved in a growing number of cases in other countries, in every instance without exception I can say today that the facts and the law are on our side and that I firmly believe we will ultimately prevail, our past experience in litigating these cases teaches us that when all the facts are examined by a jury we win, at the same time each of these cases presents a unique challenge for us and we would like to talk about each area of litigation and then we'll be happy to respond to your questions thanks Chuck Steve why don't you begin with an update on the most recent case that went to trial earlier this year thanks Mark the first area we want to cover is the traditional smoking and health case our most recent case the Rogers case just ended in Indianapolis once again, the jury heard all the evidence this trial lasted a full month and when it was over the jury refused to award a dammit any damages to the plaintiff the case was significant because the plaintiff's lawyer attempted to base much of his attack on the so called addiction Theory the plaintiff was the Widow of a local lawyer Richard Rodgers who died from lung cancer at the age of 52 the plaintiff's lawyer claimed that Roger started smoking when he was a child and smoked up to three packs of cigarettes, it's a day after several unsuccessful attempts to stop smoking Rogers quit after a half-hour visit to a hypnotist the Rogers case focused on to claims by the plaintiff first the lawyers tried to persuade the jury that cigarettes are unreasonably dangerous in large part because of their so-called addictive quality under Indiana Law this type of product liability claim is based on a reasonable consumers expectation of a given product, our chief defense to this claim was the affirmative defense of incurred risk or Assumption of risk that is that Rogers new of acclaimed risks of smoking including addiction yet chose to smoke until he finally quit much of the facts in support of that defense came from Rogers himself he testified in his videotaped deposition that he had known of the risks of smoking since he was a child as an adult he said he took an annual physical that included a chest x-ray because he, concerned about the risks of smoking Additionally the plaintiffs in Rogers sought sought to hold the companies liable on a negligence Theory claiming that the industry should have warned Rogers of the alleged addictive qualities of cigarettes before 1969 when Congress made its first changes to the warning label requirements because Congress mandates the warnings the Supreme Court has ruled plaintiffs cannot Sue on the basis of failure to warn of the alleged smoking risks after 1969, nine the jury and Rogers refused to award damages to the plaintiff and the plaintiffs attorneys have not yet asked the court to schedule a second trial, in the past 40 years there have been over 400 cases filed against the industry all of the companies have taken a firm position against settling these cases and in the 23 cases that have gone to trial none has resulted in any damages being paid to a plaintiff yet plaintiffs lawyers continue to try and there are a number of cases on the horizon including one in New Jersey that could come to trial by the end of this year thanks Steve before we turn to the ETS, class action and State Medicaid cases that have been filed against our company and other cigarette manufacturers I'd like Chuck to talk a little bit about how we think these cases have come about thanks Mark we believe that a small organized group of plaintiffs lawyers are behind all of the recent lawsuits these plaintiffs lawyers who have become famous for targeting various Industries such as",0.8780299007692309,0.74937016,0.912839

grgv0183,"thanks for coming out in the rough weather, okay everybody here, again thank you for coming I appreciate it my name is Keith they're going to give me a name tag here in a second and we'll get started what we're going to be doing a lot of homework tonight so everybody brought you glasses and your writing hands okay we're going to do some reading and writing and I'm going to talk about it the first thing we're going to do is fill out the blue questionnaire it's got questions on the front and on the back so if everybody will just take one and pass one to their neighbor and will pass out the, business is a little need to fill that out then we'll start talking somebody got the reach of pencils I can't do it just circle the circle the answer and we'll get started I will I'll tell you is your as you're going here that what we're going to do tonight this is part of a research project in which we're doing several of these around the country what we're investigating is how the media treats us corporations, and it'll become a pretty apparent we're going to it says business week at the top we're going to look at a business week article about a major corporation in fact it's one of the ones you can see there it's kind of controversial and we want to see how how people how Americans react when they when they see these things in the media all right that's largely what we're doing so that's why we're doing this question first and we'll have some other things for you to fill out, but one other request to everybody has a number one through 10 on their name tag if you put that number up at the top where it says ID code is put your number in others three slices put it in somewhere,it looks like we're pretty much done the main company that is being asked about there's Philip Morris so let's focus on that a little bit what are your overall in pinions of Philip Morris, anybody just go ahead and jump in a study the ground rules are speak freely speak openly age no right or wrong answers, if I were throwing out they've got six make cigarettes I think I got that too how many people have a bad boys in here check it around the country this morning oh really I got about 90% of the people I run into that voices right now, it was a it was a million dollars we'd all be rich because it was catching it again or something that is that Y2K bug Vicki what do you think it's like you said they are just said first thing you think of is me keeping the commercial for like you know cult film horse that's associated with and I think they're always going to be associated with cigarettes and I what else to do I'm not a really throw bottle I only make like tobacco products and cigarettes and I'm just alone Amin Osman, Walker and I'm against smoking in general but that's you know my opinion so I understood like number for question I kind of had kind of a sliding between one or two because in number one you can understand when senior Executives in the company they do have legitimate jobs to yet you know it's tough to like really small but the answer on that one for me so let's talk about that one that's pretty Stark, contrast that they're making you make it how many people chose that I think many people chose the second one while he's a appreciate that they give money and I appreciate that they do jobs but basically they're doing that and they're killing people and they don't mind that that's okay and it's supposed to be okay why because they've got lots of money and they can give money to politics and politics can pass the bills and pass their needs so if, you're going to ask me to be so starving I'm going to say you know what they're doing is immoral because if they really were trying to put money in the right direction they wouldn't be trying to harm people so that's why I feel sorry if you from Philip Morris, everybody could look just look at your lungs, Take a Bow, an x-ray of your lungs and see what the smoking is doing to it I don't think that I don't know some people doesn't matter either okay how about somebody took the other part of number for their senior Executives any other company have legitimate job to do okay I guess I feel that I guess especially since the early 60s when they put the warnings on the packs and and I really believe that we as a government and or Society or to look worse, self straight in the face and say if you want to make something illegal make it illegal but to start this nonsense where you're putting monetary considerations on education and people's lives and you're not brave enough to make it a legal and put her out of business we ought to look at ourselves in the mirror and be ashamed of ourselves,did you think it was accountability to the public or the accountability to the cigarette companies also I think that I think that as far as Executives having a job to do and as far as Executives having a job to do and as far as people working for that company yes it's it's tobacco it's also a lot of other things and I also think that since the early 60s and since, the warnings have been out there and we will allow people to create their own decisions in life about so many things did to litigate this thing for the profitability of a few with absolutely very limited chance of any gain through education all you have to do is look at those ridiculous Billboards on the Schuylkill Expressway the probably won't taste teenagers to smoke now if this is what you want to do here and that's fine that's fine now and then this this is another, I'm liberal or conservative or intelligent or unintelligent but if this is what the intelligence of America says that we should do I think that we need that we need to take a mirror effect for any positive effects and really shake our head at this one and as far as people having the right to work you know what they have the right to work and they have the right because you know what there's a lot of people who make bombs there's a lot of people that you have no Concept in the software business how that software is being applied and there's a lot of them are all stuff that goes on and, litigate it through the courts and the blame executives are governmental to hang our health said head and shames and his voters would hang her head and shames that's why I wear I had a problem with it the question was because I work for a little I used to work for a large pharmaceutical company types of drugs and I mean some people may have problems with what those drugs could do or what we have in there but that yet and as a cohesive unit of being part of the company I enjoyed that and like like the benefits and what that what you know what the company can do for you, but you know they make drugs that are controversial Florida you chose the legitimate I'm a nonsmoker I've never smoked and I hate being and Smoky room and I wish there were more and non-smoking restaurants and clubs and more like California where the restaurants and clubs are all non smoking however I believe in freedom of choice and I agree with Kip a lot that there is, enough out there weren't enough mornings and enough information out there that people have a freedom of choice they can choose to smoke with could choose to stay healthy and not smoke and I don't think it's up to the government to make that decision for you I don't like all that government intervention do you think that Philip Morris is a is a cigarette company is changing at all or they pretty much stay in the same the windows being, but it's obviously we're seeing the whole public opinion environment in the whole legal environment change around them are they changing or not Beverly please do I think of changing I think the diversifying and all sorts of other products and everything I think they're trying very hard to diversify themselves specifically from tobacco and going into all kinds of other fields and public relations and you know all that sort of thing I think they're trying to change greatly but I think basically people still think of Philip Morris is you know brought in tobacco people, eagle, Ricky I was like stuck right between the Middle was like I didn't really wanted it and really like to for the answer before I believe in you if you want to smoke and smoke and you know you have the right to choose and there's going to be as most people buy the products going to be jobs created by it and people need jobs they're going to go to where they can get the money how about how about them changing and what you think they're changing Michael, I mean I think they're changing because they have to because people getting tired of statistics of 100 literally hundreds of thousands of people die a year from smoking related causes I think just to keep themselves going, I think people are tired of lying and I don't think I think that they really had you know hit the wall with that so I think that they have to clean up their act so I really believe that they are changing well does anybody see the movie the inside people suddenly get the feeling that, I mean those tactics that they described in that movie must be fairly true although it wasn't Philip Morris to company but, the tactics that are described must be true otherwise they may be open who lived and fought it for 30 years you know to not let people know what they were doing and then move on to other organizations where people are even less educated than we are in this country about cigarettes that that I find absolutely deplorable and move on to where people don't know even the slightest bit, we know which isn't everything and then you know try to push the cigarettes on to people who don't know if I have a surgeon general's warning on exactly the point about that about it's right there this this stuff is harmful but most people start smoking when they're teenagers and who makes that they can good good decisions when you're a teenager, statistics in front of me that if you don't smoke before your, you 21 your chances of ever smoking are very small something like that I don't excuse me I'm not talking about a cigar or whatever so that you know don't tell me that the Brain Trust the new in full Morris or anything I mean they don't know what they have to do regardless of what they put on the advertisements or their promotional stuff or give away free jackets or any of that they have to hook people young and they're probably not the only consumer, other companies or behavioral companies that have to hook people lunch young don't tell me that the beer companies they liquor companies and all that your behavior doesn't start at twenty one or twenty six Behavior starts at and you know what there's another thing and I'm a parent don't tell me Behavior doesn't start with parents and what they allow the kids to do where is accountability in this world where somebody could really look at themselves in the face and say you know what, I've done everything I can do and they're accountable to your kids into yourself and I there's so little accountability in this world it's sickening everybody's all right go ahead Lisa I wanted to say just because you put the label not you but Philip Morris put some a label it's hazardous to your health if Kip decides he's going to light up a cigarette right now he's not just making the decision for himself he's making a decision for the entire room you just big kids because just because, my choice is now not my choice anymore and what happens is if I said to Kip Kip would you mind smoking outside often Kip would say yes I do mind smoking outside I have the right to smoke I choose to smoke I am being harmed by that I have secondhand smoke and that is offensive to meet the warning label means almost nothing to me on that, Point okay and in a lot of respects they're now finding that secondhand smoke is worse than the actual sense of um choosing not to smoke the choice is being stripped for me now I don't have the right I told you we were going to look at an article or put these out in front of you I don't want you to read them yet let's just I guess I'll pass them around I can't reach that far that's past my just kind of put it in front of you look at the cover just look at the cover the part about Philip Morris don't read the inside yet it's rather, link the article but look at the cover I want to I want to put your answer some questions about it and actually instead of talking about it I'm going to pass out sheets and you have to write so this can be writing exercises there's three questions just write in a few short answers if you put a few short sentences clause and speech 141 word you want, there's three questions what's the main point communicated by the cover what do you think the main focus of the article is going to be and all you know says what is the main folks are we think the main focus your articles going to be and what impact does this cover have on your perceptions of Philip Morris any or not and if it reconfirms if you already think you can just put that down,reacting to the cover,okay then when you finish filling that out you can take the time to read this I think if you read every single word the way I read which is about third grade level it takes about 22 minutes to do it so let's see if he can kind of move through it in about maybe you know a little less and I like 15 15 18 minutes and I'll everybody just read through it and then we'll talk about it, this was an article that appeared in businessweek I'm a bad at the date on it I guess November 29 so right after Thanksgiving,by the way anybody read this, I'll put some popcorn in the middle anybody wants some lovely if you get thirsty there's a little tray drinks over here to feel free to get up and keep reading when you get a drink, I'll be right back,one last piece of business is put your number on the yellow sheet to like you did on the blue then there's two sides to the yellow sheet in case you didn't see it just like that,it's like we're about ready how about somebody offer up a comment for me about what you think after reading this, you know the road rage area it's amazing that they have corporate people haven't been shot I mean really and truly a bunch of crazy so you know besides you have to say that for the money they're being paid I take the risk to if I mean if they could live with themselves for what they're being paid and I think it's that hard decision for them to stick it out because if they're pay me half a million dollars a year I don't know that I you know don't but don't tease people have various towns where let's say they're earning a, a million dollars a year somewhere else where they can go somewhere else they could and make some money they probably could but don't they have but don't but don't they have individual rights working in a legal job they want so that the concept is somebody coming on my property putting anything on my door and doing all that or if my if my if my wife had a mink coat throwing fake red blood on her something like that I mean nobody wants to be treated but now I don't think that's all he said your rights, it was like a lot of food for thought and everything I am a non-smoker have never had a cigarette in my mouth but um, you know it's very but your smokes smokes smokes cigars so am I here Pat you didn't say the word but I'm not hearing the word sympathetic I definitely said that that I mean I you know it's just, you forget I mean it honestly and truly I don't know that I even thought about you know like I'm a nice Miguel kid that has lung disease so you know I mean he's smoking I don't want to sit near people that smoke you know I'm very verbal when I'm out in a place and there's somebody smoked I don't want them near me Etc but you know you think about how crazy you know I'm not crazy like that the you know with the right you know and to think about the road things that they would have the family you have to feel sorry I don't care how much money he's making I mean, abuse is got to be, would anybody else use that word after reading this article Lisa but I guess I kind of disagree with that sort of, who's there getting before we before we get there I saw is anybody agree with Pat the sort of feel more sympathetic toward the top corporate people after seeing this I understand okay I just want to get a sense if it's okay go ahead Lisa I did I did understand more of what they're doing because I was told things I didn't know before but I don't feel sympathetic and I guess I don't think that they're entitled to feel badly if people are lashing out at them and their home, when I am in a place that I think is private like a table that I have paid for to have dinner with my husband and evening I am being assaulted by the smoker next to me that's not a corporation but not but it is it is the CEOs fault because if if they didn't continue to take that job and they didn't continue to hire troubleshooters to find ways to manipulate advertising and manipulate people to smoke there wouldn't be that person next to me because the cigarette wouldn't be there and they can figure out, put their genius to know something marijuana is illegal to have come it's all over the place I mean you know also from having that liquor you know it's killing things next because they pay somebody a lot of money to run a corporation to be smart I don't think they physically have to take news from people and I you know and thinking about it look, you can't you have to give the guy credit to they're trying to turn some things around whatever way you want to look at it they trying to because they'll lose their money sharehouse truth and their greed will make them find somebody's billions enough they don't want to lose money they want their companies to continue when the profit shares dug up their pockets upper their home suffer their families don't get what they want but these people are intelligent people that could go to any Corporation big Korver I don't think why why you know I don't understand why he's not her or what gives him the standard who's maybe beliefs and maybe he can make a, France and change but Wars happens to give a lot of money to education I don't people know don't want to take it I mean your kid goes to college e you would like some Financial backing even if it did come from it you know if it's going to help you swim away I don't think so it was Michael wouldn't would he what do you think about this this article after getting it was your reaction well he told me some things I didn't know but, I don't like what you mean again, first of all I know there's some of the executives of top Executives and programs that put the personality a little bit into what's behind the corporations and I still get I get the feeling that these guys you know they're saying there that they don't have they're trying to get away from this bunker mentality but that's I think that's what still coming through it, it's very adversarial all the time and they were just keep trying to find ways to maneuver around I mean basically the cigarette part mean they're just trying to sell as many cigarettes is that cat and that is their main concern too, just keep increasing the market share at work no matter how they can do it basically what they're going there pointing to is, taking it away from other cigarette companies you know I think they're realizing they can't grown the way to increase their share is to actually combat other cigarette companies and not and increase the overseas wherever they can I mean that's the whole point good we'll just being illegal, come out of you I mean how can you, be you know how can you be against it in the sense I mean this is that's what our country stands for I mean I agree with you I think Lisa's Point as far as public, use of that stuff I mean I don't like it either I mean not anymore I was at a party Saturday and just coming on because I was getting physically sick everybody you know so many smokers so I don't like it but you know I it's what are you doing after reading this, I was amazed at how well I didn't know they were so Diversified or trying to make so we go to survive in the in the early part of the article is talking about a hundred million dollars to persuade kids not smoke what they mean how where did it go what kind of education but what were they telling the kids you know most of the ads that, see now I'm also the ones that I've seen are you know making it cool to smoke and you know yeah but they have their size they are under 18 you know you didn't have to sell cigarettes to the kids you know we ID people and everything like that, he jumps over Brooklyn Bridge do you want to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge to be sexy and hot and funny and that is it they're selling they're not advertising the Brooklyn Bridge they are advertising sex appeal and coolness but smoking I can I come in but I don't know that I can protect my son and my daughter I know that in my house I won't allow certain things but when they're allowed to go out make their own decision they're in college I don't, know what they're doing you know if you can teach you how I did it and that's all you have to do is I hope I do I came from a family that's why didn't I smoke I've never had a cigarette in my mouth, I mean so you know why is everybody else here you hope that you instill in your children the right things to do I mean let me ask you a question about the nature of this article how do you think this magazine business week in the reporter I think they treat biltmore's they fair or not, a lot of what women like they're saying about how they were harassed because of their position but also show that you know they're going to stick by their their job they're going to stay in it and like with the guy whose families are sort of well as a matter of priorities which was more important is family the security of his family at the job again, what's interesting point was about the other employees to there's they are, I'm not charged yeah are being attacked or anything within feeling bad about where the work I feeling hear about them where they were I found that interesting and also that they're paying higher salaries to get people into the competition, here we come back to I'm going to pay you 40 thousand dollars in a fifteen thousand dollar signing bonus right out of college to come and work now you're going to sit there and some 22 year old can use in the same geez I can go work for the city and I could get a twenty two thousand dollar job and Philip Morris or anybody and the other major corporations who were about to craft I don't care who it is we'll sit down say here it is oh and by the way you're going to start at forty thousand dollars a year but guess what here's, check for fifteen thousand dollars just for coming with us thanks a lot you think the going to turn it down you know what it's really do that person number one is goes up there's like this company White's what I'm able to do for them and I can go places in at that's the main concern well what do you mean concerns you well I think that a lot of people they are especially a lot of young people now they want to get ahead I mean that's that's the thing and it's like if they can they can kind of look at the company and see maybe we'll look it, all the positive things are doing and kind of get away from what the company really is because you know when iI can't I don't totally know what I would do if I was younger and I I don't think I'd want to but they really make it so enticing that it's something that you really think there's a company today you can get away with what it got away with 20 years ago I don't I think it's a different kind of world I think we're all skeptical I think that we don't trust anybody or anything there's no there's no trust your neighbor trust your, and you know you go out into a world that you know what we're more aware more opinionated we're more everything more so more vocal about everything you know if you don't hear from your mother your father your family going to hear from the next person sitting next to you can light up a cigarette whether you like it or not do you make a choice to smoke it to work for a company or companies going to be good to you and you needed to pay off your college loans or keep your family do you just are and you're working hard hard to justify your choice and stuff but who's to say that the company is not trying to change a little bit, B I mean so they're going after market will you know what we have to inform the rest of the world but we as United States of America are really made this company Rich Jeff I don't know if I'll let you finish but your train of thought about them offering this kind of money it was that do you see that as a positive yes I do number one for the younger generation is going out now looking for employment and this isn't necessarily Philip Morris or any of the other tobacco companies it, any company, everybody has become goal-oriented at this point from College on even in high school to get through college to get to the big job a real job and there's nothing wrong with that this is what everything is geared to American Dream, what's happened is to the exclusion of everything else that's where the focus is going with our young kids, unfortunately it doesn't matter whether they go to Philip Morris or anyplace else they become egocentric and Company will give this is the second time you read it you the only person I ever did before what do you think what are your reactions, on reading this article well I really did not die my guess I go back to accountability so that I'm not sure why I changed you know and I follow Philip Morris both you know because I'm involved in some investment things as far as researching as much as I can as a sort of a job at night and I know a lot about the company had followed it for years and I also am not a smoker so that, nothing changed with the article because I'm still holding on the concept of accountability and I just see very little little accountability on this issue in the broader scope in this country I see very little guts for our legislators that you just flat-out commands they make it illegal know maybe Al Capone would come back from the dead Fields a but nonetheless make it illegal and case in point the past head of the federal Food and Drug, stration a guy named Kessler, is trying to get the FDA to regulate nicotine well that's a farce and it was already in articles by like judge souter and judge O'Connor have come out and said how can the Food and Drug Administration and it's in the Supreme Court right now how can they regulate nicotine we can just outlawed how can the Food and Drug Administration if a drug is harmful does it get through the fog Food and Drug Administration no well how can they regulate it it was it's the stupidest thing in the world and yet we'll go through the legal thing of going through, because nobody wants to be accountable to any truth nobody and it's a farce but if we want to go through this legal imaginations well that's what we do every day when somebody rear ends you you know if you fall in your own house you break your leg and your phone your neighbor's house you might think twice about suing them before in Bloomingdales you got a lawyer out right away and soon but you're still broke your leg install your own fault okay that's the country we have we're going to sue everybody we're going to not going to be accountable for our own actions that's where we are, and I think a lot of people mostly Beverly Hills see you're talking you would what do you think what's your reaction to this article my reaction to the article is that it gave me some insight into different different ideas that they stressed in the article but it didn't change my mind about Phillip Mars it didn't change my mind about I agree with kids about it's not only felt Mars it's everyone along the line all the way up to the Congress the president the legislative judicial It Go all, everybody's out for the money and so it gave me some you know insight into how they think but I always I think I also knew that they were one-sided they're very one-sided they have to be in order to work that job you can't go to work thinking well maybe I should really think of the kids smoking and lung disease and and we've waste more money on on the after effects of tobacco than any other disease in the country and I don't think they can go to work that way and it just stress that to me, it's sort of reinforce what I thought the article but gave me a little bit more insight, all right, what about the guy on the cover here Jeffrey Bible how do you think he comes across introspective, introspective yeah that's the way that's the first that I had when I looked at where are we going the company what's going to happen I have to get my you know my point across but I'm thinking but it definitely looks introspect use comfortable in his own skin that he's going to whatever decisions he makes you'll stand by them and I really don't think that it matters what anybody else thinks and I'm not saying he's so cocky about it he's just a man who's comfortable with himself,I think he loves contemplative as if he's no he has the weight of the world on your shoulders if I saw this are flying didn't see it if I would see it I would look through it I would because I would want to see what he was thinking what he was saying although it wasn't very different from what I anticipated but I think he's very contemplative and thinking like how can he do better and you know that kind of thing that's what it's stress is it looks like we have a problem with our image and let me see let me tell you what I think, think it's about you know it's an interesting thing with the ashtray the cigarette that's the first thing I saw and to me contemplative probably is giving the guy more positive this looks like a tough little guy who's really going to defend his turf, and he comes across in the article as being he's you know he's been in there long time now you know, I think he's sort of the challenge there's a challenge a company with the trouble and he's now they recruited him and he's had a lot of years of experience he is ready to retire looking forward to retiring and she took on this challenge, it's very interesting pose very and if it will take you to look at it there's an old daguerreotype photograph sitting down on Washington in the Smithsonian of Abraham Lincoln you put a beard on him and look at that you I'm going to tell you something this is a very very very intelligent strong, I'll tell you one thing I really, I would not want to do battle with him now you're like a casual post for the spine or strength you know make no bones about it I mean I think I've made it clear that for freedom of choice but make no bones about it I firmly believe these guys are the Prince of Darkness because they know what that the product has been bad now they are making the byproduct this point of another generation that now they're in the hot seat because don't forget that the back of company, had a pretty darn good in the 50s the 60s the 70s the 80s they want every tobacco case they could and through various legal ramifications that we have in this country we were able to you know they're able to attack the cigarette companies just like they might attack you know the industries that every one of us are in for whatever reason I don't know what those Industries are but the the down deep these are this is not a good thing it just depends whether you believe I think that this guy has the right to say Hey look it's freedom of choice now come on over at either declared it, you're damn right there's a problem got some great PR guys too because you're making the there's one problem with Claire you want me to tell you what it is yeah hold the bottle it doesn't matter the company Philip Morris makes but if you've ever see you've done your research every atom throw smoother believe me I'm not a make 35 cents a pack of cigarettes gloves and where's all the rest of that money go let me tell you where it goes It goes, into taxes so beautifully your state level the start they think it's okay to not only take in Revenue all these years they think it's okay to sue the tobacco companies for more money and then we're going to try to do it on a federal level let's go we're trying to do on a place actual level individuals get you know get together and when it ends where does the money for all those programs more we're going to go, after the liquor companies the beer the brother Brewing company's let's see the people put fat and potato chips and it's going to be never-ending because the differences though smoking, the smoker is hard and not just yourself but those around you can still be around smokers will sometimes you don't always make it about 10 years ago 10 years ago your argument had a lot of strength to live every day now more 10 years that your arguments been watered down because not only can't most people smoke at work but you know I don't think they'll do it right outside the door, unless of course you get behind the wheel and you kill me you're right however absolutely right the smoking part that is not just harmful to yourself but it is to those around you it is it is it is depreciated it's 10% of what it was 10 years ago you can't smoke on airplanes anymore you can't smoke and that's fine I'm also thrilled with it don't get me wrong you can't smoke on set the buses you can't with her, wrong baby that's not an issue anymore believe it or not it's not really a big Health concern issue you might not like the way your clothes smell but you're not going to inhale enough smoke going to a party one night staying three to four hours to get lung cancer emphysema that is good question we we've touched on this a little bit nobody really elaborated though I want you to please in this article they talk about how Philip Morris owns crap food and Miller Brewing how does that make you feel about those other companies, these that they're owned by they're essentially a cigarette come pick up craft because we've always had a good reputation that is good that's a positive I mean that's just something that just kind of subconsciously with her board foot is like the soothing thing of the Americans I mean it's macaroni and cheese in it, it stays within their concept of expertise in marketing and it really does, okay let me let me just highlight a couple of paragraphs that argued only not open up your pages I'll just tell you the there's one early on where the CEOs got Geoffrey Bible talks about how he how he changed and I can went from fighting to negotiating with critics that now who knows his idea to give up or he voluntarily gave up the Marlboro Man as an advertising symbol and they agreed to though hundred and seventy five billion dollars set, moment, what do you think of that that went through that part of the story let's reaction to that Kip I think that it kind of their heads and said brand names is what everybody's trying for and marble is the number one brand and they wouldn't give up anything else bad there's no sincerity in that whatsoever took it off the tennis courts and everything else, honking man on this horse and that they settled it down a bit pushback from it so you know I think it's in advertising, they settle it down but there's no way you believe them no it doesn't it doesn't make you do they have no choice of how much advertising do you believe not very much, okay then there was the next one to talk about we're alluded to a little bit one of the other Executives I think his name is semantic he's the one that had the wreath put on his house talk about his wife and then he said when he said a parties somebody asked him a question he said I can't live somebody else's life, remove risk from the from their lives we're spending a hundred million dollars a year on anti-smoking campaign for youth anti you smoking there's no Billboards we've trained thirty thousand retailers that space kind of spot fake IDs so we're trying to do something about underage smoking what do you what do you think about when you read but you know what, he was not to hate seeing somebody just said they're covering their but they do it in a very Insidious way, they actually have seen some programs on the what they actually do in the anti-smoking campaigns it's pathetic it's as if you know it's so pathetic that you think just used to act as if they're they're actually coming on strong and in fact they're not coming on strong at all so they say we spent you know 1 million in this area 1 million in that area they know you know that they spend in that area is so calm particular sits just it tells the kid such a mixed message that it's not strong whatsoever one thing, just like he says he spent 100 million anti-smoking campaign I would like to have seen how much they actually spend on Advertising pre-pro advertising just to see what kind of percentage they're spending forehand Time by see kids can buy cigarettes as easily as they could mind years ago I really I really honestly truly believe that I don't think kids can go into war or 7-Eleven and buy cigarettes like they could have been beyond the three, is it not enough I don't know and why aren't they buying cigarettes they trying to buy the cigarettes where the parents again you know so I can't ability again I think that you know I don't know good food it was very quickly I think it was two separate issues what semantic said one was I can't live somebody else's life and the other was yeah look we're spending a hundred million dollars on the one sense he was saying look you know people have freedom of choice and then I think he just destroyed, his own position by saying look what good guys we are we spend a million here hundred million there and that's simply put in the cost of doing business to generate a profit don't tell me it's for the public good it's a business, I give them credit because they are responding to the need and the demand the demand has sure been it is necessary to have that, give them credit for then still shoving down a carcinogenic but I do give them credit for accountably answering to the public anger and was being set forth to them but I'm just saying well forget it this is what we're doing this damn by be careful if they can't so now their hands up against the wall their greed is right there they're going to find ways a rather the very bright men but I do give them the credit that they are at least responding, the next one was the quote from the guy who's responsible for the worldwide the non US market and he makes the point or it says in there was there talking about him that Philip Morris says eighty-three youth preventative programs going in 55 countries and he says quote we don't want kids to smoke because it exposes us to attack as an industry what do you think of that what bothered me most is that they were going abroad, I do live abroad but I'm going to guess they're not as educated and I'm going to guess a lot of places that they're selling cigarettes don't even know to note that they can sue or have the finances to sue the way America does I had a problem with that I wasn't sure where they were actually putting those cigarettes traveling for the little bit that we have we've seen children smoking in areas that I don't know what their regulations are here, we don't result in wah wah here we don't let it go through vending machines as we did before but there we do and they even made the price cheaper to keep up with the competitors well now we're going to offer LNM this the lower price one you can still get a great smoke out of it but it's lower price so who's buying that I think it's a blatant lie start smoking when you're young you probably won't, and they know that that nobody's going to think I stole notice that as many kids what I mean when I was like 13 about a lot of kids smoke II what I still know who's out there nail is seems to be the same thing I still see a lot of kids, 1.2 billion people you want to smoke if you've ever been to the Orient that much time there as I have, today and places of they like to smoke the next one was was the discussion and I think Jeff my brought this up to that whole discussion of you know there's risky products out there there's cigarettes there's beer there's hot dogs you know and if they go after cigarettes today they're going after alcohol next and they're going after hot dogs potato chips when you think of that line of logic that kind of comments on it, it's probably true they're going to get started on the to an extent you know drinking and driving kills people cigarette smoke gives you cancer kills people but if you eat a potato chip and choose to kill yourself I choose to eat and be fat you know Mom I'm called to my already so who's accountable me you and I'm saying gee I'm not hurting anybody else around or her life yeah idea but the idea, but yeah but the idea of that you know oh my gosh like they're putting some Molina in the product and you know that were Sweet and Low like hopefully having one after Sweet Love years and years ago I mean great cancer brain tumors will diabetics have been using sweet love for 100 years and guess the wash cycle makes this is what they want so they took the siren Off the Mark but it's not hurting anybody there were people making the graduate school starts, in 10 years from now will be the be your company's okay so how is this as a line of reasoning for Philip Morris to make is it effective or not I think I think the public relations department in these companies are going full head of steam last time I looked in the 60s there was something called the domino effect where the whole world was busy going to be communist, it's actually going the other way I mean that was the big war machine thing well you know if we don't stop in Vietnam got it will go all over the place you know and I think you know we already have a situation where we're okay is a country to keep taking away accountability now whether you want to call a domino effect the hot dogs too you know fats and stuff like this other thing but we're already allowing the lack of accountability in this country, anybody else with the domino effect with other products is this I mean even though cigarette companies admit it's addictive now and that takes it out of the ground with just being able to drink beer whenever you want being you know having a hot dog thing, living a lifestyle it might not be healthy once your Hook when you're 13 or 14 sometimes people can't quit I mean like just you know I don't know personally but the difference between quit like 20 times and he was getting very good at it, you differently than cigarettes to so all along alcohols been viewed differently to back is a big industry is going to meet or this country was founded on the tobacco industry you know and that you take away to back a you take a quart you take the underpinnings of a lot of our economy oh it's almost like a necessary evil major chunk of the tax dollars is what all of your program they're not old as gasps oh about taxing all the other ones make it, is the woman shouts allude to here the the guy who's the head of Miller Brewing talked about having two sons 17 and 24 not wanting either one of them to drink or smoke and saying that it's my responsibility as a parent not the government's to tell them not to what about that total agreement I'm kind of like great but what happens what Kitty says you my dad says not to smoke not to drink and he works for a company that produces the most there's like you know what's wrong with I suppose you don't believe it, child your drink and yet this is where you are peddling your money and where your greed is meeting with I didn't get that the guy is in there and say look I'm making five hundred thousand dollars a year in million dollars well because of you tells us kids don't smoke and don't drink your legal age any responsibility, until that time comes I see you in this house smoking the sunrise my wrinkles appear your fingers then you just say I'm sorry doesn't do anything that little statement doesn't really do anything to change the image that one might have the company you know it's in it doesn't mean it's just like fluff of course people, going to tell their children that smoke and drink even a CEO of a company that is tobacco run and of course to be responsible but it doesn't change your mind or any readers mind about what they think of that person or what they think at the company because he tells the 17 and 20 year old child have to smoke and drink does it change your mind, there was in the last one that was the lawyer who was at the end he had the story where he was talking they were talking about him where he was watching TV and saw the ABC Story come on about saying that Philip Morris manipulates the nicotine level in cigarettes that he went right out and sued them and won got three million dollar check took out an ad in the New York Times what about that, comment cocky lawyer joke, it's something that you know if you go by The Stereotype of a lawyer it's an expected reaction well don't forget this guy's not just a lawyer from I know this guy's vice-chairman our company is very big I mean there's a little difference between a lawyer and just being a lawyer who's going to just you know throw procedure I'm sorry which said you the first he was there outside counsel mostly and then he was brought on to a much higher position, so she was he did good what do you think about him telling that story sort of the recounting the water big roast yeah it really bothered me because you know what I felt that they were trying to accomplish something with it with me they accomplish something in the beginning they lost it at the end for me personally I don't know I don't know I like it pretty reviled at this the the spin I get from the Press on things and then I'm supposed to just go 60 Minutes must be right, there are this or that you know if it gets to be once again where's the accountability accountability is that when something comes over the air and you're going to call it as gospel truth now I don't know whether it's truthful or not about the nicotine or whatever but if it was wrong and once again it's within our system he should have taken off both shoes throw them through the television set and really sued them to death but is it because that's wrong to accuse somebody if you're wrong, I didn't know whether he you know and don't forget who's right and who's wrong it's not what is right or wrong I know there's a winner or a loser not that is right I just, is it was it semantics they want on or was it fact they want on because I'm in the hood there I said it's not addictive they were form of a logical way that gives it not a drug it's not addictive I was very much an actual win actually know that the tobacco companies have block long as long as, another lawsuit you know what I mean when million it the end Who's the who are the losers in the whole game just it bothered me and I had to tell you that that you know you know about how these places together and like I have a Little Bit of Sympathy prior to and I look at the skies and walk the hell does he have to stay in this company for and 60-some years old is it really good no it's a lot of money, the other side stand up and they well yeah, The Libertine is manipulated but but we're not at all isn't the press and isn't a press a big business yeah okay let me let me go back to the color I got three last questions you know you had one two three four five I guess CEOs or times he has five Executives top Executives of Fillmore's they let businessweek reporter follow them around and write this article should they have done that or not after you read this, sure this is McGraw-Hill this is big business this week is big business is McGraw Health if they think there's money in it to create a story they're not all good to do good is either I mean it was this week's not going to be immediately antagonistic either it's got Little Rock at a much more objective you know made her seem more positive kind of thing, from visit with and they would from Jack no objective where is the reporter objective here, like they're people just like if you live next to an IRS agent what do you what do you do throw a brick through his window no yeah it could be the nicest guy in the world either put a human face on it you know slant to it just from the picture on the cover it just looks silly else have a general expected more favorable article based on the cover or not, unpredictable but it wasn't quite as favorable as I thought it was going to be, business week is pretty young even-handed about most of the things that they do so how do I Fred how do these five of these five people than come across do they come across this is the princes of Darkness or they come across as guys just doing their job typical higher level Executives I think that you would see in any other company to that's what they came across this to me you know like everyone has a part to play, another product they're human beings they are somebody's father and there's somebody son but they're very driven that's why they're where they are and they're going to, to push their would be talking about personal responsibility and I just kind of click that don't these guys have personal responsibility and the job they take I mean we're talking about okay I make this decision to smoke cigarettes well I'm making this decision to sell cigarettes to people and I know it's going to kill hundreds of thousands of people no matter what you do, Andres you know to ameliorate that that's your personal responsibility you've taken out on yourself to push this product don't they have that so they are in a winter bottom line is money yeah that is so personal responsibility I mean we're talking about making personal choices and having to live with it I think a personal response which is their business relationships what they're doing is, you make your choices yes that's basically it that's what I think but they separate their business sense of responsibility from their million other social sensors possibility I don't know one person do that can't really do it but they do, compartmentalize they're doing there this is a job and they look at it as a job and I'm doing it the best I can and it's like I'm working hard regardless of what the consequences are too there's nothing on who wants to know, as long as there is a demand for the product they're supplying it okay their last question in here the five or so Executives point out and the article with a reporter points out some of the things that Philip Morris is doing different now than they used to do no more bro man no Billboards 30,000 clerks train a hundred million dollars in advertising 35:58 countries that they're they're, stop you smoking in or working to stop these noisy all that kind of stuff okay they're out there doing can these guys ever win or just impossible it's down to what they're pushing with the product isn't it's just has so many bad ramifications to it I mean even if I realized what they may want to do was good you know their company but the bottom line is everybody looks and I guess a lot be a part of that too is this last paid only if I get a chance to read it but it's a, write up about an advertising campaign they're investing it yeah that's talking about denying access to cigarettes hey my seen this commercial yeah I did some reading is it something about a bunch of kids a good job buddy, see this commercial all the time and television and it just happens when I turn it on you know it's on there and I don't know but I've taken note to it so therefore you know the week are things to you and I like you didn't see that three years ago or five years ago so you know I think that they do not try but you know they're like you say they're manipulating they're doing you know they're they're they're taking an inch to get a yard and take my could take some one is that they are trying to address on one level, it'll let children smoke and yet they're planting the seed for children to smoke I think that becomes enticing we serve it in a challenge yeah think about it but all the sudden now you're saying don't do it you shouldn't do it you're planning to see to do it and it becomes I mean I see that I could see that it's not maybe your point but it's kind of how I survived yeah I wasn't looking at it kind of a macho taco whole differently and it reminded me of in, children's Pinocchio when the boys were all LED and they were all donkeys because they played up to half the bridge you know if you follow these ads a seaman tasting and cool and sexy and don't smoke I don't smoke who's gonna tell me not to smoke I'm going to smoke it's cool if you think you're Invincible - I guess that's why I took it while I appreciate you should develop cigarettes for kids that are, to get a yarn if you get one kid not to smoke but 100's do because the concept is it's like it's like, you know I don't know I don't have a good analogy but if you keep telling somebody not to do something not to do something to try to change a tire so that other thing you do is get possibly end up in counterproductive and once again goes back to the whole concept of the Prince of Darkness is where you know maybe somewhere on Park Avenue they know a little bit more than we do or the quote-unquote improves the quality of the advertising people I'm quite certain that when I've seen ads, Brilliant Minds to think how can we act as if the subliminal heart out okay guys I'll tell you what you've been great if you and thank you for doing your homework so leave everything you got right in front of you I'm going to pick it up and you have a very simple Task 1 you go back out the door you came in and see the folks on the way out and, they'll pay you your money for for giving me all the good help and then travel safe going on even the prince of the article there please leave everything place, thank you so you can take your names if you want if you want to remember your name, it's always nice refreshing yeah",0.8122028955172415,0.6258128,0.9128387
grhb0039,"ladies and gentlemen the senior vice president of marketing for RJ artist development company David thank you and good morning, as you can see we are all tremendously excited about Premier probably the most talked about eagerly anticipated new cigarette ever, Premier represents an unprecedented opportunity that will even rival the introduction of Winston more than 30 years ago we firmly believe the premier is the first of a new generation of cigarettes that will shape the future of our industry, the dedication the hard work and the plain old sweat of a lot of people in Winston-Salem have made this remarkable product a reality, and now all eyes are on Us sales and marketing to successfully introduced Premiere into the market, Premier represents the biggest technological breakthrough in cigarette history and we intend to Market it as nothing less, now before I tell you about the specifics of our marketing program I'd like to emphasize one key point, the same corporate commitment that is made Premier possible is reflected in the resources dedicated to make this launch a success, in fact the marketing support behind Premier will exceed any new cigarette ever guaranteeing the biggest the most exciting introduction in our company's history, now to put this into perspective we will outspend Marlboro by more than two to one during the launch and I'm sure that you will agree that the marketing elements that you are about to see are dramatic and Powerful tools to capitalize on this one-of-a-kind sales opportunity, with the unique product supported by new and Innovative programs we will be relying heavily on field sales input to optimize our plan we need good information on what's working and what could work better sales and marketing coordination is important with any new brand introduction but it's absolutely Critical with this one, well now for the marketing elements let's first look at the name the name Premier is a great fit for this product Premier literally means first the first of a whole new generation of cigarettes for today's smoker, the package for Premier is also something very special in Consumer Testing the design achieved very high acceptance it exceeded our expectations in communicating the Breakthrough nature of Premier and standing for quality and having broad-based smoker appeal and most important in generating the highest levels of purchase interest, the package is a standard king size box configuration but with a special printed foil over wrap to provide extra moisture protection for the product this high-tech overwrap is unique to Premiere and will further reinforce the brands premium quality and you can see that the carton Graphics effectively translate this exciting design and provide impactful shelf presence for both filter and Menthol styles, well now let's talk pricing, Premier will be priced to achieve a 25 percent premium over standard priced 85 millimeter brands at retail not only is it more expensive to make but we found that smokers expect to pay more for premier, this premium results in an up charge to the consumer of about 30 cents per pack and 275 per carton, all of our marketing elements reflect the value added dimension of the product support equality image and reinforce the technological breakthrough which commands this premium on a national average the retail price for Premier will be a dollar 64 per pack and 1379 per carton prices in both Missouri and Arizona are projected to be comparable to this national average, you know advertising is something that every marketing guy likes to talk about and I'm certainly no exception for mirrors advertising campaign communicates that through the use of innovative new technology Premier is the first cigarette to respond to certain negative perceptions among smokers while still delivering the taste and the satisfaction that smokers demand, our advertising is distinctive to the cigarette industry and it has a newsworthy informational look while maintaining an upbeat and positive tone we have selected the phrase the cleaner smoke as our product positioning because it clearly communicates premiers unique point of difference, very importantly we are not claiming that Premier is a safer cigarette because we do not believe that our current products are unsafe while we don't agree with the claims made about current cigarettes we do take very seriously the controversy which has resulted so we developed Premier to respond to the ever growing pressures confronting today smokers, our media plan guarantees that we will reach virtually every smoker during the launch with this advertising because of our extensive use of magazines newspapers and billboards beginning in mid-september will run a series of pre introductory newspaper ads to announce the new category of cleaner smoke and to build anticipation for the product introduction with the tagline Premier is coming, we will also run pre introductory Billboards and key high traffic locations to build excitement and word-of-mouth around the pending launch, by the week of October 17th when you are achieving broad-scale retail distribution our launch advertising will begin, our initial magazine units are 6 and 4 Page inserts that will run in Major magazines like time Better Homes and Gardens and Sports Illustrated now these units are designed to deliver the full premier advertising message and a very highly impactful and distinctive manner, since we have samples of our advertising for your review after the meeting let me simply summarize the ad copy for you, the introductory message Harold's premiers technological achievement as the first cigarette that heats tobacco rather than burning it the ads convey what this breakthrough means for smokers and those around them specifically a substantial reduction of many of the controversial compounds found in the Smoke of tobacco burning cigarettes smoked the dissipates almost instantly and smoke with a cleaner aroma, what Premier comes down to is cleaner smoke not only for smokers but also for everyone around them but you know we haven't forgotten why people smoke namely taste and enjoyment therefore our ads reinforce the pleasurable aspects of smoking premier, our initial multi-page units will be followed by other four-page units with varying headlines which focus on cleaner smoke and the Breakthrough that it represents, we will also run a number of magazine spreads and full-page newspaper ads to maintain very heavy advertising presence during the launch additionally we will include a question-and-answer booklet with some magazine ads to provide further information about our new cigarette, The Outdoor Advertising that we've created for Premier is dramatic and will generate tremendous presence in your markets the message is simple and straightforward the cleaner smoke new premier a works cited about this advertising because it supports our breakthrough achievement and provides important and unique news to smokers, our introductory campaign generated the highest level of purchase intent of any new RJ our brand advertising ever tested let me tell you something smokers want this product, the bottom line is the advertising is very effective in communicating our message to smokers, well now that you've seen our ads let me tell you about some specifics of our introductory promotions plan, premiers promotion plan is by far the most extensive that we've ever undertaken for a new brand, promotion programs the first of their kind have been developed with four key strategies in mind education acclimation impact and quality education to premieres attributes acclimation to its unique characteristics impact to ensure smoker participation and finally quality to support premiers premium price, all of our promotion programs will carry product information to help educate smokers about premier, smokers will be provided with multiple pack and curtain offers to ensure a sufficient quantity of product to acclimate and switch to Premiere as with any breakthrough product there are some adjustments required by smokers for example Premier has a new cleaner taste a different Aroma and it takes a little longer to light some of you may recall the adjustments required when filters were introduced and later lotar products as you, no today filters represent more than 90% of the market and low tar more than fifty percent, we're confident that one smokers understand premiers attributes consumer acceptance will parallel these earlier industry advances, to achieve the greatest impact priority emphasis has been given to retail promotion furthermore Direct Mail programs are targeted exclusively against competitive smokers to maximize incremental volume and finally every promotion that we've developed carries a very high-quality look to ensure that it's a step above anything else currently out there, to help you dominate the retail environment we have developed the most extensive display program ever conducted on a Reynolds new brand, these specially designed retail displays reinforce the cleaner smoke concept and provide a high-value permanent look, these displays have been set up for your review following the meeting, the displays will showcase our very lucrative introductory offer in October now this offer consists of two free packs with a 2-pack purchase and will also contain an informational brochure a three dollar retail Bearer cheque to encourage repeat purchase a quality butane lighter and a cigarette case that will hold a pack of Premier plus 5 you cigarettes for easy disposal, also at the recommendation of sales planning we have boosted the normal month one quantity to ensure that you have enough promotional product to work with, now one month to we will load our supplemental displays with regular product to coincide with a strong Direct Mail effort that I'll cover in just a moment in month through month 3 we will repeat the by to get two free promotion with the three dollar Bearer cheque now it's particularly important that we educate retailers on the Redemption of Bearer cheques while smokers use them just like coupons they are not coupons their checks that should be cached by the retailer, for immediate payment at Banks importantly we will use the bearer cheques to rapidly generate the names of tires for use and follow-up promotions the checks will also provide immediate feedback on how well our promotion programs are working, to supplement trial building programs at retail product sampling will be conducted in October and November using the premier sampling centers these centers will be positioned in high traffic locations and will deliver product information via brochures and a special video, smokers will be provided with a complimentary sample containing four packs this offer will also contain the same elements as the retail introductory offer I previously described an extremely lucrative free sample, certainly a key promotion for us during launches the targeted Direct Mail program and impactful brochure containing a coupon for a free carton of Premier will be used to maximize trial and conversion among competitive smokers particularly smokers of Philip Morris brands, we will achieve tremendous penetration with this program almost half of all target competitive smokers in the lead markets will receive this free carton offer and in order to promote word-of-mouth advertising and new trial we have developed what we call a direct mail Advocate Program, we have found through consumer tests that there is a core group of smokers out there that have immediate and strong acceptance of the product and these people want to tell their friends about Premier to leverage this Core Group commitment we developed an Innovative program that enables these smokers to give their friends a coupon good for two free packs of premiere, as I'm sure you know the personal endorsement from a friend is one of the most powerful marketing tools available, finally to further consumer understanding product information and instructions for use will be contained in pack on certs and carton inserts that will be included in all product during the test Market, let me add that we will be testing several alternative retail and Direct Mail promotions this will enable us to optimize our plans for later expansions these tests will be reviewed in your breakout meetings but let me re-emphasize the need for feedback from the field on how these programs are working, in summary our extensive promotion plan will ensure tremendous trial and purchase of new premier and support our market share objectives, well as you can see companies support and commitment to Premiere is unprecedented we've developed and will implement the most aggressive marketing program ever undertaken by our Jr, premiers breakthrough achievement and obvious competitive Advantage warrant nothing less, Premier represents the future and we must introduce it accordingly, as I said earlier all eyes are on us now Advocates and foes alike or watching the competition is watching our customers are eagerly awaiting our new cigarette, let's show them that we are indeed the leaders in this industry thank you",0.8652403622580644,0.7325503,0.9128387
gsbg0182,"good morning I would like to take a minute or two to discuss a subject that is vitally important to all of us I'm talking of course about the annual free gift that we send to every TSM, your basic ball and your basic bat or a big hit with the field sales force, and the question that's been keeping us up nights here in New York City is how do we top that, basic boxing gloves no research showed that it's difficult to put up POS materials with these fat thumbs, your basic hard hat it could come in handy when those competitive shears come crashing down but we decided against it, this year we wanted to give you something you could really use and that's why we decided on this watch later on you'll each be getting one of these why because basic and good timing or the subjects of this meeting, before we talk about our present opportunities and our future plans let's revisit the past for a moment, at the beginning of 1994 we thought basic could live with that instant price Gap in fact we discovered that we could live with a much larger price Gap, that Gap is proof positive that every one of you in the field sales force is doing a great job at executing our strategy, your achievement is even more impressive when you consider the tough challenges we faced in 1995 time and time again in 95 you met those challenges you did more than just Prevail against tough odds you excelled, yes we've come a long way in 95 Marlboro is barreling along the tracks with the increasing momentum of marble and limited are other premium brands are showing strength as well, and in the discount category our number two brand basic is doing very well, since January of 95 Basics category Shear is up 1.5 sharepoint's that's terrific especially when you consider that basic is promoted on image and not on price, and now 1995 is behind us it's a new year with new opportunities and new challenges, let me begin 1996 wishing you all a Happy New Year and also by sharing with you some very good news, we are introducing basic and three new king size box packings full flavor lights and full flavor menthol, basic box will be launched nationally over the next four months, that's a big box but then basic box is big news, judging from the number of requests we've had for this packing from you the field sales force I know basic box is going to be a welcome addition to the Philip Morris product line, I also know that some of you may be asking why now why basic box first thing out of the gate in the new year, I'm here to tell you that I'm absolutely convinced that now is the time for basic box, there are four reasons, one take a look at the top 10 brands basic is the only brand in that top 10 without a box packing, nine out of ten top brands all have box that alone sends a very clear message about the right way to go consumers want a box packing, are two major competitors Doral and GPC have box packings however we should note that they don't have box packings and Menthol where they have two strong premium Brands cool and Salem, to now is the right time to introduce a new packing to the discount franchise because the overall discount category is continuing to decline, I'm aware that there are real concerns out there and the argument goes something like this, Dave we're a premium based company we can be very successful focusing on the premium side of the business, aren't you afraid this new packing could in fact generate new discount growth, no the fact is that discount box packings have been growing for the past two years within a total category decline so those fears are ungrounded three now is the time for basic box because even in a shrinking discount category we are growing our share, as I said earlier basic is up 1.5 category Shear points since January, let's not forget that basic is also a major brand its number two in our portfolio only exceeded by the most successful brand in consumer products history more burro, yes we are doing great on the premium side let's use that momentum at retail to make basic and even bigger success, the fact is there are a lot of discount consumers out there who are making purchase decisions based on something other than absolute Rock Bottom price for now is a time for basic box because an absolute sheer Basics performance has been flat we're doing well but Doral and GPC are outpacing us, in a shrinking category these two competitors are growing faster than basic, in other words the introduction of basic box is a smart move for the future as well as for right now, we've been talking about the why of basic box the next question is how how or are we going to launch this brand, with a sound strategy and outstanding execution, a product launch is unique because you only get one shot at doing it right, let's make the most of this terrific opportunity to seize the attention of consumers and pull competitive smokers into the brand, we plan to make the most of our time right now so we can execute with Excellence from the word go, when we talked with their consumers the number one thing they tell us is that they want to find the product everywhere, in other words distribution is key our first priority will be to get distribution the goal we've set for ourselves nationally is 80% of anyone packing, in support of your hard work will be running basic box creative on billboards and magazines during the month of February, as a result we expect consumers to go into the stores and early February asking for the product, during the month of February we will be offering a buy two get one free on all soft packings but not on basic Bots we're not putting box in the February promotion because we want to make everyone we want to make sure that everyone has enough time to get distribution, we'll follow February's promotion with a box specific promotion a buy two get one free for basic box in the first two weeks of March, in addition will be dropping 60 million buy two get one free coupons in newspapers across the country this will introduce basic box to the smoking public, will also drop three million pieces of mail out to both basic and competitive smokers, it's a fact that we've always supported basic 11 to 12 months out of every year now with basic box we are seizing a terrific opportunity to promote the brand like never before, we've all heard the expression time is money, let's make the most of our time these first few months of 1996 so that we can be right on the money with basic box time and time again you have demonstrated an ability to successfully meet new challenges now is it time for all of us to begin to make big things happen for basic box, checking my basic watch I see it's time to turn this over to the host of your meeting who will take you through the specifics of this introduction as it relates to your own sales territory, have a good meeting and good selling",0.875473053148148,0.7370034,0.9128387
gtfb0183,"thank you thanks, Madam do you have any matches no we're out you're out unfortunately we're out, that there is a place down the road where you can get all the matches magazines and everything you want Oh may I have a cup of coffee please you're not out of coffee no we have some coffee yes I'll have a cognac please no have you got some very bizarre no I'll have a sous if you've got it or maybe you're a Seuss, decisions decisions decisions decisions and that's what's called consumer Choice why do people choose a certain brand like a lot of things it's not as simple as you think I am that is are not simple but I'm not complicated yes you are you're very complicated for instance you're made up of 27 different elements and you've got more brain cells than there are stars in space familiar things often turn out to be much more complicated than you imagine, that's fascinating you seem to know an awful long time would you have rather might take these cigarettes for instance have you ever thought how complex a pack of cigarettes he has no the wrapping reflects heat and acts as a gas barrier to keep oxygen and water vapor out Aroma and freshness in the stiff pack is a mechanical barrier to prevent damage and then there's a cigarette, out there in Richmond Virginia Philip Morris have a huge modern research and development organization employing five hundred scientists covering every aspect of tobacco Science and Technology like analysis of tobacco the chemistry and physics of smoke Research into flavors and filter materials and design of new processes for better use of tobacco materials,and there's another research and development center in Switzerland agnosia tell run by Philip Morris Europe why well sign shouldn't work in a vacuum ideas grow from the people they serve the customers, well there are local markets and opportunities in Europe that are different from America, local regulations May create technical problems calling for new products and methods of production and there are local tastes and preferences what appeals to one country may not appeal to another though nowadays people are swinging more and more towards the well-known International brands of cigarettes, but even then cigarettes are manufactured locally in Europe and the ingredients are not only tobacco but paper filters blue inks and flavors all the things that make up a pack of cigarettes have to be monitored to maintain quality and consistency, have you ever thought what happens when you smoke a cigarette yes it's very enjoyable, there's more to it than you think the customer buys a cigarette butt consume smoke it's rather like making tea, well you need second operator some methods to obtain a satisfactory end result with skill and attention to detail you can blend all the ingredients in different subtle ways to get results which are aesthetically appealing as well as tasting nice the cigarette is a subtle piece of mechanical and thermodynamic engineering it consists basically of a porous paper tube containing a loose, Lynette Rod of organic material that is tobacco which will burn at a constant rate producing enough heat to release its constituent compounds, a lot of research and developments work is concerned with cigarette technology how the various elements interact with a cigarette is smoked when you light a cigarette and puff a whole sequence of events begins you draw air through the burning cone which Rises to a temperature of 900 degrees Centigrade at the highest temperature everything is burnt but two centimeters away the tobacco temperature is hardly above room temperature, at the lower temperatures Vapors are released producing Aroma and taste between 250 and 400 degrees less volatile substances are converted by a process called pyrolysis into Vapors which mostly condense into tiny droplets you see these as smoke, while traveling from the hot to the cool end gases Escape From The Smoke through the paper and air is drawn in mixing with the droplets and aromatic Vapors to arrive at the tip as cool mainstream smoke at the end of the puff the temperature of the burning comb falls back to about 600 Degrees and the whole system ticks over releasing sidestream smoke waiting for the process to be repeated, in the western world or commercial tobacco is descended from a plant called La Cocina to back mmm once it's harvested there are different methods of curing the tobacco well outside in the air or sun or in curing barns heated with hot air through flues, Modern cigarette length are made from four basic types of tobacco right Virginia tobacco medium life-sized and flue-cured forming the bulk of every cigarette, Bernie large leave Dan are cured, Maryland closely related to Burley tobacco's very popular in parts of Europe and also are cured, and Oriental tobacco which is much smaller leaved cured in the Sun and highly aromatic of course tobacco is a natural crop affected by natural hazards but customers expect every pack of their chosen brand to taste the same European cigarettes are made from 30 or so varieties of tobacco from all over the world samples are taken from each Consignment and distributed to the Laboratories so that chemical characteristics all flavors can be analyzed in order, to serve as a basis for well-defined blending, hand-rolled cigarettes from each lot will be Smoked by experts feel sense of taste is as highly developed as wine tasters,in the laboratory the tobacco is ground to powder and subjected to chemical analysis to find out its dominant characteristics, the samples can be analyzed in many different ways in tobacco and smoke chemistry for example Philip Morris pioneered the use of gas chromatography that sounds very complicated it's a method of separating a mixture of compounds which can be vaporized into its various constituents it consists quite simply of a very fine coiled tube usually made of glass or stainless steel which has a pure carrier gas flowing through it constantly and at a precisely controlled temperature, distributed throughout the coil you have a porous adsorbent at one end you inject the liquid mixture of compounds this vaporizes immediately in the Heat and the vapor is carried by the gas through the coil, since each of the constituents of the mixture has different chemical and physical properties some will be more slow down by the adsorbent than others, so they move through the coil at different speeds, so you squirt the mixture in at one end and by the intensity of the signal given off by each compound at the other end you can read off the different constituents, the automatic smoking machine was designed and built by Philip Morris in the United States the chemical composition of smoke mustn't change over time in a cigarette which is very difficult to maintain in a natural product so every blend component has to be tested to find out what it will contribute, smoke compounds from the machine are trapped on a filter subsequently weighed transferred into solution and analyzed by the machine automatically, the Auto Analyzer uses classical chemistry but automate the various steps for instance you take a series of samples inject them into the system where they are separated by bubbles then you add a reagent which colors the substance you want to detect the samples are pumped through a detector to measure the degree of coloration which is proportional to the concentration at the end of the sequence there's an automatic printer show, the percentage of the substance nicotine or whatever that you want to measure, then there's the flavor kitchen the flavor Kitchen yes well the most markets flavors are added to the tobacco to highlight certain characteristics like adding spice to food, you'd be surprised at the number of delicious things they put into most cigarettes chocolate licorice sugar and honey to complement the tobacco's natural Aroma and taste the solution of mainly sweet ingredients which is added hot at the beginning of tobacco preparation is called casing whereas Aroma top notes added towards the end after the cutting of the tobacco are called after cut flavors and of course these ingredients have to be checked constantly for Purity and strength before they are mixed with the Blended tobacco, the factory they're all natural ingredients from different parts of the world so there's subject variables, quality control is continuous if the samples tested don't reach very exact standards a whole batch may be rejected, once the quality of the ingredients is approved they can be introduced into the tobacco, each brand has its own special recipe which is a closely guarded secret and some Brands don't contain any additives, mass production methods have been brought to a high level of Technology over the years but there will always be room for improvements which reminds me there's also a department called process development they generate new ideas for processing the tobacco, what to do with tobacco fines and stems for instance, it's quite a bit left over in the manufacturing process or perfectly good tobacco so they've developed process for reconstituting these ingredients into homogenized sheet, leading in turn to the development of new Machinery to manufacture the product on an industrial scale so that it can be blended into the rest of the tobacco since this reconstituted tobacco sheet has been modified to exclude natural deficiencies its introduction actually improves the blend as well as making economic sense and every little saving helps particularly when you think that at the factory at measure tell alone they manufacture 17 million cigarettes a day,as you said cigarettes aren't only made of tobacco right look at the paper for instance that's a whole different story there are many different sorts of paper with different characteristics, constant checks are made on all the materials the whiteness of the paper its Purity porosity burning rate and strength, and of course the glues and inks used in printing and packaging all have to be tested as well it's very important when high speed machines are producing 100 cigarettes a second, and when it's finished products have passed every quality control samples are tested again in the Laboratories to make sure that no Faults have got through but in the final analysis there is no substitute for the human touch, one point I haven't mentioned is the filter do you know how a Filter Works yes I think so well you probably don't it sound like a sieve which stops all substances over a certain size from passing through a well-designed cigarette filter should have a selective filtering effect covering the whole range of smoke constituents the basic white filter is really a bundle of cellulose acetate fibers wrapped in paper which is more or less porous according to design, smoke is an aerosol composed of various gases aromatic Vapors and condensed droplets a proportion of these droplets are attracted by capillary action to the fibers and the gas is an aromatic Vapors are largely unaffected, cuz I know they've been experimenting with filters for a long time yes I know but nowadays they've developed beyond the basic white filter the research department for instance is developing granular filters further in detail cigarette smoke can be broken down into eight percent aromatic Vapors eight percent organic substance in droplets an 84% are the gases the biggest proportion being nitrogen from the air the more sophisticated filters contain granules with especially, activated porous surface which can capture a specific part of the volatile organic materials contained in the vapors according to required taste so that none of the smokes constituents become dominant the most sophisticated filters combine a mechanical White Fiber filter and mixtures of activated granules to produce a balanced smoke, the research Department studies amongst other things the whole field of adsorbent materials that are mainly active on the volatile Vapor phase, the aim is to produce an efficient filter which ensures that the same time a proper balance of taste the problem is if you reduce one element another element may become dominant perhaps affecting The Taste activated charcoal one of the most effective absorbance whether it's very large surface area and micro porous structure is selected for volatile components which may have a sharp taste the research Department uses Advanced scientific methods in their work, which involves the basic constituents of cigarette technology tobacco smoke additives that's to say everything else that goes into a cigarette and they've got a lot of sophisticated machines to help them thus automatic for instance automatically gathers data on pore size and poor distribution of absorbance for filter cigarettes they must have collected an awful lot of information by now you're absolutely right well there are, you two terminals through our D which are linked to a data processing center, all relevant information not only from our D itself but from available sources anywhere in the world is stored in a library staff by specialists in information storage and retrieval it's instantly available to any of the Departments when the forms of books journals reprints and visual display, I've told you about quality control about process development and the research Department there's one honor Department initiative product development, they drawn all the information made available by the other departments and dream up new concepts of their own which they store away for the future or offer to the marketing department, on the other hand the marketing people frequently request a specific new product or alterations to existing ones, this can range from changing a filter design to creating an entirely new cigarette brand,a change which might appear to be simple such as altering filter length by a millimeter move dozens of different experimental cigarettes being produced and tested because you may have to adapt the tobacco blend cigarette paper or other ingredients to compensate for the change, but however many machines you may use to test the quality of tobacco in the construction of cigarettes in the end there is only one way of deciding if you like a cigarette smoke yes, as I said before the customer buys a cigarette butt consumes smoke smoking a cigarette is rather like drinking tea apart from the purely aesthetic gratification the look and the aroma and taste there are measurable responses such as pulse rate and skin temperature so you find out how people smoke, ultimately you can forget all about the machines and simply let people smoke and give their opinions, the final decisions about cigarettes are really made by a smoking panel of people drawn from the leaf Department of Philip Morris Europe, they decide if a cigarette is worth smoking they look for those subtle quality characteristics which can't be chemically analyzed, as a routine quality control they test smoke whenever a new batch of ingredients is introduced into production looking particularly for Taste and flavor character but the smoking panel is also the final judge of new products the ultimate aim in producing any brand of cigarettes is to maintain consistency of character from one pack to another from the first puff to the last, research and development can show how to achieve this, well there you are that's more or less all I can tell you about research and development but you could always go and find out for yourself if you're interested they take people on conducted tours you'll find they really care about cigarettes, anyway I told you there was a lot more to a pack of cigarettes than meets the eye but how do you know all this my husband works there, but I wanted to talk to you, you know you have a cigarette I never knew the thrill of life until I touch your, just like a cigarette now seem to fade away and believe this and with a flash of your fingertips it was easy for you to forget",0.8728598570270273,0.6389672,0.9128389

came up to the Yankees as playing with Kansas City in the American Association in 1915 and joined the Yankees in July 1950 were you always a picture, well I was the first baseman high school but I wasn't I didn't think I was too big enough to play first base so they change me to a pigeon you bitch for high school that's right well like so many people I see you're a camel smoker Whitey tell me what do you like about him, well I like animals they have a wonderful flavor and I think they're very mild you like them to fans today try Camel cigarettes,here's a shortstop who can go get him for you the Phils granny Hamner Ronnie tell me what club are you with before you joined the Phillies well I played in Philly before I was ever played in a modeling then they sent married and forty five and seven to Utica New York in the eastern league did you always play shortstop always except for a short run of second baseman animal bourbon sprained his ankle and 48 would you want to be in short them second much rather or granny, let's move over to another League cigarettes why did you change the camels and I look for enjoyment of cigarette and camels has given me plenty of and enjoyable flavor what do you like most about them just that entry-level flavor you find many ballplayers smoking camels granny yes you do most of our players I know this must come find out what you been missing fans smoke only camels for 30 days from my illness and flavor camels agree with more people than any other, other cigarette, it's the greatest vote of confidence in cigarette history latest published figures show camels 43% ahead of the second place for and 54% ahead of the third one hundred and forty-four percent ahead of the fourth find out why Try camels today, it's the greatest vote of confidence in cigarette history latest published figures show camels 43% ahead of the second place brand 54% ahead of the third one hundred and forty four percent ahead of the fourth find out why Try camels today, you know when one brand of cigarettes gets to be far more popular than any other you can be pretty sure it's got something special to offer I want you to look at some comparisons based on the latest published figures these lines represent the fourth third and second most popular cigarettes in America and now here's number one America's First Choice camels 43 percent more camels were smoked in enjoyed during the year then the second place brand, D 4 percent more than the third and one hundred and forty four percent more than the fourth America smokers give camels the greatest vote of confidence in cigarette history now what if camels got that the others haven't why are camels so far out front there must be a reason and it's this camels have more costly tobacco's the exclusive

Paul has this report, when Minnesota began this anti-smoking campaign in 1986 it was aimed chiefly a teenagers about 1 in 5 teens smoke cigarettes today remember smoking is just as a natural for you as it is for them, even though it's declined sharply among adults the teen smoking rate has held steady for the past decade experts say the traditional messages emphasizing Health consequences or death simply haven't worked for young people, Sunshine Dayglo began smoking four years ago when she was 12 she just moved to st. Paul from a small town and all her friends she says seem to be smoking I think it was being new in town and you always find some way to click in with your friends and it had been just normal like you dress a certain way or you find things that kind of are easy an easy Outlet to get in you know be accepted with your friends and whatever, I'm an honor student Sunshine Dayglo says she's well aware of smoking's adverse consequences but intelligence and even a mild asthma problem aren't enough to overcome the Habit one that her mother Kathy back cell says began because of peer pressure and teenage rebellion my mother smoked and so I thought that my rebellion was to not smoke and no now we've skipped a generation and now he's rebelling by smoking why do wrong and whatever the cause experts say the earlier in life, if a person decides to smoke the tougher it becomes later to quit people who start smoking in college for example find it much easier to take the Habit so in addition to urging kids not to smoke anti-smoking campaigns have also tried to prevent them from buying cigarettes in the first place our say what I mean it more difficult for me to buy them because then I met would have stopped and thought about it you know before, I knew what I was getting into, to make it more difficult for young people to buy cigarettes many states are considering a ban on vending machines which allow many children easy access to cigarettes it's a move endorsed at the federal level by Health and Human Services secretary dr. Louis Sullivan the tobacco industry has joined vendors in opposing the ban spokesman walk a merryman notes that despite very tight restrictions on alcohol sales underage drinking is widespread two-thirds of high school students are, drinkers only about 14% are regular smokers so the issue of access it seems to me simply doesn't play into this at all how old are you 15 holy smoke inertia despite industry opposition the Saint Paul suburb of White Bear Lake band the machines this year it has launched one of the toughest crackdowns on underage smoking in the nation police regularly arrest and put, through smoking cessation classes any minor caught in the act this goes to our juvenile officer okay and what you'll do is mail a letter out your parents within two weeks and your parents are going to be required to come down and visit with the juvenile officer what what what because it's illegal to smoke under the age 18 in the state of Minnesota despite the Crackdown it's not difficult for kids in White Bear Lake to buy or smoke cigarettes they can simply go to a neighboring Community for, example like st. Paul there we followed Sunshine Day go one recent afternoon to this gas station recording her conversation and purchased with a concealed wireless microphone although Minnesota recently enacted the strictest penalties in the nation up to three thousand dollars anyone caught selling to minors of 15 year old female can purchase cigarettes about six times out of 10 according to a, diversity of Minnesota study dr. Gene Forrester of the University of Minnesota School of Public Health says most police departments don't see Teen smoking as an urgent priority we had a police team at one time tell us you know nobody nobody dies from cigarettes well that's a blatantly wrong but what he means nobody's dying they're not teenagers dying today from cigarette he's clearly used to dealing with issues that have a more immediate impact, recall any of them we went back to the st. Paul gas station a few minutes after Sunshine Day gloated nineteen-year-old attendant denied he told her cigarettes he said he regularly checks the idea Penny one who appears under 18 that bitch but then I say it's a compliment if they're all nothing Hearts compliment you ever feel pressured at all, and embarrassed to ask people for ID sometimes like if it's a nice-looking girl what are you doing those cases kind of asked shyly it's not just retail clerks who asked shyly on the matter of teen smoking however experts say many parents are reluctant to resist their teenage smokers I don't like it and I let her know I don't like it but I guess I know there are bigger issues, in her life right now that if I put a lot of negative energy and making her quit smoking she's may just rebelling other areas that they could have a worse impact on her life the fact that parents go along with their children's decision to smoke is demoralizing to anti-smoking Advocates but Kathy Xcel says in her mind there are many worse things her daughter could engage in I'm really concerned about her sexual activity alcohol addiction would be another concern I have, the use of drugs and substances that are, more immediately harmful than cigarettes might be to her body and grades in college and those kinds of issues are are certainly more pressing right now and that that if there can be a bad back burner issue I think it's smoking as anti-smoking Advocates trouble to keep their issue on the front burner and estimated 3,000 teenagers each day starts smoking cigarette sales to minors bring in over 1 billion dollars a year in profits, to the tobacco industry and ironically even more money in excise tax revenue to government",0.8491557771428573,0.71282685,0.9128387

gyhb0039,"adorable aren't they hi I'm Barbara my husband Bill thinks I'm crazy putting these here but I just tell him oh well the world's a crazy place and you know it's never crazier than when you were smoker take the other day I was taking a smoke break it work gaining a, outside of course my office building I was on the street when suddenly out of nowhere this this man runs up to me and says no smoking near that building there I was shocked I mean there was two million cubic feet of air out there now I know radical but enough is enough I'm a smoker I like smoking and I'm getting just a tad tired of people who want to make, my choice their choice it's almost like smoking has become a pain these days instead of a pleasure but you know there is a way we smokers can free ourselves to enjoy the things we like about smoking, it's this Eclipse by Vantage in regular and menthol, first thing I notice about eclipses you get a great taste nice draw and full-bodied satisfying smoke Bingo the smoke disappears about as fast as you can say thank you for not smoking and there's almost no smoke at the lid end added all up in what do you get an incredible new cigarette with super taste and nearly 90% less secondhand smoke to write on the back 90%, that's a nice number especially when you're sharing life's journey with a nonsmoker like my husband Bill oh and check this out Eclipse leaves your curtains walls Windows even your teeth a lot cleaner than other cigarettes observe you know I've just redecorated and now with the clips is practically nothing to stay in these Priceless Treasures, it's wild who would think that a cigarette could let us cut down on secondhand smoke without cutting down on satisfaction and guess what it's not just smokers like us who are crazy about eclipses people who don't smoke are raving about it too like Bill, now when we're together all that lingers in the air is my witty conversation but seriously that's what's so fabulous about eclipses there's almost no secondhand smoke almost no smoke from the lid end practically no staining no lingering odor and no ashes you heard right no ashes because Eclipse doesn't burn down as we'll talk about later so now I don't need an ashtray every two feet anymore what to do with all those extra, ashtrays stunning isn't it and now bill says all I smell like is my perfume a simple yet intriguing blend of Jasmine and free-range wildflowers and I ask you which would you rather have in your house this or this an ashtray of finished Eclipse yep that's what they look like after you've smoked them instant clean my favorite kind not that I don't underst grubbing dirty ashtrays, somehow you'll learn to do without it before we go one step further I gotta show you this okay you already know Eclipse has no ashes because it doesn't burn down as I mentioned so what's this Eclipse can lie flat on the table without leaving any burn marks so if your cigarette accidentally falls out of the ashtray it's less likely to burn your table carpet or your clothes well that's good news for shirts slacks soap is in car seats All Over America, hmm one thing to remember though Well there's almost no smoke at the lid and the tip is still hot so you be careful guys how does it Clips do all this let me tell you I wondered myself but actually it's simple let's go to the videotape from RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company the folks who created eclipse eclipse primarily Heats tobacco instead of burning it that's the basis for its many benefits it has made much like any other cigarette with a special difference at it made from hi, Purity carbon this tip is wrapped in an insulating heat barrier that keeps the tobacco roll from burning down the rest of eclipses just like other cigarettes a blend of fine tobacco followed by a regular cigarette filter that's how it's made how does it work r.j. Reynolds as you smoke your eclipse the heat barrier keeps the tobacco roll from burning down inside the cigarette instead when you draw warm air passes over the tobacco getting a just hot enough to, create a full-bodied smoke it carries the flavor of the tobacco with it let's put it in English the way Eclipse works is something like making coffee when you pour the hot water all the flavors release from the grounds the ground is still there when you finish but all the flavors gone so yet us them when you're done guys don't toss your clip still it seems cool down mention Eclipse taste, tinkle body but it's super low and tar nicotine no well let's hear all about it from the folks at r.j. Reynolds themselves based on Government testing methods full flavor cigarette Styles range between 15 and 20 milligrams of tar Lifestyles between 6 and 14 and ultralights between 1 and 5 mg but Eclipse which primarily Heats rather than Burns tobacco is three milligrams in its full flavor style and to in its mild style for, nicotine full flavor cigarettes typically range between point eight and one point seven milligrams of nicotine lights range between .6 and .9 and ultralights range between point 1 and point five but eclipses nicotine level is just point to mg in its full flavor and point one and it's mild style and that's our math lesson for today seriously here's the bottom line Eclipse taste great is ultra low and tar and nicotine, the smoke disappears super fast and there's a huge reduction in secondhand smoke why how it's because the clip smoke is different from other cigarettes smoke particles from other cigarettes are about 20% of water and glycerin put Eclipse Smoke is the reverse about 80% water and Glycerine glycerine is something found in all cigarette smoke as well as many food products and baked goods the smoke is mostly water and glycerin there's almost no, poke off the lid and so no wonder there's so little secondhand smoke but is there anything in the Smoke of an eclipse that isn't in other cigarettes nope just more water and glycerin that's why all I smell are the flowers and why clip smoked a super smooth and disappear super fast just like I used to have to whatever I this cigarette of course the real deal is Eclipse is a little different at first oh yes it is a real cigarette it's a great tasting real, cigarette it's not a cigarette alternative or any of that kind of stuff but you do sort of have to get used to it in the beginning but for me that's all part of discovering something so new and wonderful all right then let's give it a whirl first and foremost we need a good strong flame when you light it get you the car lighter you need a direct flame and you need to take an extra puffer to when you light it that's because you lighting the carbon tip not the tobacco, now you already know Eclipse has no ashes because it doesn't burn down like your cigarette does that mean Eclipse doesn't last as long no way eclipse last just as long as my old cigarette about six or seven minutes I know I timed, another thing I discovered with the cliffs the best flavor comes from regular gentle pops now if you let it sit for a while the tip make cool down but not so worried and extra pop will get it going again and when you start getting less smoke and The Taste gets weaker that's how you know your Clips is just about done, there's no question about it Eclipse really is a whole new world for a smoker's now some of the great things like no ashes he discover right away others we appreciate after a while like one day maybe you take out your favorite sweater for me it's the one I was wearing when Bill proposed and guess what no cigarette odor or you walk into the house and it smells clean and fresh or you in your car smoking a Clifton you realize, wow I'm smoking with the windows up I didn't even notice here's another thing you'll discover the freedom you have when you smoke an eclipse so now I can't end the My Little Darlings without being tied to an ashtray but you know you really won't see how great a Clips can be if you keep smoking your old Bram so hang with the clips exclusively for a week or so and you'll see the difference would I, Barbara steer you wrong but you don't have to take my word for it listen to this okay when I first took the eclipse home I said you are not going to believe this cigarette well this is what I wanted this is exactly what I was hoping for there was just no smoke lingering in the air it was just unbelievable I took it close to work and I took it down to our smokers room and the other smokers in the room were amazed, with the cliffs I can smell my wife's perfume or whatever she might be cooking at night I don't see you having to paint once a year the inside of your house because it's getting yellow to me is reduction of the tar and nicotine in the cigarette is by far one of the best reasons is more enjoyable than a regular cigarette that's the honest truth when I smoke let's it makes me feel free to enjoy, my cigarette without offending the non-smokers I would say would definitely be one of the only Innovative cigarettes I've ever heard of well that's the story about an incredible new cigarette called eclipse and incredible new cigarette that gives you all the pleasure of smoking without all the secondhand smoke, there's no lingering odor almost no stains no ashes and low low tar and nicotine all in a full-body smoke with super taste who knows with Eclipse Bibby marriages All Over America will get better maybe it'll be the dawn a new day of Harmony across this great land maybe chocolate will spin your lies okay so that was a little overboard truth is it will always be people out there who won't, like that cigarette in your hand period but for the people you like the people you want to be around for you eclipse is a real step forward well I could go on and on but I don't have to aren't you lucky because you've got a fact-filled brochure that came with this video it talks about eclipses in more detail and answers the most commonly asked questions check it out it's short and informative like mate well it's time to say adios just when you thought you couldn't get enough, funny but hey you can always call the folks at r.j. Reynolds whenever you want just pick up a phone when you have questions or just want to share your thoughts about how great Eclipse really is the call is free so give him a shout, and hey tell them Barbers engine they just love me down there surgeon general's warning smoking causes lung cancer heart disease emphysema and they complicate pregnancy",0.8569523993103447,0.75848067,0.91283906

and a summary of our achievements and our future challenges and opportunities and now I will turn the meeting over to Bill Campbell our Executive Vice President of marketing built thank you Fred progress is defined by Webster as forward or onward movement although this meaning suits our purposes we'll we primarily chose it as art, a theme for its Dynamic nature in today's marketing environment progress in the cigarette business isn't decided merely by momentum or side although we have achieved sales share and profit leadership we remain dedicated to include improving both our strategic and tactical marketing the strengthening our Market position on a macro level 1985 was largely a successful year, property continued their Superior growth while unit sales and market share grew and a shrinking market place however sales and share growth did not reach historical levels in 1985 therefore we must look critically at our results in detail this examination reveals some areas where we successfully met our objectives somewhere we are stabilizing or Shoring up our position somewhere we missed them, work and some were the jury is still out I will highlight these four areas now and a labor elaborate on them later in the hour our complete success Mentor who has played both Grandpa move eyes and unit sales and market share and both Brands benefit from a permissible contributions by line extensions closely take the second area we are working, going to stabilize weaknesses in Merit and Benson & Hedges we have subjected both Brands to rigorous analysis and are implementing new marketing program to further stabilize our overall business we are building competitive positions in the growing price value segment and its sales and Merchandising, we are committed to turning a major factor in these two areas we entered the price value category last year with the test marketing and subsequent National Rollout of players like 25 we are also entering into direct competition with generics and Darrell using our Cambridge trademark, turning to sales and Merchandising p.m. USA has made a long-term commitment to retail leadership in the cigarette system, three of those urgent issues facing p.m. USA during the next five years or addressing the imbalance of current part of our market share and share of inventory securing adequate she'll present and reducing out of stars, we have recently expanded and reorganize our Field Force and built up our in-store merchandising with new cigarette cartons and package fixtures and related retail payment programs, well we have had some significant successes we continue to substantially leg or if they are in retail Domino's our challenge for the future the third area for close examination is the medical business where we continue to fall short of our goal the under status Factory 17 percent share of the Menthol segment has been a perennial problem for p.m. USA we have not been able to successfully launch, a competitive non Learning Station menthol, the last area is the area where results are not final the jury is still out but two brains now in test markets Concord and dugdale is the unique cigarette that allows the smoker to dial these tourist flavor load done you know you can upscale entry with an international heritage, both Concord and DuckTales are showing pockets of strength and weakness currently we're adjusting our marketing strategy in light of the Brand's performances and consumer research I will talk it for the length about our new products towards the end of this presentation at this time I'd like to introduce John Zoeller director of market research who will review the current market trade John will be followed by Robert, Ellenberger do our group directors of brand management before John starts I would like to indicate that we're having some Murphy's laws problems join us pray everything that is going wrong we're having a few problems but we'll just carry on the continent the show is intact the computer has unfortunately let us down at a rather crucial moment so we'll carry on its fight, and rock a rehearsal and we have a video tapes of equipment we have video tapes of this morning's rehearsal sales trends for the industry of Philip Morris, first let's briefly examine the industry's performance, the final months of 1985 shipments were erratic due to the uncertainty surrounding the sun setting of the 16th a pack Federal excise tax this situation was temporarily resolved in late December that the tax was extended March 15 1986, at about the same time Street instituted a price increase, the counter balancing effect these two events than a small additional trade inventory accumulation, nevertheless total shipments fell five billion units to 595 billion in 1985 this was a loss of point eight percent, analyzing the industry's Dynamics while the adult population has been growing about 1.1 percent annually smoking incidents and consumption per day continue to decrease slightly, the overall impact is a reduction in retail sales, consumer sales as measured by Nielsen we're down about 1% last year's low and this rate of decline is expected to continue in the near term, now we'll take a look at Philip Morris, the 1985 p.m. sales had a record two hundred thirteen point six billion 2 billion units over 1984, Philip Morris USA is consistent progress over the years is besting comparison to competition, our 1985 sales volume increased of 2 billion units contrast with the loss of seven billion incurred by all the other companies combined in the past five years we have grown 22 billion views while competition has fallen forty four billion how did each company do last year, in 1985 r.j. Reynolds had a 31.9 market shift which was a point three improvement over the previous year Gretel share growth was entirely due to Durrell which has become the lowest price cigarette on the market in fact without Durrell or Jr with experience to share loss during the past several years Reynolds has been trading high-margin volume for low-margin quality, 1983 is price value brands of grown 8 billion units, while it's full price entries have followed six billion this full price loss has occurred despite spending an estimated 425 million on couponing merchandising and sales promotion activities, for the first time in four years Ron and Williamson enjoyed a here game, it's 11.8 market share was they have Shear Point Advance over 1984 BMW is value entries including their generic private label line and Richland 25 were responsible for the sheer increase, however every full price BMW brand suffered losses since 1983 the BMW price value entries grew 11 billion but it's full price Brands drop 10 billion years, lick it dropped from a 5.7 marketshare 1984 24.9 this year it's older brands are still losing ground and look it's generics feel a new competitive pressure 4.0 23.4 share, for large 8.0 Shear was slightly under its 1984 level while Newport remains a strong performer its gains were unable to compensate for the losses of Kent and the rest of the Lord Lyon, American followed the downward Trend it's been on for over 20 years and slip point four to seven and a half share, other Carlton was unchanged the other American brands declined, the 1985 Philip Morris USA extended its trend of annual market share increases p.m. hit a record share 35.9 the point six year game with the largest of any cigarette company, while our shared growth is lower than in recent years it's still notable as it was accomplished without substantial participation in the low price low-margin cycle, now I'd like to recap 1985 most significance Marketplace development, the low tourist with the 49 share showed virtually no growth in the full flavors with the 45 shared of also level the only lotar Brands to show any upward movements for the price value of packing and our own Marlboro Lights, the ultra-low Taurus is stabilized at 10% of the total Market, of the 20 leading Brands 1985 only five displayed by tally, Barbara continue to improve its number one position which points nine market share game Newport remains robust and headache point or share Advanced Virginia Slims at a point to share hit among the lower price Brands both derail and BMW generics at share gains a point eight, 72 the brand leaders were basically collect plus or minus 1/10 Bashir points remaining Brands were done between point 2 and point seven led by liggett's generic decline, as has been true for some time the success rate of new freestanding cigarette brands is extremely low in 1984 1985 11 new brands were introduced into test Market, three of these all price value entries when nationally, many of the others have already been withdrawn from the market and none of those remaining in test markets currently justifies the National Rollout, indeed among the 12 new brands nationally long since 1980 16 have curved market shares greater than half point with one exception every one of these brands of the price value entry the sole exception Berkeley has been declining systems introduction, foremost Marketplace development of 1985 and the past several years has been the vigorous expansion of the price value segments, this category consists of the lowest price generic brands including No-Frills Brands and store brain for several years Liggett was the only major suppliers products, amid 1984 Brian Williams and launched a competing line of generics, an orgy of rentals reposition Darrell as a generic entry, by December 1985 severe competition cause the generic price brand to sell for two dollars and seventy cents less per Carton and full priced ones, collectively they had a 6.0 market share which was a game at one point to SharePoint, Doral which sells about 50% of its volume of money off coupon has been showing the most growth, the second major price value components to the value 25s these brands are consumers interested in brand name quality as well as cost savings, pedals introduce Century in mid-1983 that was followed by Run & Williamson's Richmond in June 1985 and by Philip Morris is players like 25 and December, the value 25 is achieved a 1.3 market share, in some in 1985 the entire price value category including the generic price and the value 25 entries reached a market share 7.3 1.7 share points, although this segment size and growth are oppressive profitability is low, The Sixteen dollar and fifty cent per thousand profit margins for the full price brands for exci be estimated as all are 52 270 margins of the generics however the value 25 do have respectful margins of between 750 and 11:45, the growth of the price value segment is taking its toll on the full price of brain from 1982 to 1985 price value brand volume grows from 6 billion to forty three billion units at the same time the full price brand declined nearly 65 billion to five hundred fifty two billion units, first it is extremely difficult for any full price brand to show growth, a secret company's performance traditionally has been measured on market share, but with the greater importance of the price value segments along but it's lower profitability other performance criteria must be examined, each company 1985 market share has already been discussed, this differs from each company share of the full price segments, notice that while Philip Morris is a 35.9 market share is 38.5 shareable price segment at The Other Extreme Liggett has a four point nine market share but only a one and a half full price year, marketing expenditure strategies as well as multiple price levels can dramatically affect business comparisons, if we look in detail at only the tube leading cigarette companies, is Phillip Morris has 53 percent of the combined unit sales versus Reynolds 47, our 54 percent of the combined revenues reflects the fact that Reynolds has more low-priced business a major reversal occurs when we look at marketing expenditures r.j. Reynolds substantially I spend Philip Morris and Merchandising and coupon, consequently p.m. accounts for only forty four percent of marketing expenditures, in terms of operating income to spread between ourselves and rentals were right, as a result of favorable price mix and lower marketing expenditures USA enjoyed 62% of the two companies operating income of course one of the primary reasons for the difference in the various performance measures between our sales and rentals is moral growth, Robert Roper route brand director will highlight the Brand's 1985 activities and accomplishments like John bulbar oh Philip Morris USA Flagship Fred continue to strong growth expanded its International industry dominance in 1985 the brand grew by 4.3 billion units to a hundred and thirty-three point three billion units an increase of 3.4% this increases Market, here by nearly a full SharePoint 22.4 while the full flavor packings provided the foundation for the brand it was mobilized to continue to provide spectacular growth, moreover red unit sales for virtually flat 7 e 1 billion units Muldrow 100's posted a slight loss of 260 million years however because of the industry declined their combined share with us almost a tenth of a SharePoint, at the same time the mall Borough lights packings were up dramatically by the 4.6 billion units or 11.9% while market share proved a test sharepoint's 27.4 this performance makes it by far the largest daily loads our brand moreover is the largest selling brand in the industry continue to widen its Lee over its nearest competitors but as the continued strength and vitality all the components of walbro that both, so well for the future of the brand, Mulberry is the leading brand in each of the categories in which it competes full flavor hundreds and lotar beyond that Mulder is the largest selling brand among men among women and among Hispanic smokers and it sure continues to grow in each of these categories, in addition mole per share is increasing and every age group the brand is increased the share dramatically among smokers in the 18 to 24 segment to 47 percent but it's improving shareholder smokers means that the brand is keeping us consumers as they age both Trends are predictors of a continued growth of the franchise, Moltres extraordinary growth over the years is no accident has been firmly founded in Santa Barbara timing Innovative promotions and line extensions that continue to provide consumers with reasons to try them all over let's look at how each of these elements is working combination are one extension strategy has been clear expand the brand at the growing segments of the market building the pond adding to the strength of the total Wahlberg family, in 1967 it was longer late cigarettes with Marlboro 100's in 1971 it was low tar with Muldrow lights, I'm over 25% reduction in January 1985 was based on the same successful line extension strategy our advertising for 25 was consistent with the mail per image that was designed to have stopping power in keeping with our heritage of offering only the highest quality products bulbar 25 was positioned as a convenience not an economy off consumers were charged 25 percent more than five extra cigarettes, the results of them over 25% reduction follow our previous line extension experience the brand generated 3.8 billion units and sales and chief six-tenths of a SharePoint first year of its introduction, to ensure that more were 25 realized its full potential increasing retail distribution and inventory our top priorities for this year, our line extension activity on Walter I helps the brand maintain its Competitive Edge but it's the consistency of our advertising that reassures consumers that the image of the brand and the flavor promise of the franchise remain unchanged regardless of the packages we introduced, we continue to be single-minded our advertising constantly reinforcing the flavor Heritage of the brand and providing substantial support for both our full flavor and our lights packets in 1985 we ran several multiple page units for specials intended to break through the advertising clutter allowing smokers to spend a little more time in multiple countries however in today's competitive environment by in fact advertising alone, I cannot sustain over strong growth, retail promotions plan increasingly important role that tracking new smokers to Marlboro both combating the discount strategy of our bulbar continued its value added approach by offering consumers a variety of incentives free with by the to Packer carton purchase, our red with lighter continues to remain one of our most popular items, we believe that carton incentives like the ball vertex and poker card set and the mole bird or poster which combined value and image for the best way to reward a franchise promote trial build our business long term this year Marlboro will be taking aggressive steps to ensure our competitive position at retail next month bulbar will be offering to Consumers to take the set the best of Marlboro country music free with carton purchase and, retail outlets March and April the sales force will be conducting special coverage of a null VAR o the primary goal including retail visibility availability also in April Marlboro will offer a corduroy Sports cap free Department purchase is part of the bulbar supports gear promotion the combined impact of all this activity to give over a very competitive position early in the year, like retail promotions events promotions have grown an important small world events promotions reach out of our traditional retail environment and allow us the opportunity to distribute free samples and brand merchandise we also sponsor events that are unique and Innovative I'd like to give you a sense of how dramatically we have expanding breath quality of our promotions, the mole per cup was our first promotional event 1973 today is one of the most respected for thoroughbred horse races in America in 76 we added our Resort coverage with sampling and giveaways and few spring vacation spots it is evolved now into a year-round program conducted in over 50 markets in 1981 we participated in our first aesthetic Festival, today we conduct festivals of 15 major markets accounted for nearly 70 percent of the towing special population, 1983 the Mulberry ski challenge was operating on a test basis and Colorado Boulder today this program is available in 15 of the most prestigious ski resorts in the country, and since 1984 Mulberry country music has come to be recognized as the finest concert tour of the music industry tracking such stars as Barbara Mandrell Alabama Merle Haggard, in the early 80s we began to actively support Grand Prix auto racing events here in the US last year we significantly increased our involvement and auto racing with an extensive track Science Program along with sampling and Merchandising activities and cart Indy car racing events in addition we signed for the top drivers on the circuit board to the Mad World Championship team based on our program success last year mobile Spa, answer the Marlborough Patrick racing team featuring driver Emerson fittipaldi this year this sponsorship will make mulgarath dominant Factor US Auto Racing, well over has been and continues to be a singular marketing success significant challenges remain usually we must continue to provide consumers complete line of Park alternatives to aggressive carefully thought-out line extensions, the same time we must preserve the created image that has been so effective over the years while ensuring that the mole per brand Remains the temporary and finally his mole burrowed becomes one of every four cigarettes sold in the US must make a adequate inventory visibility and Retail to ensure that the branch that's what growth is not restricted in any way, they all turn the presentation over to Ellen Merlot group director of brand management thank you Bob and good afternoon Virginia Slims has been a consistent winner in 1985 is no exception twins was only one of three brands in the entire industry to show significant growth volume increased by almost a billion units to sixteen point seven billion and shared group to tens of a SharePoint to an all-time high of 2.8, well Full Flavor Flav's declined by 400 Days in million people like games 260 million units but as you can see weisbrot wasn't sufficient to offset the decline of the paratactic therefore the highly successful introduction of Virginia Slims 120s in October which contributed 1.2 billion units to the franchise provided the impetus to give the brand its net gain of six, 1%, Virginia Slims 120 is will launch nationally with one of the most comprehensive advertising and Retail programs ever designed to encourage trial and conversion highlights of the introductory program included 241 offers is sensitive items a special five pack offer especially designed for carton out less free pack offer and a special playing card offer, year-end Virginia Slims 124 contributing a nest of four defensive a SharePoint to the franchise, in 1985 we supported the brand with compelling and temporary advertising in 1986 and advertise it continues with graphic emphasis on the modern Virginia slim woman our ethnic Market advertising will utilize dramatic photograph and Graphics devices to emphasize our mental passing this approach will also be translated to point-of-sale Outdoor Advertising will be more impactful, in both General and ethnic markets during 1985 we once again filled at the annual Virginia Slims book of days partner says one of the most successful promotions in the industry in 1986 or promotional activity will be even more aggressive as this year's partner incentive will be the Virginia Slims slim stack while the 1987 book of days will be utilized as a 3-pack incentive, both items will be already competitive trial and conversion in addition will inaugurate the Virginia Slims slim shop for page ad which will feature specially designed clothing and Leisure Time gear on a self-liquidating bases in the area of the event promotion the Virginia Slims world championship series Remains the Brand's Premier promotion 1985 reduced record crowds at all of it, enhance our tenant sponsorship in 1986 we will be offering or retail consumers a to tax incentives you've come a long way baby shoelaces a genius with American woman's opinion poll a national survey conducted by the broker organization which investigated both women's and men's attitudes in the areas of family marriage career and child-rearing generated impressive National publicity, in 1985 the gymnosperms tested is fashion Fun Fair shopping mall promotion and three City in 86 this promotion will be expanded into tenses the show which brings the Virginia Slims imagery alive to 2 over 2 million Shoppers provides us the opportunity to sample between a half and three quarters of a million female smokers in 1986 we will continue to do product development, current projects include advertising and packaging Explorations for an ultra-light also under consideration or brown or beige wrap cigarettes as well as the lights products utilizing Innovative packages finally in 1985 Virginia slim successfully tested the Virginia Slims money coupon in 1986 we will utilize the point-of-sale execution nationally Virginia Slims money books a $2.00 Department of our new, 20 will be featured more Virginia Slims has been successful in part because of the storm immigrant groups created for the product and the many opportunities we create the smokers to relate to that unique imagery our future plans call for continuing the momentum to keep the Slim's growth Trend heading upwards, Buster notable incident edges in 1985 best hunters had just sold twenty seven point three billion units decline from 1.6 billion years it's what gross overall share of 4.6 was down two types of a SharePoint from 1984, looking at volume and detail DNH full flavor Decline 7.6% and the lights packings were off as well down 6.1% the Benson & Hedges Deluxe Ultra Lights group for 10% Benson and hedges has been a Troublesome brand declining the past three years our objectives for Benson and hedges are clear in the short term we want to stabilize the sales and share and longer term return the brand new growth, we've approached the task of improving the Brand's performance on three levels advertising and tactical consumer promotion which was TJ Klein extensions first we recognize that our old advertising to Deluxe 100 black broad-based appeal therefore we developed a new campaign to Features differences of opinion which focuses on the one thing everyone can agree on the taste of Benson & Hedges America's favorite 100, this campaign broadens the appeal in contains much of the humor and warmth reminiscent of the original Benson & Hedges advertisement, Fester catches has also been negatively affected by declining trial competitive pressure from value G therefore we have taken a number of technical steps that are consumer promotions to attract new smokers and retain current consumers we recently Mass sampled over 6 million smokers with sample 20 packs each containing a coupon good for three dollars off the purchase of a car Confessor Hedges believed that sampling and cart trial particular converting this smokers to the, to make our advertising work harder we're developing a number of themes promotions designed to generate greater consumer involvement and trial this Valentine said also includes a Cartier Diamond sweepstakes to dollar coupon offer free incentives with carton purchase like the best Innovations cookbook recipes from America's great for Resorts reward current smokers and attract new ones, let's enter Hedges primarily on the strength of his mental packings continue to be a significant brand among black smokers the brand accounts for nearly nine percent of these smokers and is important to compliment our advertising with more aggressive promotional activity last summer we implemented a major retail program and ethnic markets featuring in-store promotions signage broad based sampling and Festival activities, furthermore we're putting the finishing touches on a black music concert series which will feature prominent black acts like The Pointer Sisters Patti LaBelle, being H is also a leader among the growing spedex segment with the seven share we continue to increase both media promotional support for just important smoker group however our most important strategic challenge will be a capture a greater share of the growing hundred mm lotar segment last year we spent considerable time evaluating the Dynamics of the franchise, analyzing the prayer and share category by packing you can see the mean Age full flavor enjoys a 16 percent share of segments and the deluxe Ultra Lights packings have a 19 share of this category the likes packings are significantly under developed with only an H here therefore we are concentrating our efforts to revitalizing the liquid portion of the franchise to the Head we began chest marketing a Benson & Hedges Deluxe lights line extension this, past October line extension uses upscale packaging visit the Lux ultralight to provide news value for the brand test results to date indicates the brand as a 7/10 smokers here we are currently refined the advertising optimize the product positioning expect to be National later this year we haven't Benson & Hedges of powerful brand franchise the top quality product upscale image High consumer of recognition, Mission the challenge in 1986 will be to leverage these attributes and return to branch of growth successful implementation of our brand plans, yeah I'd like to spend a minute talking about Parliament and Saratoga these two Brands don't get a great deal of attention the nevertheless accounted for over seven and a half billion units and sales in contributed 108 million dollars in margin in Parliament despite an absence of advertising and promotion support for most of the Year generated 5.8 billion units and sales decline of 300 million gets share remain basically flat one percent, in our efforts to reverse this decline we developed a new Campaign which features the primary product benefit the recessed filter but also establishes an image of a smoker profile the campaign began running and September and receive concentrated media support Parliament top 15 markets which for counter over two-thirds Parliament sales in 1986 the brand will be further supported by an aggressive Regional retail merchandising program, Saratoga sales of 1.8 billion units in 1985 represents a decline of nearly 200 million units will share remaining basically stable at 3/10 of a share we do this performances encouraging our total was without a verdict without an advertising campaign we have just completed new created for the brand which we believe can broaden the appeal the track smokers of competing hundred millimeter 120 mm load bar brands, in addition we're currently redesigning the star total packaging to give it a more contemporary look once this is complete we will be in a position to resist supporting the plan Mary came to the market is a revolutionary product the result of a breakthrough in cigarette design manufacturing and marketing the brand established a strong franchise but lately has been in a period of decline as the low tar category hit a plateau, well total Merit volume declined by the 1.3 billion units to twenty four point two billion in total share declined to tens of a SharePoint 24.1 in 85 there was evidence that last year's launch of Merit Kings box help to stabilize the overall losses of the parent Axiom specifically the parents are packed with 1.9 million units while box contributed 1.6 billion unit, Marigold to life in the face of a declining ultra low category continue to grow the overall decline in marriage cell can largely be attributed to two factors the decline of the full price float our category and the growth of generics and value entries we don't need however that in the short term we will be able to stabilize them but putting in place long-term strategy to bring about share revitalization, action we have already developed programs to encourage trial to stimulate sales and carton outlets and to create imagery that offers a smoker benefit and provides a strong promotional platform let's first look at advertising in 1983 we launched the Steve campaign subsequent research told us the imagery generated by that advertising did not appeal to our target audience the ultralights execution of the campaign however, ferrets would be much more On Target as a result while keeping the sea is the venue we created new advertising that is motivational aspirational and provides the imagery needed to support strong promotional content utilizing and craft grass Graphics that feature men and women enjoying their sailing experience we invite the consumer to get a taste to this mirror the lotor flavor break the campaign, test extremely well among both Merit and competitive smokers the new campaign will support both parents and ultralights this new advertising will be launched in February with a dramatic three phas, in mid 85 Merit introduced a number of tactical programs to generate new smoker trial and be more responsive to competitive couponing and the valuing tree in November Mara transporter full sweep stakes in which every entrance received a free pack of Merit upon depositing a sweepstakes entry at his favorite retail outlet initial results show that this was an effective trial interesting vehicle in more will invite consumers to, it tasted it for $2 off on the next part purchase the coupon will appear in National magazines and will be retail with jeans we expect it will generate significant product movement in court now Outlet where Merit has been particularly vulnerable in the area of consumer promotion the city provided us with the backdrop in 1985 to run our successful sunglasses free with a 2-pack purchase and Uncle bags with the court, we also offered the merits Zippo lighter to Magazine on a self-liquidating basis this March Merit will offer a handsome sailcloth Wallet free with a free pack purchase we will follow up in June with a carton offer attractive see coasters and in the fourth quarter of 1986 we will feature the self-liquidating liquor ads in 1985 Merit or cologne are fireworks spectacular, find the brand of quality sampling opportunity in Seven Cities and accounted for the distribution of over a quarter of a million samples it is also produced impressive national and local publicity results in 1986 this program will be extended to include 96 while improved advertising and tactical programs to stabilize the Brand's existence position they alone not be expected to provide a meaningful turnaround in marriage, Share Credit to accomplish our goals we're looking at a number of strategies in the area of product development first we're waiting Merit hundreds box below launch this entry takes advantage of the growth in both 100 and box segments and can be expected to attract a female smokers with first-year volume potential of at least two billion units, the strategically positioning of mirrored ultralights another possibility the new brand volume, for the product concept of all the taste of leading lotar brands with only one-half to one-third guitar we believe more smokers would move to marry a Tall Tree wise for you to lay slicing updated yet traditional Merit advertising there is a solid Market opportunity for a new marital life at four milligrams of tar, high technology May well provide strong parentage for our latest orangie break through the adjustable flavor cigarettes because line extensions have recently proven more successful standing entry Merit selection is being considered as a conquered test Market alternatives, looking further ahead merits technological history is also a natural fit for a low size screen for ambient smoke cigarettes married a less or low smoke will confront the environmental or secondhand smoke concerns head-on by creating news for the franchise with a strategic new product entry and Fielding solid advertising and business building programs we are confident we can meet our goal of first stabilizing, and then once again growing this vital franchise and now to review our sales progress thank you Salado Vice President of Sales thank you Ellen thank the ongoing charge for the sales organization is to attain a retail presence which reflects our market share leadership today I want to review our progress towards that goal and discuss this year's objectives and how we intend to achieve them, we made a commitment to years ago to make Philip Morris USA America's dominant cigarette marketer at retail at the same time we recognize the need to improve our Shelf presence and depth of inventory our objective was to improve the long-standing seven percent efficiency between our share of market and our share of inventory correcting this deficiency with the basis of our 1985 strategy and that strategy at five major elements, first competitive and pre-emptive Merchandising payment programs to significantly increase carton pack space s aggressive programs to make Philip Morris USA the preeminent fixture supplier of position held by RJ are rentals for more than 30 years before continuing in store exposure of Creator promotions and point-of-sale materials that build consumer interest, for intrusive signage and displays the promote brand awareness and support new brand introductions and finally an intensive sales effort aimed at high volume accounts promoting the profitability of cigarettes and establishing Philip Morris as the ultimate cigarette merchandising Authority one of the primary tools for the implementation of these strategies is plan a are carton merchandising incentive program it's in place and 80%, my volume Outlets those selling 300 or more cartons of cigarettes a week improve our presence and the remaining 20% and to increase our share of space and existing plan a accounts on October 1st we aggressively restructured the plan a program we can now provide retailers with a clear incentive to stock enough p.m. product to meet consumer demand RJR can no longer control our destiny on their fixtures and are preemptive, payment structure has caused our smaller competitors to re-examine their needs bring space for p and g is the new plan a working we think so in the four months since October we signed 160,000 new grows three times our accomplishments for the previous 15 months the new plan has created eight hundred thousand additional cartons of display retail inventory thus since December of 1983 we have increased our shell, if Presence by over 20% however our historical disadvantage coupled with our growth objectives require that we continue to carve out additional shelf space at the current Progressive rate, the sales organization has also made significant strides in establishing p.m. as a realistic alternative to RJ r as the industry's fixture supplier we have developed a new generation of customized modular Carton and pack racks winning awards for merchandising excellent, the Salesforce has been securing carton fixture placements by concentrating on high volume chains by the end of 1985 our sales representatives in stole over 1,600 carton racks in these larger Outlets are successful re emphasis on carton merchandising during 1985 has 4 star J are in full costly response under its new plan RJ r-- s in store investment could increase more than 20 million dollars just, to maintain existing fixture planets payments replacement, increasing retail price of cigarettes has also generated new interest in single pack merchandising rapid growth and such traditional pack Outlets as convenience stores along with renewed emphasis on pack sales and supermarkets have created new opportunities for p.m. through arcade counter display program Plan B Philip Morris has gained the presence in 84,000 retail pack Outlets more than any other competitor, a new horizontal display unit we were able to secure Groove physician and high-volume chain outlets and continue the intended upgrade the larger displays, we have also gained new placements and overhead pack merchandisers which are effective for counter space is at a premium we placed over 21,000 of these racks by the end of 1985 and in so doing significantly improve the in-store impact of brand POS, long-standing RJR dominance of supermarket checkout lane racks has limited p.m. brand availability and inventory death new pack Hardware permitted us to offer centralized track merchandising in my volume Self Service Outlets 1985 over 4,000 racks were placed increasing both depth of inventory and product visibility through the paid display space atop each of the wrecks, our new merchandising programs and fixturing placements have had a noticeable impact on the availability of our brands of retail most notable is the significant Improvement in Volvo inventory levels in food stores where we have achieved a 22 percent increase over the last 12 months however our objective is to reach Winston's 14-day duration point-of-sale materials provide an essential visual bridge between product advertising and the consumer, year-end 1985 almost 750 thousand pieces of permanent materials for in place in over two-thirds of all Outlets selling cigarettes in addition we placed over 6 million temporary pieces we estimate that this concentration of point-of-sale averages 4.4 product and precious to the store, to sum up our achievements in 1985 we improved our in-store position with the series of innovative and persuasive merchandising programs and materials we made our merchandising incentive plans more attractive especially for high-volume our talents who became a major supplier and innovator of carbon fixtures, we strengthened our already substantial position in fact merchandising we increase our concentration and distribution of point-of-sale materials and we continue to carry the cigarette profitability message to retailers today we're in the third year of our plan to make Philip Morris USA the number one cigarette company at retail during 1986 we will provide even more reasons for retailers to sell cigarettes and better still Philip Morris, and continue our progress we have developed some new merchandising programs for implementation this year, support our entries into the price value Arena we will establish cigarette saving centers in high-volume carton Outlets, a newly designed Maxi overhead pack merchandiser is great with space for 25% more brand packets, a new generation of counter pack merchandiser will be placed to improve visibility and increase inventory depth by 50% and we will continue customizing POS materials for large retail chains to increase Philip Morris visibility will continue building and improving the productivity of our sales organization by adding 200 people how the sales force to make nearly 1 million additional calls a year and support our growing Hardware from it, it redeploying are expanded Workforce and targeting large-volume accounts with greater call frequency and more competitive programs, developing a national network of POS distribution centers to facilitate the flow of materials for sales organization, maximizing the use of many and Maxie bands 32 sales rep downtime at local Supply Depots and expanding the use of portable computers to help managers simplify reporting and Taylor profit presentations from customers let me conclude by restating that Philip Morris USA has made a long-term commitment assuming retail leadership in the cigarette business and that the realization of this commitment is essential to our continued growth, and we're on schedule to reach our goals and I look forward to reporting more progress soon they'll thank you video I mentioned at the outset that size and momentum can only go so far in achieving sales Sharon from the progress in the cigarette business that was true in 1985 another year of major changes in the industry a multiple Price Market became firmly established, 25 became a bona fide product category with both convenience and value option consumers readily accepted 120 mm line extension we tested or may firm plans to test new cigarette technology new packaging materials and Concepts, the nation's chain supermarkets convenience stores and mass merchandisers increased in importance as Battlegrounds for the cigarette power with RJ are being truly challenged for the first time when we went into 98 by much of this new cigarette business was unknown while we came out of 1985 stronger more flexible and more resilient than ever we need to be even better prepared for 1986, we wouldn't wait five and four of the strongest brand fresh as in the business are continuing priority is to keep these Brands healthy with Superior product quality advertising retail and consumer promotions if our past performance is any indication these Brands will be the Mainstay of most of p.m. USA sales and much of our growth in the coming years, however we also know that to ensure the long-term growth objectives we must pursue a new brand opportunity although new brands remain extremely difficult we must remember that new products OB it as line extensions delivered 7.5 billion units in 1985 our philosophy is to experiment with a wide range of product options in a real Market environment, New Brains activity is intense and aggressive concentrating in four areas specifically the value and medical segments in the upscale luxury changing area and the high-tech product differentiation Zarina, as the low price segment became more important we made an entry in this category or number one priority the price of added value category is segmented into two groups the value-added include Point users on one hand and the low price generic Darrell slopers on the other to appeal to the former group we successfully tested players like 25 and launched it nationally last month the pack selling concept is 25, let's for the price of 20 or five free cigarettes every pack the advertising is both contemporary and stylish and should attract both Richland and Century smokers are carton of selling proposition is a standard 200 cigarette carton but at a dollar 50 less than most other brands in addition we'll be offering $1 carton coupons, to reduce the retail price of a Courtney $2.50 making it competitive with generics and very appealing to coupon however we realize that to attract a hardcore generic smokers we must first offer them everyday low price of a generic then to differentiate our product we must deliver a good-tasting cigarette not currently available to them to meet this objective we have, reposition Cambridge in 1986 as an established brand name and the lowest price tear the advertising will clearly convey the good taste low price message as well as stand out from the other low price injuries Cambridge is in the initial stages of its National rolling, after the value segments are most obvious area of opportunity is the mental category menthols represent represent Twenty Eight percent of the market and Philip Morris is shear is less than 17% well we have not been successful in developing a free-standing product to the segment we did learn a great deal from last year's real test Morgan real red pack and Escapist imagery were not enough confirming that new, for Brands like others need to deliver a true unique and unique consumer benefit from this experience we plan to test mental France with real product differences this year the first gold Motorway is a foil-wrapped product which retains moisture and therefore delivers a fresher tasting cigarette mutter a gives us both a little wrapper and a research confirmed better, f it extra freshness which we call moist medical the third area of exploration is Deluxe packaging the success of definite edges to look so much alike and the high degree of Interest generated by players like that indicated that there might be room for other upskill for an introduction so we contracted with rock bands for the tub domain we then went into test with an American Blended enter the test began, an engine and is continuing to run with very restricted seals results the appeal for a u.s. luxury product in the current Marketplace a limited We are continuing to evaluate the test and are considering a more targeted approach using an international Virginia blend product and package for a real product difference this positioning may have a stronger long-term segment appeal, I'm working just from watching closely this Concord with this revolutionary adjustable filter well consumer trial level indicated significant interest in this concept repeat sales have been less than satisfactory however because of the uniqueness of the product in an industry with few real Innovations we plan to review the test results and relaunch a new test markets in 1986 with much stronger benefit oriented advertising, because Menthol smokers have shown a stronger interest in the concept and non-medical smokers we will concentrate only on the Menthol packing realizing that cigarette Innovation that stimulate incremental volume is sheer we are also pursuing other real Innovations such as low side stream nicotine free and self-extinguishing cigarette, the accomplishments and problems of 1985 set the stage for the objectives and opportunities of 1986 our agenda is a straight forward and come back at work we will continue to push moreover with Virginia Slims to new heights we accept the challenge of fixing their investment hitches through a combination of do brand tactics strategies aligning station plan to be a major factor, the price value statement with Cambridge players and others if required our president has described in 1986 is the year at retail while recognizing our tremendous accomplishments and interests last year we've remained challenge to become the number one cigarette company or read it after we pre-emptive little for competitors we intend to unseat or Jo are from the retail Supremacy they failed, first of all although the new products new technology game for cigarettes is difficult and sometimes discouraging we are resilient and determine both the mental and my technology area we have set a course for continued progress in the new cigarette industry with your health and support along with that emotion and operations are the engineering core, a human resources and Finnegan I'm certain it will have no trouble going create new field in fact living through the adversity of today's computer failure as an improvement to very important things one that we are very determined and resilient working group and to that you were very supportive board of directors thank you very much for taking questions very good, it's even better, we can make it right about between between a quarter and a third of basically Vinnie and the every revision of the place, I have to accommodate more spin we're doing everything that we possibly can to what those things and it does have a benefit to imagine you noticed to respond to our last fixture program Reynolds head to defend their position is to defend their position plus the 40 million dollars, the advantage of the audience's death 40 million dollars comes out of their coupon budget and that's exactly what we want them to have to do we want to try, which brand therefore which advertising is directed toward the blue-collar smoker, Mauro is very Universal but Marlboro gets virtually the entire working class population other than other than the black population Benson & Hedges is are predominantly black Grant but Marlboro really covers every other side of it is true most of our friends are upscale but that is helped us through this generic thrust because most of, that demographics is through college so the case it is fair to say that really is a philosophy in the policy but that case you only could basically machine you to go after blue-collar by going after Duke up you go we do everything elegant with an elegant purveyors of mass merchandisers and that's the way we think you attract everyone don't attract bukata people by portraying Blue Collar people per se, so we don't really go after blue color but I'm making it do if I have intruded well if you were forced into something as a result of not having the opportunity to television and I think it has made me much more aware of the marketplace being people personally I think the approach to your marketing given your budget and Faith television opened, yup would you Retreat away from this creative Innovative personal approach to 40 half minutes what our marketing mix of evolved the way it has I think you're very lucky, or marketing mix towards things like event promotions consumer promotions those things in any case for instance in the in the beer business where they still have television they're more in mixes have evolved in that way so I think others would too I think that there's a an extension of your image that you can do through a vet promotion I even put the product in people's hands that that the mass media just can't do and I think that everybody's discovering that and, and as you say we discovered it by force of the of the television band but now that we have it I don't think we would give up mr. chairman will turn it back to you and we'll answer cases of lunch or what okay thank you very much Frank and Bill thanks a lot of very good presentation anybody wants to take a lunch break I wanted was to come back and see the real truck",0.8248736278504676,0.46485132,0.91283864
gywv0183,"the following video tape is the second in a series of employee Communications programs we will hear from Jeff Bible Marie bring general counsel and Executive Vice President for external Affairs Steve Parrish senior vice president corporate Affairs and a group of employees representing all of our companies who participated in a question and answer session about important issues facing Philip Morris and the tobacco industry and now here's Jeff Bible, I'm glad you're taking the time to join me today but I wish I could be having this conversation in person with every one of our more than 150,000 employees in 180 countries around the world over the next several months I expect a visit with as many of you as possible to discuss some of the issues of importance to you and our company, I'm taking the opportunity to speak with you now because over the last few months the US tobacco industry and our company have been the focus of an unprecedented series of attacks some radical steps have been taken by a US government agency and endorsed by President Clinton that had the potential to lead to Serious harm to our entire industry if left unchallenged, Food and Drug Administration commissioner David Kessler some members of the US Congress and many anti smoker activists have used a variety of tactics to support their efforts to attempt to regulate the ability of adult Americans to choose to smoke and the ability of our company to Market and sell our cigarette products in a free and competitive Marketplace, we shall not let their efforts go unchallenged, in pursuit of their goal they have manipulated and distort facts to accuse Philip Morris of a broad array of improper conduct and to intact the Integrity of our company and its outstanding employees and we shall not let these accusations and attacks stand on challenged not with the American public and not with the people of all of the markets where we conduct business and most of all not with our employees, so first let's set the record straight on the issue of Youth smoking Philip Morris believes children should not smoke and should not have access to cigarettes smoking and purchasing cigarettes a decisions for adults to make Philip Morris is committed to that philosophy around the world and we've taken actions to back up our commitment he fact we recently proposed an aggressive program in the u.s. directed at preventing youth access to cigarettes, we stand ready to work with anyone who truly wants to address this issue and we are working within the cultures and laws of the other countries where we do business to take appropriate actions to keep cigarettes away from kids, but do not be misled by what has been proposed by the president and the FDA rather than choosing to join us to make our program work and to explore other areas where we could work together to address this issue David Kessler an unelected Federal bureaucrat has decided to seek control over our industry and control over choices adults should be allowed to make in a free Society, you've heard me say it before if you're right and you fight you will win as you know we have a very recent example to back up that philosophy ABC accused us of spiking us cigarettes with extra nicotine we told them they were wrong and they settled anyway so we sued them and ABC apologized now let's look at the result PC this is World News Tonight the ten billion, lawsuit filed against ABC News by Philip Morrison r.j. Reynolds was settled this evening with a statement ABC News agrees that we should not have reported that Philip Morris and Reynolds add significant amounts of nicotine from outside sources that was a mistake that was not delivered on the part of ABC but for which we accept responsibility and which requires correction we apologize to our audience Philip Morris and Reynolds Just does with ABC's admitted mistake we can't let stand David Kessler's grab for power, over the u.s. tobacco industry and 45 million adult Americans smokers that is why as a first step we've joined with other us tobacco manufacturers in a suit to prevent Kessler from accomplishing what he set out to do let me say unequivocally our lawsuit has absolutely nothing to do with you sneaking it has everything to do with an unbridled and illegal government action it has everything to do with stopping not only the DraStic and illegal actions now, on the table but the inevitable result of giving an unelected bureaucrat the power to do more this is going to be a long and tough fight but keep in mind we are right this is a country that still believes in Freedom and that is what this B about while I'm confident that we shall Prevail in the end what concerns me as much or more is the highly orchestrated stream of statements speeches and news reports you've, been hearing that falsely accused Philip Morris of a broad array of improper conduct, what the people who make the accusation to done and continue to do is to manipulate and misrepresent the facts to their own ends these tactics are despicable I know these reports concern you as well I know you're hearing from friends and neighbors and family who've been hearing the same reports we want you to have the facts we're proud of our company and you have every reason to be proud as well, Mary bring our distinguished general counsel and Executive Vice President for external Affairs and equally distinguished Steve Parrish who is senior vice president corporate Affairs are going to provide you more information to put these tactics into their proper perspective let's join them as they discuss this with the group of Philip Morris employees from all segments of our company and remember we are right and we will fight and we intend to win for you and for our company, now we have with us today employees from Philip Morris USA Kraft Foods Miller Brewing Company Philip Morris Capital Corporation Philip Morris International Kraft Foods International and Philip Morris Management corporation, I want to thank all of you for coming here to participate in this meeting today and Steve and I will do our best to answer any questions you might have about these and other issues of concern so let me ask now who has the first question my name is Marion Walgren I work with Philip Morris Management Corp in corporate contributions I had a question about the ABC case after reading the apology that appeared in the Wall Street Journal it appears that the apology was very carefully worded, and I had a question as to whether or not Philip Morris companies was satisfied with the apology we're in let me try that one the answer is absolutely yes we are very satisfied with the apology it is a total and complete Victory as far as we are concerned what you have seen in the last few days is a bit of revisionist History where ABC themselves are characterizing the program as not really focusing on spiking, is focusing on something else manipulation in the Recon process a number of the members of the press of picked up on that theme the plaintiffs lawyers and mr. Waxman and others have also picked up on that theme and said well this was really not a significant apology because it didn't it didn't go to the heart of the program as I say that is revisionist history if one looks at the program that they one program and of the public reaction after it starting with President Clinton and going all the, all the way through the Waxman and Senator Kennedy and surgeongeneral Coop they were all focused on the outrageous charge that we were adding more nicotine to cigarettes in order to keep people smoking the spiking allegation was the central core of that program that's why we brought the lawsuit and that's why we decided to settle it when ABC said we were wrong and we apologize so we think that that apology was quite significant and we think that we got exactly what we, wanted to get when we brought the lawsuit was to vindicate ourselves in the Public's eye and make everyone realize that the outrageous allegation that we were spiking cigarettes was absolutely untrue that it was a lie and they have now apologized for that and I think we should all feel very good about that I can tell you I certainly do my name is Glory makoni I work at Philip Morris International and Rye Brook and my concern is now that the media has backed down, from accusing us of spiking cigarettes we still have the issue of manipulation to deal with doesn't that leave us vulnerable to get back into the spiking issue and how do we protect ourselves from that and how do we put that completely to rest well I think that's a very good question because there's no question there's no doubt that you still read a lot about the so-called manipulation and I think it's important to realize that just, just as we do not Spike nor do we manipulate we simply don't do it I think we put the spiking issue to rest once and for all and hopefully we'll be able in the near future to put the manipulation issue to rest as well the fact of the matter is that every cigarette that we manufacture has to comply with the published tar and nicotine nicotine delivery numbers that are required by the Federal Trade Commission, so we manufacture our cigarettes and through a process of blending and filtration we ensure that we are delivering to the smoker exactly the level of tar and nicotine that we indicate we're going to deliver now that's not manipulation that simply quality control manipulation is a word that has a sort of pejorative connotation in suggest that we're doing something wrong and that's the reason that the anti-smoking activists use the word but there is, not a single thing in any of our documents or in any of the evidence that has been disclosed by dr. Kessler or mr. Waxman which indicates that we are manipulating nicotine in order to keep people smoking which is the allegation that many of them make the fact of the matter is if you look back over the history of our products during the past several years there has been a continual decline in the amount of nicotine that is delivered to smokers and as a matter of fact if you look at the, focus of the reconstituted process which was the subject of some of the ABC program and other critics the reconstituted process takes nicotine out of the tobacco leaf and every step of the process and at the end of that process there's less nicotine in the sheet that is used for use in manufacturing circuit cigarettes than there was in the original plant before it went into that process, s so the simply isn't any truth to it and I think that in due course when we have the opportunity in courtrooms or in other forums like the Food and Drug Administration to get our side of the story across it will become clear that there simply isn't anything to the manipulation charge just as there was not to the spike in charge my name is Paul Farkas I work at the Stockton Street facility in Richmond I'm a chief shops do it for the International Association of machinists and Aerospace workers, the reason story in the Richmond newspapers concerning the study conducted in Chesterfield County with the third grade students has caused a morale problem in the factory due to the fact of the adverse public opinion that towards full of Mars employees you care to comment further on that issue sure let me just try to put that proposed study into perspective first remember that it was never proposed that we were going to give cigarettes to kids, it was never proposed that we were going to do research on nicotine and children what we were doing or what we were talking about doing was something that people who are funded by the federal government we're doing namely looking at personality profiles of people who were smokers and comparing them to personality profiles of people who turned out not to be smokers The Proposal which was not carried out was to try to identify whether these specific children turned out to be smokers when they were adults so too, her eyes this as nicotine research on kids or research on smoking and kids is absolutely untrue and outrageous I'm Rose Wang from Kraft Foods International regarding the electroshock study what is the relevance of that subject to waxman's agenda or Kessler's agenda number one and the second question is how is that study any more or less extraordinary than any you know other study that's being done in Laboratories and, cities worldwide lets you make two very good points that study was done in complete accordance with scientific protocols that others outside of Philip Morris had been doing before we did this study it's also important to remember that this very mild electric shock that we were talking about was administered to the fingers I think some people tried to give the impression that it was something much more Insidious than that it was done according to a strict scientific protocol, that had been done by independent scientists outside of Philip Morris and that was all reported in the scientific literature it was part of a discussion that was going on both inside our industry and outside the industry which is why do people smoke what effects if any does smoking have on stress and other things and scientists inside the industry and outside the industry were interested in those things and so they used scientifically accepted protocols to, try to address the issue you know Steve I'd like to just add one thing to his kind of anecdotal but as to that issue but I think it's kind of interesting mr. Waxman made it sound as though this was some sort of aberrational way out experiment that Philip Morris was conducting that everyone should be shocked about I remember when I was in college the psychology department was always posting ads on the bulletin board saying for $5 any student can volunteer to be a participant in this, are meant and they the experiments went on for pages I mean how long could you stand on one foot for example I remember was one of them and students were flocking to volunteer for these programmes of the way of that have making a few extra bucks so this is commonplace at universities psychology departments are always recruiting students to participate in these experiments and it's something that goes on and I think has gone on for a long long time and for mr. Waxman to suggest that somehow this was unique",0.8393571057142856,0.6780095,0.9128389
gzgb0039,"I think they're on the right track I just think they need to work on just a little bit more like they're about halfway through yeah okay they've covered every every aspect as far as a secondhand person goes but the flavor is the main issue for a smoker's a lot of smokers you if they get stressed out they smoke a cigarette and probably these aren't going to give him the same satisfaction because a, feminine as a regular cigarette he hung the positive feedback that you get you said it was it from your son who's 17 you don't get that with your regular cigarettes so I'm going to play a little game has gone exactly they go they go like that and I'm sure at some point maybe wears on you or maybe it goes in one ear and out the other now I don't know but going to how much you keep silent about it okay but in this case he's not doing that kind of liked it, and you have an option of smoking this product in your house and he doesn't give you grief or saying forget it I'm going to I'm not I can't deal with the taste of this product I'm going to stay with this and deal with the grief you very you've decided I'll smoke this and deal with the grief instead okay that's fair that's fair enough it's just not their 30-year the balance of the trade-offs hasn't hasn't gotten to that point for you okay with this be a dismal failure if they were to introduce this product now I think so I think so okay, so we would be really bad okay I think right at the point they're at right now it's an excellent Aid in stopping, why no nicotine and you have something in your hand and if you want to stop smoking bad enough you'll put up with a flavor mmm you know and I felt that I came pretty close to not needing the nicotine okay okay with that maybe with with the aid of I don't know nicotine gum or a nicotine patch somebody could quit smoking pretty quick because that's one of the way I've tried patches and the main thing in, trying to stop was I had to have something in my hand the nicotine was there I just had to have something in my hand, question that I'm going to wrap it up and with give you an opportunity to ask me some questions if you want a lot has been in the Press recently about secondhand smoke right actually for the last year or two there so you're aware of what they're saying about secondhand smoke right okay that it's a what an annoyance or a hazard for both both both do you believe that, yeah you can call your toolbar and Noise Okay as far as a hazard goes I don't believe anything the government says okay and from what I've seen this is a government survey it's totally been done by the government mmm and I don't I don't believe it okay okay I don't believe the surveys okay one types of cancers that people are getting from cigarettes because I honestly believed if they looked a little closer they might find it there's a lot of cancers out, out there that people get rid of this smoke or not you know and I don't think that secondhand smoke is going to affect someone bad enough for Endless there unless they don't mind it enough to sit in a room with 20 people smoking cigarette every kind of life okay well now the hand you know you can walk into a room where there's you just walk in and I've been there smoking automatically your eyes started burning your nostril started burning and my throat so, you know it very well could if you were around it every day you could have tried to tell you he they're not in you're not inhaling a freshly lit cigarette in inhaling all the smoke from that and then exhaling I was there getting his he exhaled by product for her most of the Tarzan it I've already gone down into your lungs you know and there's a lot of it's had a lot of it has and it comes back out and they contain gets on the windows and things like that but do you enjoy smoking, and if somebody asked you to do you enjoy smoking hella how would you answer that question yeah yeah enjoy Tim I think that's why I have such a hard time quitting because I do I do enjoy save you really want to quit you will you will and I know that my uncle quit stuck dropping trash can and talk smoking a cigarette again I've tried the Nicorette and I'll try to quite a few different methods second on Lollipops and yeah obviously we do like it, it's okay psychological habit honest okay ask me some questions if you want is a real cigarette yeah yeah it is I you know depends on how you define a cigarette obviously but it has real tobacco and yeah I cut it open we saw that yeah they did that in the in the demonstration yeah it is it is a real cigarette it's obviously not for everybody some people really like it some people really don't like it some people like yourselves are saying well I do, like to like it but I don't know some kind of someplace in the middle but it is the cigarette and it serves a purpose for some people there's some people that are really like the idea and like the way it tastes there's other people that don't not everything is for all people so but it is it is a real cigarette if you define a cigarette is something that smokes any other questions or, how do they intend on doing more research into yeses flavor yeah yeah it's all I've got I really believed it's a beneficial product and all aspects to remember the name of it incidentally Eclipse okay I was trying to you after they brought a pack or a little boxer and ahead packs yeah I can remember I've been trying okay okay and you remember in you remember her name okay did you remember what the packaging look like and stuff would eutectic prank that are attractive you liked it, so you how about the videotape did you like that or was that take it or leave it, the video today is pretty informative but I believe they could pretty much covered and they could have done it without showing right baby okay thank at the cigarette into then they on the video they showed the inside of the cigarette yeah the diagram the inside some people almost have to have that visual aid though it's just I have to picture it in your head well somebody's talking about I'm sure they do plan on doing doing more research on it so, so maybe if you're agreeable at some point they might give you a call back and say hey we've got another another idea here are you interested in taking a shot yeah I'm interested in changing the flavor and probably if they change the flavor I would change over to okay you spoke the brown tip product and you smoke the brown pelican rifle flavor yeah okay very good because to me it seemed a smoke whites hmm it just seemed like a lot cigarette I agree when I was came in a roofing, they they had the regulars and lots of em try and one it almost seemed like the lights were heavier than the lights may be heavier than the amazing like smoke and Virginia's Lambda sounds like paper so it's funny it's different people that's how come I said no let's try the full flight work so that's what I'm going with okay you had mentioned to Helen and then we're out of here that you because you just purchase the carton of my clear you were really going to give this a shot put those aside, did you Tim start off going strictly with this product right you move back and forth I'm out of smoking one or two cigarettes a day and the other of the other ones so you went about four days or so smoking nothing but this and with that really did you do that because it was part of the researchers that the way you would have handled it in the real world if you went out and bought this product, well at this point if it was on the market I would buy it just as just to cut back on the nicotine intake that I do have I might buy a pack and a couple packs of Marlboros just try to cut back you say cut back in the nicotine do you mean the nicotine or the Tower of both in other words you're saying cut back on in the kingdom and to me that's our seems to be the most threatening okay issue the nicotine is addictive fine but from it's all right but the things that they're saying kill you, remember the talk so that is the most important thing okay do you remember what the tar was in the cigarette Point 1 mg okay point one so very low I guess and even though it's that low, and you're smoking a 16 mg product right now the trade-off is still too big for you to realize or to to accept that trade-off in switching down right well the flavors okay I mean that's that's the only issue right now okay as far as changing I like to taste of Marlboros and Winston's everything mentions will strong but I like the Marlboro a lot it's like you come close to that flavor then okay good definitely change good any other questions, we're done early but I sense that you're not going to have a problem with that so can I use the phone I guess there's lots of ladies out there and I think it's very like crazy I think that they'll probably say they'll be fine well I would definitely be interested in coming crying okay, okay I'm sure I'll still be spoken oh yeah alright very good well thank you both",0.8244614770833335,0.6701502,0.9128384

for us to have been president make this witness available will continue for a little bit longer but is that position is, is gone on longer in YouTube, our response to that is it's depositions being taken in complete compliance with the Tennessee Federal rules procedure, I haven't heard any argument to the contrary, I'm just putting you on notice, I just handed the witness exhibit 15, Park Min Joo, Malcolm sorry this is a 2015 date-stamped Mak underscore T NS ta 08512 918,you recognize this is an email to number of individuals including yourself dated July 23rd 2012 correct that is correct subject is exha go is the focus correct key assert orange listed as high correct yes they reasoned out you receive this document, okay, it's easier to just go ahead and read through the document correctly boys, T not sure I am supposed to share this with you or not but this is the message I received from Bill last week for indices do not forward I don't care one bit about call metrics between now and the launch meeting the best thing that we can do to finish strong and launch 32 strong is to live with high potential exha go targets over the next four weeks, I'm giving you interrupts the autonomy to do whatever it takes bypass low targets drive three hours to a better one whatever just drive as much exhausted or business as humanly possible before August the 12th, we talked about being the CEO of the territory or District I don't think we really buy that normally it's a very risky for the organization but over the next four weeks write it as your business I'll have your back on the call metrics frequency with the right message on people who can make a difference should carry us all three of those elements need to be there sell like your livelihood depended on it Bill live with axalta riders will, so I call Tuesday thanks cobby, I was reading that email or Fresher a glitch at all about having received this email or discussed it with eight individuals on this email, do you understand oh first of all who's you know Bill is I'm sure he's referencing into Bill Nichols Superior, he made a bill Nichols was Todd Dean Superior Corrections Todd day at this time being your district manager correct sir okay, what do you understand Bill meant when he said I'm giving you and Reps the autonomy to do whatever it takes, I don't know specifically what he means that, did you ever find out what he meant on the, on a subsequent conversation with either Todd or Bill, I don't recall any conversation okay so so as far as you know you never got any more guidance from Mallinckrodt as to what, was meant in this email to do whatever it takes, I don't recall, don't recall, the point being made here if I'm reading it correctly if you agree is that there's an impending launch of a 32 mg form of exalt go that's what builds allude to here correct that would be my understanding okay and that there's a push to sell as much as all go 60 mg as humanly possible before the release of the 32 milligrams strength objection, that's the words that are listed and is that how you understood this email objection, is the strategy that's implicated here that the more prescribers who are prescribing the 60 mg eggs all go that will make it easier to convert them to available 32 mg strength when it's launched that your understanding of the strategy here, objection lack of foundation this characterizes Park Festival, no I don't necessarily agree with that but do you understand what the push to sell much of zalga was humanly possible was driven by your action is not so super cool but makes the comment talk about being the CEO of the territory or District I don't think we really buy that normally and then here's the quote it's very risky for the organization, but you understand that to me, I understand that to me this is a statement that's been used in my entire career in this industry being the CEO of your territory that you act independently of managing your territory because you know the landscape of the territory people that are making call this or frequency reports don't know the landscape with their territory so to act as the CEO wouldn't be necessarily to abide by the call metrics but to, make sure that you are focusing on the right people during that timeframe right people meeting in this particular case for the launch of these all go 32 would be not initially spend our time with prescribers that were looking at 10:00 CET or another product but to pursue you have to be targeting our physicians that were exalted o potential okay and what's risky what's the risk posed the organization over a sales rep acting as a CEO of their Market to action I'm not, specifically sure what he means by that, do you ever find out what was meant by it being very risky for the organization, what did you understand was met by cell like your livelihood depended on it, Brett that if, these example sales are made that people might lose their jobs, action I don't believe it was, do you recall any discussion about any of the things discussed in this email with individuals on this list after the seeing all the set directions,had you a document 16 which is based and mnk underscore sta 08 93 55-47 beginning it let me know,and this is an email from Dan pull chefs key to yourself copy and Bill Nichols from April 15th 2013 correct subject is field is it for 10 through 11 correct he have any reason to doubt you receive this email in the normal course of business on about the state and this email generally describes that Dan polish FC who at the time was the district sales manager for sale, Carolina so he was your DM at this time he went with you spent your days in the field with you serving or your sales calls correct correct okay and Mel first paragraph expound comment you have some excellent relationships with your positions and their staff and it was great seeing you leverage those relationships to gain commitments to our X example go this is our X it means prescribed correct screwing, he says for example with beer and Healthcare went right after the oxy patient and ask for them to prescribe exha go since those patients could no longer get oxy we that correctly that's what it's late now it does reading that refresh her recollection about that incident at certain Health Care okay action, somewhat okay what's the truth what's it remind you of this actually had to have new decisions made for them as to the best pasta the cost of treatment so in that particular can make different case would beard and health care for a patient who are any provider for that man, for that patient before now had to make the new pathway of care for the patient and I was wanting to key positions all go as an opportunity for those patients that could no longer get what they were previously prescribed okay so this situation that that mr. Paul chefs Keys referring to it's a little different from what we talked about earlier today with respect to break through pain correct nobody okay this we're talking about, substituting exha go for an oxycontin prescription as opposed to just supplementing an oxycontin regimen with exha go for breakthrough pain correct objection you wouldn't use Oxycontin these all go together that's what I took from your question so how is this different from what we described earlier you described earlier about the Breakthrough pain, sure, in this particular case, the patients were able to give their current regimen, so there were a couple of options that patients were going to have to be chosen for Iams all there was one of those options and the conversation would have been very similar in regards to what the patient's benefits were regarding is all good but positioning it for a provider who writes Oxycontin it's no longer available at that point is to give them that opportunity to make that decision versus other opportunities that were in the field, okay and what were some of those opportunities do you recall this time I believe of Hannah was an opportunity for him, I can't recall so in this context then it's all go was positioned against Opana, is that Chris accurate indirectly but yes it's not stated understood all right can you read that that last full paragraph there starting with you have yes so now it's important to stay focused with your Rowdy targeting in messaging routing needs to be focused around our topdesk office issues targeting them with the right product and right message, those who have been moving up the rank report have been driving both exhaust go and Somerville business while minimizing any losses with confetti this is also plenty of time to get in the money for the do axis contest president's Club is definitely within your reach keep driving the business and believe it thank you again and I'm looking forward to seeing you at our meeting and may get selling your make president's Club at found crud no sir, very close I don't recall financially what was the benefit of making presents Club here's all their financial benefit to making President's Club, was there any benefit to making presidents Club, may seem to be dangled out there like a carrot on a stick I just curious it you shall I do,did you remark is zip 17, I gave away my copy, a zero eight eight eight three six five four, one review and let me know when you're ready,today from you to Todd Dean on April 23rd 2012 correct subject is the story gets better correct yes all right, this reference is a lunch you had with a dr. fox and Rachel pain correct that's correct okay well these were individuals on your target list this time yes sir okay and you work out that Rachel I'm sorry deductible practices dr. Fox part of it he only owned okay and was he one of your higher prescribers for your opioid products amount cried, he was in the top five top ten recount that Rachel called you to tell you she was writing her first exalted go correct that's what it says yeah and she needs to know where to send the patient, and then you told her where and then drop by that Pharmacy to let them know, act that accurate that's what it states is okay and what was the why was racial confused as to where this impatient can actually looking at the Timeline here this would have been shortly after I started with them, not many pharmacies had stalked exhaustive so you didn't want to patient is showing up at a pharmacy that didn't have the product and that's typical in the opioid space because they offered limited shelf space within the pharmacies if I knew of a particular Pharmacy that had it at this particular time as we're launching out or I am in this territory then I would have advised the prescribers to where it was located okay so is it fair to say that part of your job duties at Mound crop and sales role, all was to understand where your mail across brand opioid product was being stalked in your territory injection sure okay so that when a prescriptions written for example go there's no problem getting the prescription filled, least less problem sure Fair, and do you remember the name of the pharmacy you're going to hear no sir, okay you go on to say is an independent in the owner is there and he's really appreciative and then tells me how gets a lot of scripts from this group in Lenoir City and I need to call on them I read that correctly I believe so do you recall that conversation with the pharmacist, how do you know what group in Lenoir City that he was saying you got a lot of scripts from based on this email, not specifically it was what our city at this time part of your market so we so okay, and is this something typical that the pharmacist would let you know hey there's this practice out there they're running a lot of scripts that I'm filling you should know about that Junction that's typical with okay but wasn't a typical amount Croc wreck it wasn't a typical for opioids okay okay so this pharmacist tells you about this group in Lenoir City are running a lot of scripts and then, spawn I explained that I have tried and been met by security and so forth, every that correctly its we have States okay fact they were security there that refresh your recollection about what group were talking about in north city possibly yes and what do you believe that group was, this particular one would dwell in his name of Tanya Warwick at the bottom that was the prescriber, tiny Warwick's is the prescriber at that location and on our city okay, anything else about the location, so when you tell a pharmacist of the the pharmacy that you already tried to go but security turns you away that he said we'll just tell them that I sent you and they'll let you in so that in essence we told you that's what I've listed here yes okay so in fact he refers to is getting the red carpet treatment correct as well placed you yes okay and then, doubt that when you went back you got 26 minutes with them talking about about the product and you felt very strongly that we will see Tanya Warwick's name is a new prescriber real soon, correct you know tiny War has had other prescribers in her office and the time, she added to your target list your knowledge,oh I'm sorry, back on exhibit 16 I'm sorry 17 what was Todd Dean's response to your email, awesome, all right you've handed you what's been identified exhibit 18 or not the handed dude this is document-based mnk underscore T NS ta 0 8 9 3 3 6 5 4, number viewing please let me know,okay document to a number of individuals including yourself on June 4th 2013 correct that's correct mr. Paul chefs Key Well any reason to think you didn't receive that email on about that date, he asks, this is subject ABS algo app correct the express disseminated says they want our feedback on the new example go how you been using it value has added with your Excel go print stations Etc there's a feedback on the app is that fair okay so above you respond to mr. Poole chefs Keys email correct yes you do you respond to June 5th 2013 correct yes sir okay, just read the paragraphs starting after Dan, I have really had good conversations around the pill call out shark for the oxy patient and of course around the technology page and Polly Ox layers trip across some good conversations anytime I had mentioned that the technology offers barriers to those looking to divert the technology and try to place it into a liquid that it creates a gooey thick cardiotoxic product the immediate response in every situation is a shock one that o we must we will just kill the patient's then, for that we'll send the herds one when then drawing the comparison that oxy also contains this substance and was what recently gain favor with the FDA in their new labeling it has been mixed in and it's reviews of the provider than drawing a comparison to oxy an exhaust go which is not favorable for many standpoints here in Knoxville so I have to them back pedal and re-discuss the efficacy of a jogo and wants a one-a-day dosing, okay, let's take that paragraph little bit of time, what you refer to in the first sentence about the pill pull out sharp for the oxy patient that wasn't something included in the example Go app, is that your recollection, I don't recall specific to it but it must have been okay and that would have been a chart talking about how exotic 0 can be used to use with respect to a patient's already on an oxycontin regiment is that their Junction form Junction Foundation again I don't recall the direct correlation there okay the sentence starting any time I've mentioned that the technology offers barriers to those looking to, divert the technology, and try to place it into liquid that it creates a gooey thick cardiotoxic product, I read that correctly correct all right impact that technology offers barriers to those looking to divert the technology what you mean by that, was the barrier to those looking to divert the technology the fact that if it was if the product the exalt go was put into the liquid, tried to solve it, it turns into a gooey toxic product, injection I don't recall the specifics of that particular technology do you understand how exalted go potentially could be abused by trying to dissolve the product and either, inhale or not hail or somehow inject the product after dissolving it Junction form Foundation, no I don't recall that I do understand the other opioids products that that's one method of abuse that if the product was able to be dissolved in liquid that the active ingredient could be drawn out with syringe and injected connection form Foundation no I don't recall that okay so do you know what you were talking about when you wrote, about the technology offering a barrier to those looking to divert Direction asked and answered who's out there I don't recall specifics, okay, what about the placing into liquid that it creates a gooey thick cardiotoxic product if you mean that bad, he just says what it says there I don't recall specifically what that meant Oh the barrier to Diversion was that to prevent abuse of the drug, injection lack of foundation I don't recall that, get exotic do have of use deterrent properties not as much did not not to my knowledge okay, is are you not discussing and abuse deterrent technology in this email checks your microphone dacian asked and answered I don't recall that situation here are using firm tamper-resistant in relation to exalt go not that I recall, is the is this, technology, that enables the product to create a gooey thick cardio toxic product when placing liquid is that a tamper-resistant technology, is this technology to create a thick cardiotoxic product when placed inside the liquid is that a resistive technology Junction Foundation, not to my knowledge, did you receive a trading about, what you're describing here about is all go creating a GUI thick cardiotoxic product when placing liquid Junction I don't recall specifics, okay and then you make the comment the immediate response in every situation you talk about this toxic, product is 0 we will just kill the patient's then what you mean by that, that was a quote from whoever made that comment I don't know what they would mean by that you have no idea what they meant when they said this would well we will just kill the patient's then after hearing about the thick cardiotoxic product check she has to answer for that will thin the herds want it which mean by that, probably typo there did you mean to say or that will thin the herds that want it, actually I don't recall I don't know if you don't recall anything about why you wrote what you wrote here, the last thing that sends you right, drawing a comparison to oxy and O's all go which is not favorable for many standpoints here in Knoxville you see that we do see there okay and what did you mean by that, I specifically don't, recall what that reference, if it is all go and exhausting Oxycontin for in the providers mind equal when what they provided that could draw a comparison Asylum assume that relationship, well you call it not favorable for many standpoints correct that's what it states he says here in Knoxville, in particular yes that's okay my territory and without comparison not be favorable as far as exalt ago concerned because of the stigma associated with Oxycontin being a abuse abuse drug objection I don't recall exactly why that would have been stated well in your experience two years selling opioid products in Knoxville was there a stigma attached Oxycontin that you are aware of ejection, I believe it was we've got heard there was okay and what was the stigma you heard about tell tell us all what stigma associated with Oxycontin well know that it was specifically with oxy I think it was just with opioids and you know a stigma that, potential, abuse diversion and was that particularly heightened awareness of that Knoxville, I don't return, generally speaking you did you try to avoid comparing exha go in an oxycontin against one another one discussing the product with prescribers injection, I don't recall making comparisons discussing resolver for the appropriate patient and what is on those properties to demonstrate for them, do you recall, the source of these conversations that you refer to in this email so you recall where these quotes came from in this email which providers providers goes to you, what a likelihood comes from somewhere on your target list objection, I don't know, has your document identify as exhibit 19 it's Mak underscore T NS t a zero eight eight eight three six five two, we do get a chance to review,you're going to stocking it to emails the first page is sent from you too Todd Dean and Bo Hamilton on May 12 2012 correct that is correct subject is Advanced Pain Therapeutics of Knoxville correct and reason that you sent this email on this date, all right and you're referring to a meeting that you had with some prescribers correct see you soon and during that meeting, about two-thirds down a paragraph here's a quote start he throws out, you start reading that paragraph on that sentence starting with he throws out he throws out my drug is killing people I'm sorry let me start over I think he missed it forward my starting over he throws out how my drug is killing people, and confuses it with power down on several occasions but we went through the data discuss the conversions answered his questions and at the end he gets up and tells me that I have been very honest individual with him and he appreciate that that and then walks towards me and gave me a hug the bit unnerved but nonetheless of on a bound was made in that first call okay that's good, a comment he throws out how my drug is killing people you're afraid to exalt over there, I believe so, did you get any more information from the doctor as to why he told you his drawer drug was killing people, can you believe it the doctor was simply confused when he said your product was killing people he was really referred to another product that's your understanding that would be my understanding this doctor is dr. Gollum Gollum Reza sure Eevee okay, and was this Clinic that you were visiting was it the advanced pain therapy works of Knoxville according to the subject yes okay and you know dr. Rosenberg has referred to in this paragraph you're calling dr. Rosenberg any other time during your tenure at Mallinckrodt not to my knowledge okay that was right here dr. Rosenberg was arrested three months after this email was sent,Angie document labeled the vic-20 your deposition Bait Stand mnk underscore T NS ta 08 933 804, overdoing it let me know please, oh wait I read the wrong thing in the record I apologize, I'm sorry I meant to say exhibit 20 is coming K underscore T NS ta 089 3409 to, you know when you're finished, on this date of July 25th 2013 over the past few weeks but he's coming to a problematic standpoint now, over the past few weeks I have had providers mention that they are having a few issues getting exalted o at the pharmacy parentheses something not new or uncommon and we just mean digging into the pharmacies a bit deeper, but then comment started being made that patients were having trouble getting their meds of any kind and if some of my key offices had actually broken contract to allow patients the ability to find their man's anywhere they could in digging more into the pharmacies the past week and a half I have found out that all pharmacies in my area are having problems getting their opioids and from the wholesalers I had been told that the DEA has been involved through limiting quantities that is being shifted to the Knoxville area we were such, hi the use this is not only going to have a significant impact on my business but the overall Market as well I have both a CVS and a grocery store chain try and see if I came in with an example script could they order it for me both said they could not that it would exceed their percentage of scheduled to use to all scripts order by the pharmacy this week I really am at a loss on what I can actually do and other factors are now putting the screws on the area due to the high abuse we have here, this is more than protective protecting the script and getting a pharmacy to order an exorbitant, you recall who told you, that the DEA has been involved in limiting quantities as being shipped into the Knoxville area due to such high abuse, no not specifically did you hear that for more than one person, objection I don't recall it was that ever common knowledge to your to understanding objection to me do you remember having a general understanding when worked in Mallinckrodt that shipments of opioids being restricted by the DEA coming in to Knoxville due to higher, rates of abuse and Knoxville objection you know it's not my understand, if any idea was understand came from then as expressed in this email,it is says what it says and it appears to be limited to that timeframe of July 25th 2013 so I don't know specifically what was going on at that time and Knoxville did you believe what you wrote here was true and accurate the DEA had been involved in limiting quantities opioids being shifted to Knoxville to to high rates of abuse ejection lack of foundation Sims of fact I do, I don't recall what I would have thought at that point you don't know whether you believe the tiny made this statement whether that was accurate same objections I don't know if it was active or Not Looking Back and I don't know if you ever did you ever learn later that the your observation here about the DEA limiting shipment of opioids in to Knoxville due to high rates of abuse was accurate, did you ever hear about the limiting shipments of opioids in to Knoxville due to high rates of abuse was accurate answer I don't recall that, observation here I really am at a loss on what I can actually do when other factors are now putting the screws on the area due to the high abuse we have here through that correctly States okay what are the other factors that you refer to here now putting the screws on the area due to the high abuse we have here, Junction I don't recall what those other factors would have been, and you say due to the high abuse we have here are you reporting someone else's observation or is that your observation, that would not be my observation I never observed that, so you're saying as of the date of this email July 25th 2013 you didn't have an opinion as to whether or not opioid abuse was relatively high in the Knoxville area, not specifically in Knoxville again to our comment earlier something common knowledge across the United States had been for a long time, did you ever have understanding working at Mallinckrodt weather, hope your abuse in Appalachia was higher relative to the nation as a whole Justin something that you do not recall being aware of it at any point working for Mallinckrodt Junction I never recall hearing the word Appalachia what about just in Tennessee do you recall strike that do you recall whether you had the understanding why you worked at mallik Road, got that rates of abuse of opioids in Tennessee was higher relative to the rest of the nation, which action no comparison your goal having understanding where you worked at Mallinckrodt whether the piece rate for opioids with relatively higher in East Tennessee compared to other areas in the nation, would having some understanding about the abuse rates in Knoxville, or upper east Tennessee or Tennessee in general, whatever something you'd be considered valuable knowledge, why you were selling melon krauts popular product in your Knoxville market share action, no sir, why would that not have been valuable to you, traction because I prescribed educated positions on these all go for an appropriate patient that's not an appropriate patient, it's being used, do you ever make an effort, to try and gain some awareness or understanding about opioid abuse rates in Knoxville relative to the rest of the nation, objection, and that was never Strike that the rate of abuse of opioid products in Knoxville or Tennessee generally, there were a topic of, training or instruction for Mal Grand gesture, hope you would abuse with topic of training because that was part of the Black Box warning so yes it was part of the training my question is specific though to the rate of abuse of opioid products at Knoxville Tennessee was that in topic of training or instruction from a Lacroix checks into the Tennessee being singled out, what's protecting the script mean, I'm not sure exactly what I would have meant then, today that would to me I felt understanding that, wanted to make sure the prescription was able to go through that a buzz term or phrase that was used frequently at Mallinckrodt protect the script no not that I recall you'll recall seeing it in other emails or Communications from Alcott employees Jackson, I don't recall, last two, let's take a short break we going off the Record at 5:48, okay we're back on the record and 556 if you are you know how much longer do you think we had I just said I had two more documents that's it the scorecard robots say we have two more documents thank you for hanging in there I really appreciate it, I've handed you a document which is identified exhibit 21 your deposition this is based and M and K underscored and sta 08 935 207, a chance to review the document let me know,these are series of emails the first in the sequence is email to you from Dan pull a chef ski on September 9 2013 at 7:22 a.m. do you see that attaches something called Chris Clark fcr 2013. D OC X is that a field call report will contact with her feel content report okay great, the email immediately above that you make a statement in here second sentence I had Teddy call me yesterday to let me know she had been fired because not of work to others are currently on the Block as well you could have my teddy is my titties was a nurse practitioner at getting Health Care, was Teddy's actual name she was 4 and I can't I couldn't tell you without looking it up okay, your accounting of conversation you have a Teddy on a phone call that let you know she had been fired and that potentially to others have beard will be fired correct according to that yes and you make then it can you read that the rest of that paragraph when I inquired as to why she was fine and the others close to being she stated that many of them want to do what is right blowing pill counts do using exhaust go, and dismissing patients that test with illegal drugs in your system she was told by the owners who are chiropractors that is running patient's up that is running patients off and that each patient needs to receive and quote ample amount of oxy Roxy Toro Panama to keep them happy and

hfhb0039,"what we'll do is just start in this is so I can figure out who you guys are when we get home if you get to start by stating your name once I start service, you can start to resent my name is Theresa I live here in Safety Harbor wood on wood brand of cigarettes do you smoke well instant Light 100's or Darrell Island hundredths okay and how long have you been smoking like would say Winston and that combination a combination probably 15 years more 15 years ago it's always Winston yeah yeah well I started off and I was, it with Carrington's the different ones put one since I've slept in what about you dad changed and I'm from st. Pete I smoked camel Lite 100s I've been smoking them now for about 1215 years ever switch around between Brands just kind of regulars the light and in between test thinking basically camel okay how did y'all did you guys come in and go to a group with a lot of other people it's both of you haven't okay, at that if you remember back then they were talking about what it's like to be a smoker today and kind of how people's attitudes have changed towards smokers have you personally either one of you notice that practically okay like go ahead and I mean what is it like to be a smoker and safety today and how has it changed recently not so much in st. Pete but I travel their planes with the days when you could smoke you had to set in the back of the plane but even now an airport you, physically leave the airport in order to have a cigarette and you got to go back to security and all the hassles of kinda run for planes and get your lack of 80 and then you got the smoking cars non-smoking cars I've converted a few okay what about you Teresa mean what's it like well I notice right now you can't smoke them off if you want to smoke we have to learn to go outside and if you do smoke anywhere by just looks that you liked him dirt on your face, you're something you know bad person the smoke was just as the reacting to what do you think, oh secondhand smoke probably this is such a big deal that right now are that mainly here's the main thing I see also they don't like the odor or the the smoke they plainly make its knees or irritates her nose or what have you and they don't like the smell on their clothes okay I'm curious in either either one of y'all can go go on this one when you first before you got to try this cigarette before you get the first, try of a Cliffs and you start hearing about it and you were sitting in that group I mean what kind of thoughts are going through your mind what we what were you thinking trees yeah I thought was a good idea it just you know smoke for me odor free I thought I was pretty good idea did you have any integer anticipate anything as far as like what it would taste like or, before I try to change my voice right now I just feel you're just interested yeah yeah I just thought the concept was really nice yeah what about you damn what were you thinking yeah I think the concepts excellent that it's basically trying to help out the defenseless smokers this point it ain't like basically turning your son to closet smokers when you guys get the comments they don't mind you smoking just don't exhale but I thought it was very unique, meek and a new wave of where the smokers going to go I was concerned about the flavor and it tastes because primarily that's what I like about it but the camels I do find a difference between camels Winston's and lights and Ultras and those kind of things that I've tried in the past that was pretty important also what do you think did you have a night did you guess like what it would taste like no no I I tried both the Menthol Island and I'm going to fall just to try both of them during, class I used to smoke cools years ago the irritated my throat put me back to the non menthols okay what and I'll just keep going with you Dan what was it like them that first time I think you got to try and in those groups as what did you think the other startup was tough you know basically they told us that was like a cigar and of the women fared because they don't fucking smoke too many cigars but you got to really draw hard to get it going, and to me it seemed like I had to draw a hard to keep it going the flavor was different what I kind of turned it back to was like like when they're Fantage first came out it had a like a twang to it and a little bit of a bite and that's probably the only thing that really would be negative on my side would be the flavor leaves a little bit after bike, kind of like maybe smoking a cigar, okay what about you Teresa what was your I mean when you were in there and you try to counsel well it was awfully hard to life is hard to smoke and it's like some kind of smoke all over again that it's real hard to smoke what did you think about the taste when you finally tasted well I normally smoke like cigarettes and the light when I try there's no flavor at all because I didn't think that was so I went back to try the full flavor that's a little better, okay that much not much not much now now I'm not I like the whole idea that I really do and I hope they can improve on it somehow but it's too hard to smoke you smoke at you just like I'm on a cigarette now I want a real cigarette I think I'm playing so it's your case is not really satisfying yeah I totally agree I smoked them with my camels you know I'll tell you the alternating back and forth, It's like what like playing yeah it's like okay now I want to put my break now or a real cigarette yeah what now how much you took two packs of them I think as a first step right and then a carton or did you just take the car just the car card okay so both of you have some of the carton you didn't know okay I can't ask you this when you smoke the car, what did you notice anything different like the people notice that this it was a different kind of cigarette that you show it to anybody I got a lot of comments everybody that was near me when I was smoking had a comment it was very much A Conversation Piece a couple folks had to try it never quite finished it the biggest thing was Secretaries Day was that week and we had non smoker smoking, the girls that don't smoke or when I post with lunch and we went for going to go to a non-smoking table for then we got the smoking table and I'm passing these out amongst the people that place and the restaurant kind of thought maybe what are they smoking in passing around over there because we were all talking and really going on about the cigarettes and really became a attraction of like eight people in the corner of Steak and Ale so it they they commented like the same thing it's too hard to do, draw part about a few comments that got everybody's attention about how hard to have to draw did anyone in particular I mean did was there a range was there anyone that would just liked it that right there any I don't think so they all the smokers preferred they were are all like Winston regulars Winston selects they smoke the regular not the lights and the girls don't smoke at all they were ever kind of they weren't gagging enough, thing but they never like this is different they all thought it was unique that we laid in the ashtray and there wouldn't be any smoke or the thing that they never got smaller as like how do you know when you're done, how do you how would you answer something like that if someone asked you how do you know what I've done basically I said there's no more smoke left I had several it tried to relight it and nothing came out and now you're done okay just a second, let me just, you were talking about when you know they're done you were talking about when you when you know it was done or when you don't do these let's say I'm here your friend I come up and I say well they last as long as a normal cigarette so pretty much I put the three to five minutes is basically what I saw and what they told us it would last and that's about what it lasted I didn't really try the thing they said you could lay it down for two or three minutes and pick it back up generally I don't blame my cigarettes, down even even normal ones generally hold on to him and I draw them more often than that but I found the last about 45 minutes what about you Teresa did you get an opportunity to show these to anybody I think your way, how's the girls that wear I didn't like them of course as long as they only had 12 pack on my first impression was good what do you how do you I mean what would you say to him whenever they see it first or would you say hey look at this new cigarette well they knew I was coming here to start with for the survey and so they wanted to try it and, what they thought of it to anyone or I was really interested in like how do you how did you start the conversation and say hey guess what yeah what time with your survey and they understand the cigarette smoke free no ashes and what were their reactions there were always the same no one really yeah I'll be okay and what was the biggest was it taste now because you had to draw too hard on you really I mean, give it a light in it they can get anything at all and I'm your smoke on it have to be lighted and play with the quite a bit to get it to light up the women that had to try to have more problems with the taste and then was worried about him going out some of them thirst thought that was a cigarette load in the end it's going to blow up it's a gag cigarette maybe like don't like I'm smoking one you're waiting and you're waiting he's pretty good, do you is this something I can address me earlier today when we were talking with it that a lot of non are we're getting a lot of pressure smokers are getting a lot of pressure from the fact that there's a secondhand smoke and this is a gret is able to reduce secondhand smoke a lot is it you know where does it come fit into the picture of what's going on out there today and I like we're talking about earlier as a cigarette that does reduce secondhand smoke, Italy where where does this fit in I think of restaurants main issue with areas that are basically going smoke-free totally The Smokers aren't taking the business they're they're going elsewhere I think they would try to track that business back I know for a fact many airports with lounges in the bars where they used to crowd everybody to smoke that they would make you you couldn't stand and smoke yet that have a Coke appear or something, spending money now these lounges are empty when I walk through them now they're really being hurt or business is down 40 to 60% from the bartender's I've talked to and they're kind of lobbying to get smoking back because the tip money do you think this plate would play a role in there yes I think that would isolate that area again where we used to be with the crowded smoke-filled rooms that would be reduced down because that seemed to be the biggest complaint that wasn't the Smoke Filled rooms they would still allow us to, set there and smoke, what about you Teresa you see this the cigarette but what I don't think it will I don't think anybody's gonna it's non-smoking now I don't think they'll ever go back and say okay you can smoke if you smoke this new cigarette I don't see that ever happening what about I mean you guys have it sounds like most people that you showed it to really didn't like it that much, I'm curious in the group that you were in when you came in here and talk to that what was the reaction of the group do you remember next time what who do you think the cigarette is for who do you think would like to cigarette it you can you think anybody people smoke in their own homes they don't like it if you have kids maybe new smoke in the house they'll like it or people that smoke in the car because they don't want the glitter in the car, under green okay um is this a cigarette that if you were going to want to put that you're watching this video and you're working back from Winston-Salem on this this cigarette getting the clips ready do you Market this cigarette, this is a cigarette that should be out on the market because it reduces the second hand smoke by seven lines and has some benefits to he's check-in I'm going to improve it a little first make it easier to like make it easier lines of you know it's easier to smoke somehow enhance the flavor I think it's very well Market, do you think it's from marketable right now if we put it on the market tomorrow to think of itself probably not the they would initially go because of the concept and uniqueness but primarily I smoked for the flavor that's not so much the drawing on it or the toughness but the flavor of feeling it satisfied my craving okay Teresa you said that you had showed it to, see people I guess at work right did you show it to anybody else or did I'm curious did anyone stop either one of you two and actually notice it without you bringing it up yes it is tell me about that how does that happen and what was what went on like what kind of conversation went on well this fellow is a nonsmoker and his wife smokes and he's basically kind of rides her all the time and he rides the used to be our plant manager and I was sitting directly beside him and he was noticing, saying that I wasn't burying him to smoke because he generally tries to scoot away from you like we smoke it I started telling him about it and he fixed it up and thought what kind of kind of neat course I told her put down on the napkin to look as any burning anything he thought it was pretty neat idea, but his thoughts ours no smoking at all he's quick 30 years ago or whatever and he's preaching to his wife to quit I did find that during that time period of that week I smoke probably 30 to 40% more than I normally would because I had the interim of my camels in between which is back to that satisfaction thing, okay so I'm curious let's say out of the cities around on the market today would you buy an average week how much they how many cigarettes how many packs do you smoke a day one pack two facts are about to practice Japan okay added so that means seven days just about 14 packs out of this 14 packs which is smoked any eclipse the pack of eclipses are numb during the period of the 10 packs of Clips I smoke probably five, two six-packs of camels along with which is a little bit more than what I generally spoke is how it varies from time to time because we're smokeless at work and depending on if I'm outside of our plan or not I smoke more or I smoked half of them's which increases the Pack level today of a smoking area at your work I mean like a slight a designated smoking area yes did you smoke any of these eclipses in there what were people saying I mean people, just that you were smoking they want to try him so maybe I didn't smoke as many of the of the full carton I did probably passed out during that interval maybe up to two packs during that time frame when you gave the cigarettes to people what would you say to just try it around to explain like the fact that parents sometimes I would tell them because they would see the white pack or the no name on it like what are they expand they start asking questions and some I would answer in some I would like to find out in the room and just asked what they thought of them, and do my own little survey and and so that's what you were talking about earlier we're not not in I guess no one liked them so your flavor they didn't care for the growing part is about it but other than that they sell they like the uniqueness the single ones thought they were vague great conversation pieces of bringing up conversation, and of course others that have the spouse at home that doesn't like that the smoke thought it was great, but they didn't back to The Taste and hard to draw Sierra, what which of the government's attitude be toward Reynolds in this cigarette should because right now the government's pretty clear on how they stand on smoking I mean you can't smoke in any public buildings airports like you had mentioned the military you can't smoke in the military anymore which of the government's position Beyond cigarette like this should it be any different than any other cigarette like they were probably going to a bunch of testing, the biggest factor is the the glycerin difference in the tar and nicotine there are pushing for my house standpoint on the individual as well as the second hand smoke and driving it with the secondhand smoke people, okay what do you what do you think I mean what does it what should what stations from government, is there any different than any other cigarette how they should research it I think make sure it's okay but I do think that we should be like to smoke somewhere course of what say you and I can't see them saying you can smoke the eclipse in this little area but you can't smoke in one instance I don't think that's right at all I don't think I'll do that, I guess it's it unless guys do you have any questions mark thank you all I hope that what you think",0.8144895446000001,0.59486103,0.9128388

Khan plumber it, this is today to find a mascot for a new brand of cigarettes right what's your angle I'll buy that let's do lunch who does she think she's dealing with hmm now then we're looking for someone who represents cool you don't have what it takes actually Rock I think I'm pretty versatile have you ever thought about the way to back a company's betray people who smoke their brand of cigarette well let's take a look at this, this ad from the past where you have a beautiful lady long luscious legs curvaceous and Bodacious body in a beautiful blue bikini standing on a package of cigarettes it seems that women who smoke are an object of sex but that was not always the case did you know that at the turn of the century it was in fact illegal for women to smoke in public so next time you pick up an American Magazine containing an ad saying you've come a long way baby you should ask yourself how do you come a long way have you liberated your cell phone, the laws of the past or have you just exchange it for a new type of repression and addiction and what about this side here we have a now that makes it seem that smoking after a long workout is actually a healthy choice I find that ironic don't you okay so Society has now said no more smoking the workplace number smoking the malls no more smoking in the community centers, and what have the tobacco companies come and then it seems that they're directly answering this type of restriction it seems that they're saying go ahead cheat smoke in the workplace just hang that cigarette out the window it's okay no one will notice and if you can't find a place to kick back and have one last drag you can always put down to Joe's place where there's music there's dancing there's pool and can always find people who smoke just like you so the next time you pick up an American Magazine containing tobacco a, dad's you should ask yourself what images are the tobacco companies trying to sell you, can't you buy into the images and Lifestyles that tobacco companies present no I don't want to be the Marlboro Man when I first started smoking I think that the I did buy into the images over totally like manipulative whenever you see a cigarette ad it's always young healthy people having a good time relaxing sort of a thing to make it look a little refreshing the cool things that don't think what the average smoker they have Lego yellow teeth in our fingers they smell gets into the, clothes and their hair and mucus and coughs I hope I don't ever get like that maybe I'll be able to put it for that, anyway when I started smoking you know it's great sport glad I'm preparing Bogart smoke Clark Gable Cary Grant, very romantic, so you smoke all right we've got G simple Toronto Jason hello how you doing man you're on what's up nothing much I think he feels pretty cool hey there's a lot better right so we want got a question comment I think the ad where the people are diving into the pool so ineffective it's really stupid right now what do you think is ineffective about that story I said what do you think is in effect of about that what bothers you about that, I don't think it will stop people from smoking mmm it's just a dumb message right okay well one thing that I think they wanted people to think about when they made that ad is that it will not make anybody stop smoking I think that you smoke yourself Jason no okay well I think there's a lot of people who when they see an ad like that it's not meant so much to stop somebody from smoking but more to get somebody who might big might start smoking to maybe think twice before doing it I think that a you know like a lot of guys they look at that and say okay yeah sure, and then I'm going to do anything about that right is a good look at it laughs but the find a lot of younger people how will you I'm 13 okay I can see how you might find a lot of guys you know preteens you know 11 12 they look at that and make me think twice about about smoking so just something to think about all right his record I appreciate it okay thanks all right right now we're going to take Ken from Stratford Ken hello all right can what's up man not or what all right you got a question comment I got a comment it's kind of like Jason's right I kind of find Those ads that say smoking is really, a bad kind of offenses right y so well with my friends even said the same thing about it is me not like that one I decide you put on a boat I was about 10 minutes ago right let's go well with the people jumping into the water right thing all these chemicals and everything in there hmm do you really think your salt that they have smokes have all those chemicals in them well this is true I mean there are a lot of chemicals that there are like tons of chemicals in cigarettes I mean that's what makes it addictive I think that's one of the things that they want people to know about because, fact that cigarettes are how do you say Well they're

the error of RJR McDonald incorporated as export a that's Vantage that's McDonald specials think about it guys we got a call Karen from Bradford yeah hi hey you don't care I'm pretty good I was just wondering why like most of the smoking add that I seem like around there are all directed towards young women and girls and I think that's kind of like I don't see all girls smoking I see a lot of guys smoking to so which adds any particular ad you think is, and specifically a girls well mostly like Virginia Slims well pretty well I seen we did a unit on smoking in school and we studied a lot of advertisements right and most of them were directed at young women right we see what they're doing is that they're trying to play off this thing where women need to be this is their way of being empowered and it is a crock I think I mean maybe you like to come in on this well yeah they have that their slogan is you've come a long way baby as if cigarettes have have, brought about social change for women which is silly women did it on their own they don't need cigarettes to become independent or liberated you see so I mean if you really want to show that women are empowered when you take your power clock him in the head they're idiots all right they for the call we appreciate it we can take another phone call we've got Mike from Sudbury Mike that's your Batman I'll be you pretty good all right can you turn down your TV little bit little bit of feedback are not be out here man you got a question comment I got a comment all right I was just saying that, moti Add feel like to the younger generation so I've been like smoking since I was like a little kid right and I just like steak everybody wants to smoke this like don't try to anything because it will ruin your life huh and I think that's pretty stupid for everybody who tries it right and like all the commercials they should be feel like the older generation to try to quit right and not just to the younger generation if you could change one thing in advertising what would you do I would just make it for older people, we're a man thanks a lot appreciate the call they take care of him and what do you think about that I think cigarette advertising is definitely directed to young kids especially Joe Camel there's big controversy over his he's a cartoon character you know and who reads cartoons yeah precisely as a matter of fact is a fact that ever since Joe Camel the cartoon cows being used the people like young kids were recognizing that from 1 percent to 30 percent like 30% higher and that's quite a fact right now it's, for mister conglomerates, what's your angle I'll buy that let's do lunch yeah whenever freezes over so let me get this straight you want to be our new mascot right the other guys already have someone who looks just like you you're wasting my time my hump isn't it well this is what I get when I listen to my agent and larger hump she says you'll get more work cigarette ads are banned in Canada but a loophole in the law still allows tobacco companies to use their corporate logo when sponsoring events that's one heck of a loophole, the hidden ways that the great companies promote their products are like putting their name on cultural events such as more digestible through sporting events layers and Rahman sponsored tenant in 1991 the Canadian tobacco industry spent more than 40 million dollars on cultural programs and projects hydrogen cyanide what do these deadly poisonous have in common, Mayhem they are some thousands of chemicals found in a widely used

companies really don't care about your, your health or what you're about they just want to make money and that's really what all they're interested in not at all if anybody gets a chance on that topic I want you guys to take a peek at yesterday's Sunday star it's a great article by Judy Steed and we appreciate her giving us the opportunity to show this on air take a look at this yesterday it's like

seeing all these, as and stuff in magazines Etc and if they always portray young people as being cool if they smoke and getting lots of friends and I just want to say that that is just so untrue I mean I see a lot of people at my school they just sort of stay away from people smoke because I mean they stink and everything and I just don't think it's pretty horrible the way that weight they portrayed as being cool to smoke right it's not that precisely I think you just hit the nail right on the head man thanks for the call we appreciate it right, now it's time for The Adventures of

pretty extensive at the work out for a while because first tied up okay I think that's right as you can see we've got a cigarette that's being pushed into the earth the earth is kind of an ashtray we appreciate this kind of stuff want to keep this kind of stuff come in and write because we really enjoy can see that here just a little bit like it loving it all right Amy we were looking at some of the images that we see in advertising now let's talk about, movies now we do this in a lot of movies recent movies old movies that smoking is glorified smoking looks well you said let's do one moving particular Blade Runner Blade Runner was Sean young boy she gorgeous and and she looks so good I'm sure she'd like to put a million cigarettes during that movie and she just looks so cool smoking and she doesn't get cancer Midway through the movie and she looks cool throughout the whole thing with that cigarette in her mouth I mean like what kind of images I mean that you know as somebody who smokes mean do you when you look at that and you see that, image like what registers in your mind was that like triggered oh smoking is beautiful smoking is cool and you know when you're sitting at parties or whatever and there's like a cute guy whatever across the room you know you're doing the whole you know type actress type thing and you know it really is you sort of associate coolness with movies like that that's another movie were talking about where the Lethal Weapon movies you know Mel Gibson Danny Glover you know the voice and it's like every second seat you see Mel Gibson in is a no-smoking sign in the, background and he's like just popping his guard puffing away hotel and he's it's like the same thing for men you know he's a total rugged Man you know on his own stands up fights evil people you know and so he sort of portrays that that image for boys a movie there was thinking of Superman he flies into the Marlboro trips no mistake yeah and that's like totally manipulatives you'll find that in a lot of movies what advertisers are doing is that they're buying spots in the movies to show their cigarettes show their products and what, want to do that is that it's their own free advertising they stick it in to them although they are paying a lot of money it was just recently that it came out that someone Sylvester Stallone's movies that huge wads of money were being paid in order to get their cigarette brands into the movie in a Superman to you've got the the Man of Steel he's brewing his way out of a Marlboro cigarette truck and does just the image of you know him coming out Supernatural Superfly super cool breaking through it's something that really wears on kids and so I think we really have to think about, there are so many other movies as well I'm thinking about some of the James Bond movies as well like cigarettes they paid something like six figures in order to get those like cigarettes put into the movie now you look at this kind of stuff and you say alright this manipulation it's it's so blatantly obvious it's not that they have to look at and movies in advertising as well as you know in the magazines and something to remember something to think about now we've been looking at a lot of the images and a lot of the themes that I mean as far as the, smoking ads what would you consider a good smoking that well I really like that one from California the one where they're all sitting around the table and saying you know we're not in this for our health type thing some I guess I guess telling you what's in cigarettes that the anti-smoking ads that tell you what since I got sort of are pretty effective for sort of prevention and stuff like that right but I'm not I mean for me I like to know more about sir, out of what what cigarette companies try to do to manipulate you know I think that would help me quick cool and Terry oh you're jamming our line so I think we'd better get the stick girl hit it, this, so what's your angle I'll buy that let's do lunch there's another quick million dollars it just never lets up around here I like your style kid I think we can cut a deal that sounds swell when can I start hold

going to have a much easier time moving people are saying no don't do it it's bad to make any smoking messages they had to be a little bit more effective you can't just stop right only by looking at 20 years people have been doing a lot of commercials on smoking no matter what smoking drinking or drugs people are still doing it I mean it's not effective at all I think that the anti-smoking campaigns are really working because they scare people both people who do not smoke now and he's currently I think it's your decision whether you smoke or not and I don't think anybody can persuade, you you will or you won't your choice that's disgusting cigarette butts",0.8286639716438357,0.6640581,0.9128392
hfxh0257,"okay, so this is an email between you and Victor Borelli and the email Adam interested in is on five six four three two seven and five six four three two eight and the starting Bates numbers M and Katie 1564 327 so could you review that email for completes you, okay so this email is from Victor to you and he says Kate I was thinking about our conference call this morning with John Adams and I wanted to Circle back with you on both instances in which you say I did things that compromised your trust in me and see that I do you recall receiving this email from Victor I do okay and what do you recall about this email I don't recall the content of the email but I do remember I remember having this conversation we had a call with him and with John Adams that morning, I didn't remember that I didn't remember the context but I do remember making the statement of losing trust with Vic and then him sending this email to me later in the evening at 9:30 so I remember this situation occurring for sure and do you recall why you why you indicated that you lost trust in him that's the part that I that I was more vague on I'm reading it and he gives he gives the reasons why which give, recollection but I wouldn't have remembered this otherwise but do you do recall a phone conversation with him and John Adams Adams were you indicated that you were I was upset I was I was upset about something yes okay and it caused you to lose trust in him so that it caused me to question a decision that he had made yes okay, did you have any concerns that he was providing information with his distributor customers that you shouldn't be so do you read the paragraph, they kept asking it so it looks like we if you read the email it says the second instance was more recent than was on the shipment status of the Masters recent large oxy 30 mg orders and this was on June 5th and so that's you know a day after, the The Exchange that we have on June 4th internally so we were holding these orders we weren't shipping them at the time because we were trying to determine you know determine if we could take on the business what we were going we were going to do and we had asked according to him, we had asked to keep that you know we were trying to have that conversation internally before we communicated anything to the customer and looks like from this email, he went ahead and move forward with telling Masters the discussions that we are having now you had asked him not to do this correct wide said that we wanted to according to this it looks like I had said we wanted to keep the conversations internal, I don't remember the conversation specifically but based on his response that appears to be what I had said and you don't have any reason to believe that his characterization of the second instance is inaccurate, can you explain what you mean well you do you recall asking him to keep your confidence your internal conversations confidential I I don't like I said I don't recall that but reading his response indicates that that's what I had said okay and you don't have any reason to believe he would be lying about that no because I remember I remember this conversation at least high level okay, and so you would ask them to keep information confidential and he apparently disregarded that request that fair he went ahead and shared with the customer he has to do you recall other instances where he did that this one particular step with me I don't have a recollection of other occasions, but is it fair to say that as a general matter you had some concerns about his reliability Visa Vee they can get the information he was sharing with his customers I checked him yeah I don't think that we can we can say that based on this this one email exchange I and I don't this like I said this one instance I do remember that I don't have any recollection of others, but you were certainly upset about this instance weren't you, I was upset yes and I mean John Adams was Vector barelli's boss that's correct so it was it was sufficient concerned you that you raised this with him I think you know and I do remember this conversation this is 2008 so I would have been, 29 years old this point and I think back on this actually because this was something that stuck with me through my career this conversation and I think a lot of, it might have just been maturity be honest with you well you say that this this conversation or something while I'm sorry you your testimony is because this was something that stuck with me through my career this conversation so this this conversation stuck with you through your career so I remember it yes unlike a lot of the things that we review today where it was there is not a from recollection sure so what made this conversation stick with you I think because I realized that you really, I think as I realized the relevance of calling someone out that that hard and not having it in front of their boss and not having a direct conversation with them so I think that that was a Miss on on my part in terms of how I handled it and that's something that stuck with me and I'm sure you have those two or you thought about things that you could have done differently and handled differently and it impacts how you manage those relationships going forward, so what what sticks out at you is your reaction yes 100% yeah that's why I didn't really remember the content of it but I remembered this this happening, and actually looking looking at the sentences or the bottom of 5643 27 and the top of five six four three two eight, when I was discussing the server with Masters I explained to them that their order size immediately raised concerns throughout our entire organization they understood the rationale behind this based on their purchasing history but their bone of contention was that they weren't getting any direction or information about their orders they kept asking probing me with more questions about why customer service didn't get back to them and why nobody can get back to them that sought answers on their order status so in response to to Victor sharing with them these internal discussions did man, stirs complaint, Masters had Place their orders and we had not shipped the orders and customer service was not communicating to them status so it appears that according to this that they complain to Victor about not having an update on what was happening with their orders, do you recall why you wanted this conversation we cure these conversations we kept confidential because we hadn't made a decision yet on what we were going to do and so until we had that we didn't want to communicate yay or nay to Masters on what was happening and Victor as a national account manager wanted to ship and he, take to the farm, yeah I can't speak to what Victor wanted to do is Victor's job in sales I was in marketing and so I can't speak to what he wanted to do but he did have an account asking where their orders were and he they didn't have answers and he was getting a lot of pressure from from them to have answers, and so would one reason for him to share this information with Masters which prompted Masters to you know start complaining be to you know put apply some pressure to make a decision and ship the order object to the form yeah I think that's there's a lot of speculation there I can't I can't speak to to what Victor you know what he did or didn't feel or do on this, but the end result is that you know putting aside the emails the order did ship, did it, I don't think we have any documentation actually showing that the order shipped,so this email chain is from June 6 of 2008 and this email chain is as of September 15 2008 Yes and I can just read into the record it's enemy Katie 1562 745 and it's an email exchange between you and Victor Borelli another things and you right to em you're way too energetic about this shipping thing and part of his response is you know ship ship ship so previously you had indicated that Victor was, if you recall that my did characterized and that way when our initial conversations this morning and he was aggressive in trying to serve service his distributor customers Affair he advocated for his customers okay I guess what I'm asking you though is you asked me specifically now it's me that's going to get specific but you asked me specifically on whether this order shipped and then you produce this document and know this document doesn't address whether that order, okay that's why I thought you were that was the question that I had for you in terms of it you know so yes it to clarify that this this document doesn't indicate whether that orders shipped okay I have another document to be be honest I haven't found it so okay moving on yeah you know my question is just about you know Victor Borelli and his aggressiveness which I believe you indicated sure do you believe he was more aggressive than other National count, managers or were they kind of had the same objective and the same the same you know approach um I think they all had very individual approaches to how they manage their accounts but they were all focused on the relationship with the distributor and the including you know shipping the product to them they were yes they were there to manage the relationship with the customer and Advocate on their behalf, yeah that was their job to manage that relationship and so did some degree was there some tension between the national account managers and the compliance Department I can't speak to that I wasn't part of compliance so I don't know if there was or wasn't tension there, did you ever observe any tension in your role as essentially you know conduit or an information provider to compliance I honestly I don't don't recollect know, so this is an email from Kathy Stewart to Bill Ratliff and caring car per your Nazi seat on it but I did want to ask about the very top so the top email is an email from Kathy Stewart to go and Karen and she says FYI the customer service reps all state that Victor will tell them anything they want to hear just so you get the sale dot dot dot dot dot okay do you see that I do okay you agree with that statement I I don't know because I wasn't in customer service, okay then this is my first time seeing this document as I was not involved in this conversation, do you recall any concerns, by anyone regarding, Victor and you know the accuracy reliability of the information he was providing the context of I really thought I really don't have a recollection around that and like I said this is the first time that I've, scene, yeah I don't have any recollection no well you know Kathy Stewart though right do you think that you would generally reliable, I can only speak to my interactions with her but I think you know when we spoke I think she's she is a yeah I think she's reliable and she cared about the company then she I think we all did I can't speak to to Kathy specifically,so this is an email between you and Victor vasarely and then Victor vasarely and Stephen Cochran it is MKT 1384 139, and do you know who mr. Cochran is or was I do who was he he was the buyer at Key Source okay and so you are providing Victor Borelli with chargeback information on oxy 30 aren't you yeah can you just give me an opportunity because it's hard to read and respond on just a second,okay, so this email involves chargeback data or chargeback information chargeback data was considered confidential at mallik Road wasn't it, I don't know the answer to that, I don't know so do you don't have any recollection as to whether Mallinckrodt was willing to share its chargeback data with other Market participants we typically would not share competitive chargeback data with customers and so when Victor Borelli is email is forwarding this information to Cochran and he says p as shh I mean is that mean that that's because he wasn't supposed to be providing him with this information was he, I can't I'm not sure, let's see here, mmm, okay, so is this another example of mr. Borelli sharing information with a distributor client that he shouldn't be talked on the phone I can't I don't know I'm not sure well this email chain indicates that he didn't ask you if you could share this definitely you know it does indicate that yes,I don't know if we had a conversation on this it I don't I don't recollect this okay and I'm sorry just to sort of clarify the question yes sir the the email chain does not indicate that he was he ever asked you if he could share this he didn't not and he did not be an email within this chain right and you don't recall him asking you in a phone conversation I don't have a recollection of this entire email chain so I don't recollect if there was or wasn't a phone call, so thank you can you can put that document aside, so in terms of I mean, recognize that we've been we've been going at this for some time and over the course of this deposition we've reviewed numerous documents relating to the relating to suspicious orders do you recall that, we have reviewed a lot of documents yes so in terms of your you were the product manager for oxycodone from 2008 to January 2011 correct so that's around a three-year time period okay do you recall how many suspicious orders suspicions order reviews that you are involved in no I don't recall terms of a rough estimate could it be would you say it's 100 I, I seriously I that is really difficult for me to estimate I can't do that well okay presumably it's more than like 20 though right it would be more than 20 okay, fair to say more than 50 I think at this point it would be really difficult for me to give you a good estimate if I managed a product for two and a half years I think it would be really challenging given the number of orders that are processed even within let's say a given week I think it would be really challenging for me to I I can't estimate that for you but it would be a large number in terms of orders that we reviewed yes, terms of orders that were being reviewed by I can't estimate so it's hard for me to say what you know what large even means so well okay so it's more than 20 presumably, is there a number that you be comfortable saying it was under no because I don't even have a recollection of what the sheer scale of orders that we processed on a daily basis so for me to give you a ballpark on estimate on how many we reviewed would be that it's no I can't possibly provide you with that information okay so it could be 100 could be 500 could be 5,000 could be 50,000 you just don't have any way I don't have any way of quantifying that, do you recall ever advising that an order not ship I don't recall I do I don't this is all again 89 years ago actually further than that you're going back to 2008 I don't have a recollection of the order monitoring Port I don't have a recollection of that activity that I can share with you on the record that I'm definitive about I don't,though the night my question here is in terms of your recollection do you recall during that three-year time period that you were the product manager for Oxycodone ever advising that an order not ship and again I'm telling you that that was over 10 years ago from anywhere from 9 to 11 years ago and I don't have a firm Comfort level in terms of I don't remember but this was an important component of your job was a not it was a portion of my job in Oxy was one of the products that I made, managed so it was a component it was important but it was a smaller in terms of the scope of my job this was not everything that I did and again it was you know eight to ten years ago I really don't remember, but the oxycodone product was an important product for mallik Road I think you indicated it was a quarter of their of their sales and we did talk to that yes and so and there was there was clearly sensitivity by the DEA regarding the abuse of this product isn't that fair, was their sensitivity from the DEA yes there was clearly sensitivity by the DEA regarding the abuse of this product is that fair for me to confirm that statement I'm asking of you agree with that statement there was definitely as evidenced by the document so we went through there was a lot of focus on it by the DEA yes, and so you know this was clearly an important product for both you and Mallinckrodt it was an important product yes, and making sure that this product didn't end up or making sure that this product wasn't diverted was an important responsibility for you was it not I'm going to restate that this was eight to ten years ago that this happened you're asking me whether or not we stopped any orders or what my estimation is of the orders we evaluated I don't have a recollection, okay how much time do I have left great why don't we take a short break is 5:40 p.m. offer, so miss newly I went back and I looked at the real time and I just want to make sure that the record is clear on this you don't recall whether you did or did not ever say not to ship an order of Oxycodone is that correct, I don't know so it's possible that in your three years as a product manager for Oxycodone for Mallinckrodt you never said don't ship an order that's possible, I would say that we had a robust, Psalms suspicious order monitoring program in place that we adhere to we had a strong compliance team we all worked diligently to to make sure that we were doing the right thing as a whole I cannot speak to specifics with regards to orders and the percentage of orders that were reviewed the percentage that were held I can't speak to that, that and so I mean it it is possible then that in your three years as a product manager for Oxycodone you never said don't ship and work that's possible since I don't have a recollection that is possible and if you did say not to stop or if you did say not to ship in order that would be captured in an email wouldn't it, potentially, well when you say potentially what what do you mean by that it could be captured in the email it could have been a discussion that we had so the communication could have taken place I'm sure a number of different ways but there would be some written record of you stating or have you objecting to the shipment of an order correct again I'm just going to go back to the fact that we did have a good suspicious order monitoring program in place, that we were all working diligently to make sure that what we were shipping out the door was for you know for a good purpose I will also reiterate the product that we were shipping was going to a wholesaler and to a distributor so we were monitoring those orders and to the best of our ability we were you know adhering we were adhering to our program to flag suspicious orders what happens beyond that, you know when it got down to the to the customers customer and then you know down to then the doctor prescribing to the patient that was so far down the supply chain that that was definitely something that we wouldn't have the especially down to the doctor in the prescriber we wouldn't have the visibility into I would say that when the DEA made the statement about knowing your customers customers and you know as evidenced by the emails that you started to see more so in 2010, when we definitely were taking measures to try to figure out how to do that so from an overarching perspective I feel very confident that we were doing the right thing in terms of the orders and whether or not Waters were released whether or not orders were held documentation of that activity I can't speak to that I don't have a firm recollection of the details, so when you are a product manager you track the overall amount of Oxycodone and oxycontin and 30 that Mallinckrodt was providing to it's just it to its customers correct we created sales forecasts and budgets based on actual so yes did you ever become concerned with the volume of Oxycodone that Mallinckrodt was shipping, I wasn't necessarily concerned with the volume that we were shipping we were doing everything within our power to monitor orders and to comply with the dea's request in terms of submit suspicious order monitoring so it wasn't so much concerned with our shipment of orders because I feel like we were adhering and doing the right thing I did have questions about the market and the size of the overall market and trying to wrap my, my arms around what was happening within the oxycodone Market Downstream which was really challenging because we didn't really like I said we didn't have the visibility into that that portion I think what you saw from the emails then 2010 was us trying to understand what was happening and trying to take measures even further than what we'd already done with our suspicious order monitoring program which monitored the demand from our customers, switch was Distributors and wholesalers but I think you saw as digging and even further taking it a step further beyond what you somebody then proceeded to be on the the onus of the manufacturer to to really try to understand what was happening in the oxycodone market and so when you say you had questions about the market and the size of the overall market for Oxycodone on when did you have those questions um I would say that they we were starting you know so we we talked about, IMS and about the market data that's reported and so you could see your over your molecule growth so you can see what the total was happening with the total market and I can't remember I can't pinpoint the time when we started to look at it and a lot of it started to be honest with you because we were just trying to forecast you know we were trying to as a company trying to get a handle on what our forecast would be for this this product and we would use molecule growth rate for all products not just oxy to apply, that molecule to understand if it was growing if it was declining and then use that to you know calculate you know our market share off of to to come up with our sales budget and you know at that point in time I think the molecule growth rate was more like hey what's happening here I'm trying to project we were trying to project you know what our sales would be and the growth rate was faster than what we had forecasted and I think that that led us to start to look at things and say well why is that and, and then you know and again seeing the activity in 2010 as to when that initial like thought occurred I can't remember that and I would tell you if I could but it was definitely it was something that evolved over the course of time with us as a company in terms of understanding you know like I said we adhered to the suspicious order monitoring program that we had put in place we worked with the DEA we were doing everything, that we were supposed to be doing but this was something that it took a while to put all the pieces together on in terms of what was happening within the total market and then what was happening with our customer base and I would say it took time to finally see what the big that the whole all these pieces together what they meant and I think you see that in 2010 and I remember that's the part that I remember is in 2010 scene putting it all together starting, to see what was truly you know happening and taking action and that's that's the part that has stuck with me since I left the company I feel very strongly that we as a company did what we could and adhered to what was expected from the da the time to do the right thing with this with this molecule with with all of our all of our opioids and so when you say that you finally saw the, eager the whole pieces put together which was in 2010 what that whole picture was was that Mallinckrodt products were being diverted down stream was it not I can't and I can't speak to if Mallinckrodt its products were being diverted or not Downstream I don't know that because I don't know that there was ever a direct tie to I don't know I don't know that but what I can say is from a big picture perspective the oxy Market, had grown and it caused this to to dig into it more and whenever we did we started to identify the issues with the sales and to Florida the DEA was you know working very closely with Karen Harper and we when we finally started to put it together we realized that we shouldn't be selling to particular customers and we made that decision not to, I've I just said it's challenging for me to sit here today and I'm happy to go through all these emails with you and talk to them but it's challenging for me to see where we did anything wrong I mean we were trying to adhere to the not trying we were adhering to what the DEA requested from us and we were putting together programs you know and as you could see in the guidance that you provided to me from the DEA they didn't give specific instructions on how to how to do this you know there wasn't, they gave us high-level components on how to identify suspicious order but they never gave us like they basically left it to the manufacturers there was no one system that all manufacturers use to monitor you know suspicious order so it was up to us as a company to try to determine how to build out the system and I think what you've seen is that we worked really hard to do that and to to adhere to it so I don't know I don't know what else to say, well, based on the growth rate for Oxycodone you clearly had questions about that growth rate correct we that's what you we were we were trying to understand why the market was growing that fast yes and was one of the questions whether this groped wraith was reflective of diversion and medically inappropriate uses no I don't think that that was really in terms of when we were first seen the growth rate I don't think that that was so much on, on the radar at least for us in terms of that being that being a driver of the molecule growth rate I will say in 2010 when we started to dig into the data even more into the data and we were being asked to know our customers customer you have to understand we were just shipping into the distributor and the wholesaler and then they were internship being on to the pharmacies and so when we started digging into that that's when we started to put the pieces together but I, I well would you agree that sitting here today there is an opioid crisis in this country I think you've asked me that question already and it's on the record for my response and please refresh my memory them what is your response would you agree I said that I wasn't sure I don't know if there's truly an opioid crisis and the I don't know so you put together all the data you dig into the data in 2010 you assemble all the pieces of the puzzle but as you're sitting here you're you don't actually know whether, there is a problem with opioid abuse in the United States I've been so far removed from the situation I mean this was back open in my last my last month that Mallinckrodt was in January of 2011 and I haven't worked in the opioid industry since then what I can tell you as far as a company which is what we're here to talk about today is what Mallinckrodt did do or didn't do back in the time frame that I was there we did everything to the best of our ability to, to address two and two what's the right word for me what am I trying to say here, to to address what the da was sharing with us which at the time was sails into the State of Florida and Distributors who were selling to the State of Florida and the disproportionate amount and so we as a company did do that and we took the steps that we need to do as a company to at least control the piece that we had control over well but you weren't in the compliance Department correct I was not in the compliance Department warning the sales department I was in the marketing department Department, so you dealt with data so you don't you don't know that the DEA only talk to Mallinckrodt about the State of Florida I don't know that I think that you so much of your questioning was around the State of Florida today and that's why I specifically noted it and my conversation just now with you if we want to call this a conversation, hey but you don't you you don't know what the DEA was telling Mallinckrodt regarding opioids generally or other jurisdictions where it had concerns I can only address what I knew from my portion within marketing I saw all of our internal teams working strongly together to try you know to to make sure that I provided the right data to make sure that we were analyzing it working closely with Karen Harbor who was you know the head of compliance to ensure that, that we were meeting all you know being responsible as a company and ensuring that we were being responsible with the product that we were shipping out the door but when you say that Mallinckrodt did everything it could you're referring to your department and from a marketing and data standpoint is that it's not fair I'm speaking from a marketing perspective and I'm also speaking from what I was able to observe during my time there we had a specific suspicious order monitoring program that we adhered to Karen Harper was, legit and her team was diligent in terms of adhering to that making improvements figuring out how we could do better I witnessed that and so so as an overarching comment I would say that the company yes did everything it could to ensure responsibility within the marketplace but you have no idea how many Mallinckrodt products were diverted by Downstream customers do you owe my question is to you we, I have no way of knowing that there's absolutely no way of knowing that that's so far down the stream I mean you've got you've got doctors who are prescribing the patients and we don't know we don't know of those patients who know there's no way to know but the part that we had control over so we didn't have control over the doctors writing the prescriptions we didn't have control necessarily over the distributor selling to to pharmacies that you qualified potentially as pill Mills earlier but we did have control over, of us who we sold the product to and if we identified them as a customer who was problematic then we made that decision which obviously happened in the fall of 2010 to not sell to them so I think that we don't know what product was or wasn't diverting the market but of the piece that we had control over within the supply chain we did take the actions that we could to to be responsible in terms of distribution of our product are you aware that Mallinckrodt in, entered into a settlement agreement with the da or a memorandum of understanding not familiar with that I've not been with the company again for the past seven years so no I'm not familiar with that, okay okay so I'm done yep",0.8483896315315312,0.6161287,0.91283864

hghb0039,"hi there I'm that Leary as jimster are outlined in his letter contained with this video RJ R must reverse our full price trend in camlann select Our Best Bets to accomplish that goal this video is designed to explain to you how we're going to establish momentum on select quickly so how do we plan to do it and what makes us think it will work it takes two things and you got to have both and they are one, a better idea and to better programs camel is the best example of this one two punch I can think of Joe Camel was a better idea for a number of reasons but what really got the consumer to change their behavior where the ongoing incentives to buy camel with appealing premiums together the better idea Joe Camel and the better programs retail premiums got it done it took both so let's talk about select first we got to have it, idea something the brand can stand for we need to put something in the minds of consumers if we don't place a clear idea in their heads select will not work period okay so what must this idea do and more importantly how will we know it will work we use three criteria in its development and you should judge it in your own mind against these measures and they are is it unique is it meaningful and is it credible so what's the idea, Dia we are going to convince smokers that select is made better it's that simple so how's it made better it's made for better tobacco what's better about it it's perfectly aged what difference does that make aging is the key to smooth flavor just like fine wine or whiskey the back of Melos as it ages in a sentence select tobacco's demand perfect aging because, can't rush the flavor this is not unlike Folgers using only Mountain grown coffee beans because they make the richest tasting coffee mug lives are spent considerable time talking about their elusive be built a brand will be using three key elements to communicate with the primary one is Turtle which quickly says we took our time, second is our perfectly aged seal look for this to show up everywhere and lastly actual tobacco leaves which provide a lot of impacted interest for smokers you'll be seeing combinations of these elements in point-of-sale premium and Retail displays and it every communication love guava test is unique I can't think of another brand saying anything, like this most smokers have never even seen tobacco the me that represents an opportunity to make an impression in people's mind one that will stick is it meaningful we believe it strikes at the heart of value and people are more interested today and getting their money's worth than ever before and lastly is it credible from the start smoking tip always say collect sounds like make better why else would we have called it select so hopefully you'll agree, have an idea that can work but that's only half the battle they have the better idea of where the better program so the better program involves really engaging smokers and asking for the sale and involves something called personal selling it goes beyond hanging some point of sale running some ads and sitting back and waiting for it to work that strategy will not work anymore smokers just aren't that interested, we've got to turn up the heat with every encounter we've got to say hey I've got something important to say here stand here take a minute and pay attention we're explaining the select story to Consumers and then asking for a commitment at NASCAR races were not just saying here's a pack of Winston enjoy the race we're taking the time to give consumers a clear reason to switch to select one last point on this think about the reasons we've all heard people give as to why they smoke the brand they do we can list them on one hand, and I like the taste I always have my friends smoke it net net they don't have a lot of compelling reasons that's another opportunity we can provide them reasons to smoke select starting with all cigarettes are not created equal the tobacco makes a difference that makes sense to people you'll see this new approach in all of our programs so before I turn it over to Rick Sanders who will explain personal selling and more detail I'd like to say we think we have something here that can work, I believe we have a better idea and that our programs to bring that idea to life it won't happen overnight it will be a slow building process but if we stick with it and remain true to the idea I'm convinced we can make select work I hope you agree I'm Rick Sanders vice president of Cal marketing Services You Know Field sales is always had a promotional offer to give to competitive smokers that we meet at retail but if you're like me, you've always wondered if your consumer Mission efforts really made a difference and resulted in the switch well as never Larry told us a moment ago a good trial offer by itself just isn't as effective as they used to be converting dull competitive smokers it takes more and that's when personal cell phones in personal selling uses three critical steps rather than the one step of just making consumers at off first, you provide adult smokers with a real geek meaningful and credible reason to switch to our plan just like the product reasons net talk about uh select second as we've always done give them the opportunity to try our products right on the spot with an offer that's hard to turn down an offer such as our consumer Mission over, and third you invite them to join a program that provides intensive follow-up for initial contact getting these smokers into these follow-up programs means that your initial contact will be reinforced with that smoker over and over again by using all three of these steps in your personal selling efforts and making a big difference a big difference in smokers interest in our products and a big difference in smokers acceptance of, and that translates directly to share for Our Brands and increase claims the company now you may say well that sounds good but can I really make a difference well let me tell you in the average convenience store for competitive smokers have Pace wasteful Winston select the provide Winston one full SharePoint increase in essence more smokers one here, I think what personal selling that's very cool just think of how many smokers BC and I call each month and you can begin to realize what a powerful personal selling to be it allows you to do what you do best the cell are gr products to competitive smoker to retailers and the family and friends will provide you with the tools to make personal selling easy, and make it fun now one more thing before you begin this is three steps of personal selling with any smolder it's very important to follow 1ge guideline only approach smokers were 21 years of age or older if they look to be under the age of 30 make sure verbally verified at least 21 years old so as you've seen personal selling is a new, that can be used for all of our Brands but it can be particularly effective on our full price investment G camel and Winston select the demonstrations you're about to see will only address Winston select but as was mentioned earlier will be sending you a video on Camel in the coming months, now let's take a look first of all selling hi I'm Brian Stockdale senior Marketing Manager on the Winston camel business unit I know you're probably asking yourself how do I do this and still complete the rest of my responsibilities well first let me tell you the personal selling is an opportunistic program that has proven to work after 16 years with RJ are 11 and sales and five and marketing I know the issues you're going to face on personal selling, and it's not going to be easy and it won't work for every smoker don't get frustrated by Rejection it happens to all of us over 60 of us been practicing for about three months now and I've identified four key things that work best and make a difference in your approach they are number one never lead with have you tried it often leads to immediate rejection number to start with friends cashiers people you know to become, more comfortable with the message number three know the story about select so you don't end up reading from brochure number four be confident comfortable and committed to making a difference there are also five key things that are important to smokers they are different tobacco is what makes cigarettes taste different and we're to Winston select tobacco is aged to Perfection like fine wine or whiskey number 3 our, vasile wrap protects the perfect wedge tobacco and it's moisture content number four select proofs are worth twice as much in our continuity program and finally NASCAR racing sponsorship among racing enthusiasts now let's go in the store and see how personal selling can make a difference to our business hi I'd like a pack of Virginia Slims, you miss your smoker I sure am my name is Brian Stockdale I work for RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company I'd like to ask you a couple of questions real quick if I could write your name Mary Jones nice to meet you marry my pleasure your birthday January 1st 1963 very good real quick what do you think makes cigarette brands taste different, different tobacco that's absolutely right and what do you think makes a great wine or a good whiskey, different ingredients and aging I guess people take their time I'd like to talk to you about a brand that you're not currently smoking called Winston select slim lights I tried Winston's before I don't like them this is a new Winston select product different from our current Winston products and just like fine wine and whiskey we have perfectly aged product that we take our time with what I'd like you to do is put back your pack of Virginia slim lights and I'll buy you a second pack to go along with it and you'll leave with two packs of the price of one what do you think, sounds great okay if you put her pack back for give her two packs of Select lights a couple other things real quick I'd like to show you all right most products have cellophane we put what's called a flavor seal wrap on our product so once we go through the trouble of using perfectly aged tobacco's and put the flavor seal wrap on it what that does is you can bend the select product almost into a you before it ever snaps in half wow so now I do we perfect wedge the tobacco, for a mellow smooth taste but the flavor seal keeps all the moisture in but you're telling me I can definitely notice and if you will notice a huge difference Mary and I'm sure I'm convinced you'll switch in fact I'm so convinced what I'd like you to do I promise real quick this brochure will walk you through what I just took you through how we perfectly aged it tobacco's how we compare to Fine Wine and whiskey and you can't rush the flavor there is a BRC card in here that I'd like you to take one second to fill out what I'll do for you sir, and you two more free packs in the mail because I'm convinced you're going to like the product and ask for your opinion in addition to that you'll get more coupons and more product in the mail from us can you give me just a second fill that out for more free offers

development Alex Holtzman vice president general counsel, Jim Thompson vice president of media, and from the Marketing Group one person who's played a very important role in preparing this presentation Renee Simon's Executive Vice President I'm sorry assistant to the Executive Vice President of Mark if there were theme for today's meeting it would be progress, consistent and persistent both now and in the future, today we are America's leading cigarette Market here are task for the future is to strengthen and build on that position and to widen our lead, the success of that task depends on the quality of our products, our advertising and promotion are Salesforce and Merchandising, and our strategic management, last year Philip Morris USA demonstrated its aggressiveness resiliency and determination to keep growing and an increasing challenging environment, in 1985 operating revenues reach six point six billion dollars increasing 477 million dollars or seven point eight percent for the year pre-tax income was over two billion dollars up 17.4% from 1984 net income increase to one point 1 billion dollars up 17.6, percent after tax return on assets reached 36 percent and USA's pre-tax cash flow increased to 2 billion dollars reflecting a 12.1 percent increase over last year, in the next hour you will get an overview of the Sig upmarket as it is today, I report on the progress off and the prospects for our leading brands, a report on some exciting developments in merchandising and field sales, and a summary of our achievements and our future challenges and opportunities and now I will turn the meeting over to Bill Campbell our Executive Vice President of Market Bill thank you Frank progress is defined by Webster as forward or onward movement although this meaning suits our purpose will be primarily chose that as our theme for its Dynamic nature in today's marketing environment progress in the city, Arete business isn't decided by merely momentum or size although we have achieved sales share and profit leadership we remain dedicated to improving both our strategic and tactical marketing the strengthening our Market position on a macro level 1985 was largely a successful year profits continued their Superior growth while unit sales and Market sheer grew in a shrinking work, place however sales and share growth did not reach historical levels in 1985 and therefore we must look critically at our results in detail this examination reveals some areas where we successfully met our objectives somewhere we are stabilizing our position somewhere we missed the mark and somewhere the jury is still out, I will highlight these four areas and elaborate on them later in the hour our complete successes for 1985 where borrow and Virginia Slims both Brands achieve new high unit sales and market share and both grants benefited from incremental contributions by line extension closely examining a second area we are working to stabilize the weaknesses in Merit and Benson & Hedges we have two objectives, both prayers to rigorous analysis and are implementing new marketing programs, to further stabilize our overall business we are building competitive positions in the growing press found the segment and in sales and Merchandising we are committed to being a major factor in these two areas, we entered the price value category last year that the test marketing is subsequent National Rollout of players likes 25 we are also entering in direct competition with generics and drought using our Keepers trademark, turning to sales and Merchandising p.m. USA has made a long-term commitment to retail leadership in the cigarette business three of the most urgent issues facing POS HR in the next five years are addressing the imbalance but PM's market share and share of inventory securing adequate seal space and reducing Auto stocks, we have recently expanded and reorganize our sales force and built up our in-store merchandising with new cigarette Carton and package fixtures and related retail PACE program, well we've had some significant successes we continue to substantially lay or Jr in retail dominance our challenge for the future the third area for close examination is the Menthol business where we continue to fall short of our goal the unsatisfactory 17 percent share of the Menthol segment has been a perennial problem for p.m. USA we have been not we have not been able to successfully launch, competitive non line extension menthol, the last area is the area where results are not final the jury is still out but two brains they only test markets Concord and Dunham Concord is a unique cigarette that allows the smoker to dial a star and flavor level downhill is an upscale entry with International Heritage both going forward and Dunhill are showing pockets of strength and weakness currently we're adjusting our marketing strategies in light of the Brand's, formance is in consumer research and I will talk about that further length above these and other new products towards the end of this presentation at this time I'd like to introduce John solar director of marketing research who will review the current market trends John will be followed by Hopper over and Ellen Merlot our group directors of brand management John thanks Bill and good morning, today I will be reviewing the most important Marketplace developments and sales trends for the industry and Philip Morris, first let's briefly examine the industry's performance in the final months of 1985 shipments were erratic due to the uncertainty surrounding the sun setting of the 60s a pack that are like excise tax this situation was temporarily resolved in late December with the tax was extended to March 15 1986 at about the same time the industry instituted a price increase, the counter balancing effect of these two events when a small additional trade inventory accumulation nevertheless total shipments fell five billion units to 595 billion 1985 this was a loss of point eight percent, analyzing the industry's Dynamics while the adult population has been growing by 1.1 percent annually smoking incidents and consumption for day continue to decrease slightly the overall impact is a reduction in retail sales, consumer sales is measured by Nielsen for down about one percent from last year's level and this rate of decline is expected to continue in the near term, now we'll take a look at Philip Morris, in 1985 p.m. sales today record two hundred thirteen point six billion have 2 billion units over 1984, Philip Morris USA stay consistent progress over the years is best seen in comparison to competition are 1985 sales volume increase of 2 billion units contrast with the loss of seven billion incurred by all the other companies combined in the past five years we have grown 22 billion units while competition is Fallen forty four billion, how did each company do last year, 1985 r.j. Reynolds had a 31.9 market share which was a point three improvement over the previous year Reynolds sheer growth was entirely due to derail which has become the lowest price cigarette on the market in fact without Durrell RJ r-- would have experience to share loss, during the past several years Rebels has been trading high-margin volume for low-margin V since 1983 it's price value brands have grown 8 billion units while it's full price entries to Fallen 6 billion, this full price loss has occurred despite spending an estimated 425 million on couponing merchandising and sales promotion activities, for the first time in four years Brown & Williamson enjoy the sheer game it's 11.8 market share was a hash year Point Advance over 1984 BMW is value entries including their generic private label line and Richland 25 were responsible for this year increase, however every full price BMW brand suffered losses since 1983 the BMW price value in trees grow 11 billion but it's full price Brands drop 10 billion units, liggett's drop from 5.7 markets here in 1984 24.9 this year it's older brands are still losing ground and lick its generics feeling new competitive pressure fell from a 4.0 23.4 shear, Laura's 8.0 sheer was slightly under its 1984 level while Newport remains a strong performer its gains were unable to compensate for the losses of Kansas and the rest of the lorillard lineup, American followed the downward Trend it's been on for over 20 years and slid Point porch with 7.5 share of oh Carlton was unchanged the other American brands declined, in 1985 Philip Morris USA extended its trend of annual market share increases p.m. a record share of 35.9, the point six-yard gain was the largest of any cigarette company while our sheer growth is lower than in recent years it's still notable as it was accomplished without substantial participation in the low price low margin segment, now I'd like to recap 1980 fives most significant Marketplace developments, the lote ours was the 49 Shear showed virtually no growth in the full flavors with a 45 sheer have also leveled, the only look to our Branch to show any upward movement for the price value packings and our own Marlboro Lights, the ultra low tar is have stabilized a ten percent of the total Market, of the 20 leading brands in 1985 only five display Vitality Margaret continue to improve its number one position with a point nine markets your game Newport remain robust and had a point force your Advanced Virginia Slims had a point to share game among the lower price Brands both Doral BMWs generics it's your gains of .87 to the brand leaders were basically flat plus or minus 1/10 of a Shear point, the remaining Brands were down between point two and point seven share led by lick its generic decline, as has been true for some time the success rates of new freestanding cigarette brands is extremely low in 1984 and 1985 11 new brands were introduced to the test Market three of these all price value entries went National many of the others have already been withdrawn from the market and none of those remaining in test markets currently justifies a National Rollout, indeed among the 12 new brands nationally long since 1980 16 have current market shares greater than half a point with one exception every one of these Brands is the price value entry the sole exception Berkeley has been declining since its introduction, the foremost Marketplace developments of 1985 and the past several years has been the vigorous expansion of the price value s this category consists of the lowest price generic brands including No-Frills Brands and storefronts for several years Liggett was the only major supplier such products, in mid 1984 Ronald Williamson launched a competing line of generics and archaea Rebels reposition Darrell as a generic entry, by December 1985 severe competition caused the generic price Brands to sell for two dollars and seventy cents less per Carton and full-price ones collectively they had a 6.0 market share which was a gain of one point to share points derail their cells about 50% of its volume with money off coupons has been showing the most growth, the second major price value components is the value 25s these brands are for consumers interested in brand name quality as well as cost savings rentals introduced century and mid-1983 that was followed by Branagh Williamson's Richland in June 1985 and by Philip Morris's players lights 25 in December the value 25 is achieved a 1.3 market share, in some 1985 the entire price value category including the generic price and the value 25 centuries reached a market share of 7.3 up 1.7 share points although this segment size and growth are impressive profitability is low the 16 dollar and fifty cent per thousand profit margins for the full price brands for Exceed the estimated 150 2270 margins of the generics, however the value 25 do have respectable margins between 750 and 1125, the growth of the price value segments is taking its toll on the full price brands from 1982 to 1985 price value brand volume Rose from 6 billion to forty three billion units, at the same time the full price Brands declined nearly 65 billion to 552 billions, thus it is extremely difficult for any full price brand to show growth, a cigarette companies performance traditionally has been measured on market share over the greater importance of the price value segment along with its lower profitability other performance criteria must be examined each companies 1985 market share has already been discussed, this differs from each company share of the full price segments notice that while Philip Morris has a 35.9 market share it has a 38.5 share of the full price segment at The Other Extreme legis has a four point nine markets year but only a 1.5 will price share, marketing expenditure strategies as well as multiple price levels can dramatically affect business comparisons if we look in detail at only the to eating cigarette companies Philip Morris has 53 percent of the combined unit sales versus Reynolds 47 are 54 percent of the combined revenues reflects the fact that Reynolds has more low price business, a major reversal occurs when we look at marketing expenditures r.j. Reynolds substantially had spent Philip Morris and Merchandising and coupon consequently p.m. accounts for only forty four percent of marketing expenditures, in terms of operating income the spread between ourselves and rentals widens as a result of favorable price mix and lower marketing expenditures pwsa enjoys 62% of the two companies combined in here, of course one of the primary reasons for the difference of the various performance measures between ourselves and rentals is moreover that Robert Roper root brand director will highlight the Brand's 1985 activities and accomplishments, second job bulbar oh Philip Morris USA Flagship brand continued its strong growth and expanded its industry dominance 1985 the brand Group by 4.3 billion units to a hundred and thirty-three point three billion units and increase of 3.4% this increased its market share by nearly a full SharePoint to 22.4 while the whole flavor pack has provided the foundation for the brand it was, mobilized to continue to provide spectacular growth, bulbar red unit sales were virtually flat its 71 million units and mole Borough 100's posted a slight loss of 260 million units however because of the industry declined their combined share was on almost a tenth of a SharePoint, at the same time the vulgar or whites packings were up dramatically by 4.6 billion units or 11.9% of market share prove 810 sharepoint's 27.4 this performance makes it by far the largest selling low tar brand, a the largest selling brand in the industry continued to widen his lead over its nearest competitors but it's the continued strength and vitality all the components of whole Borough that both so well future of the brand mower is leading brand in each of the categories in which it competes both later hundreds and low tar beyond that Mulder is the largest selling brand among men among women and among Hispanic smokers, and if share continues to grow each of these categories, in addition mole per share is increasing and every age group the brand is increased the share dramatically among smokers and the 18 to 24 segment to 47 percent but it's improving share an older smokers means that the brand is keeping us with smokers as they age this trend these Trends are predictors of continued growth of the franchise, Moltres extraordinary growth of the years is no accident it has been firmly founded sound advertising Innovative promotions in line extension is to continue to provide consumers with reasons to try them all over, let's look at how each of these elements has worked in combination, Carl an extension strategy has been clear to expand brand growing segments of the market building upon and adding to the strength of the total offer a family in 1967 was longer than cigarettes with Marlboro 100's 1971 was low tar with small Barrel lights, arm over 25% reduction in January 1985 was based on the same successful line extension strategy our advertising 425 was consistent with them over image but was designed to have stopping power in keeping with our heritage of offering only the highest quality products vulvar 25 position to some convenience not an economy offer consumers were charging 25% more than five extra cigarettes, the results of over 25 introduction follow our previous leg extension experience the brand generated 3.8 billion units per sales and Achieve six-tenths of a SharePoint First full year of its introduction, to ensure that more of our 25 realize its full potential increasing retail distribution and inventory our top priorities for this year, I want extension activity on Marlborough helps the bread maintain its Competitive Edge but it's the consistency of our advertising that reassures consumers the image of the brand flavor promise of the franchise remained unchanged regardless of the packings we introduced, we continue to be single-minded in our advertising constantly reinforcing the flavor Heritage of the brand and providing substantial support for both our full flavor and our lights patterns in 1985 we ran several multiple page units for specials intended to break through the advertising clutter allowing smokers to spend a little more time Marlboro Country, however in today's competitive environment high impact advertising alone you're not staying over a strong performance retail promotions play an increasingly important role in attracting new smokers tomorrow as well as combating the discount strategy of our competition, Moe Berg continued its valuated approach by offering consumers a variety of incentives free with lot of to pack for car purchase, our Red Roof lighter continues to remain one of our most popular promotional items we believe court incentives like the mole vertex and poker card set the moldboard or poster which combined value and image of the best way to reward our current franchise remote trial and build our business long term, this year Marlboro will take will be taking aggressive steps to ensure edited position at retail next month Pulver will be offering consumers and take the set the best of our country music free with purchase 25,000 retail Adams, March and April sales force will be conducting special retail coverage will involve our oh the primary goal of improving retail visibility availability also in April vulnerable offering corduroy Sports Academy free with Carter purchase this part of the whole bar sports gear promotion, the combined impact all this activity should give bulbar of very competitive position early in the year, like retail promotions that promotions have grown in importance from all Borough event promotions reach out of our traditional retail environment and allow us the opportunity to distribute free samples and brand merchandise we also sponsor events that are unique and Innovative I'd like to give you a sense of has dramatically we've expanded not only the breath the quality of our promotions, the mole per cup was our first promotional event in 1973 today it is one of the most respected thoroughbred horse races in America in 1976 we added our Resort coverage with sampling and giveaways in a few for spring vacation spots it is evolved a year-round program conducted in over 50 Marcus, 1981 we participated in our first Hispanic Festival today we conduct festivals and 15 major markets accounting for nearly 70 percent of the Spanish population 1983 the mall burski challenge is operating on a test basis and Colorado only today is program is available at 15 of the most prestigious ski resorts in the country and since 1984 mole per country music is come to be recognized as the finest concert, music industry tracking such stars as Barbara Mandrell Alabama Merle Haggard, in the early 80s we begin to actively support run we run free auto racing events here in the US last year we significantly increased our involvement auto racing with an extensive sign and tracks lightish program along the sampling and Merchandising activities and cart IndyCar racing events in addition we sign up for the top drivers on the circuit to the mall world world championship team, they start program success last year vulnerable sponsored and Holbrook Patrick racing team featuring driver Emerson fittipaldi this year the sponsorship will make mole predominant Factor US Auto Racing well we're has been and continues to be a singular marketing success significant challenges remain we must continue to provide consumers with complete line of product alternatives to aggressive carefully thought-out line extensions, the same time you must preserve to create an image that has been so effective over the years while ensuring that Marlboro brand remains contemporary and finally this molar becomes one of every four cigarettes sold in the US we must maintain adequate inventory visibility at retail to ensure that the brass natural growth is not restricted in any way now I'll turn the presentation over to Ellen Barlow group director brand management thank you Bob and good morning, Virginia Slims has been a consistent winner in 1985 was no exception Slim's was one of only three brands in the entire industry to show significant growth volume increased by almost 2 billion units to sixteen point seven billion and shared group to tens of a SharePoint to an all-time high of 2.8 well full-flavored Slim's declined by 480 million units lights gain, 260 million units but as you can see why it's growth wasn't sufficient to offset the declines of the pair of packets they are for the highly successful introduction of Virginia Slims 120s in October which contributed 1.2 billion units to the franchise provided the impetus to give the brand its net gain of 6.1% Virginia Slims 120s will launch nationally with one of the most comprehensive advertise, using and Retail programs ever designed to encourage trial in conversion highlights of the introductory program included to form offers incentive items a special five pack offer especially designed for carton Outlets are free pack will offer and a special playing card offer year-end Virginia Slims 120s will contributing a net of four-tenths of a SharePoint to the franchise, in 1985 we supported the brand and compelling contemporary advertising in 1986 that advertising continues with graphic emphasis on the modern Virginia Slims woman our ethnic Market advertising will utilize dramatic photographs and graphic devices to emphasize or Menthol packings this approach will also be translated to point-of-sale Outdoor Advertising will be more impactful in both General and ethnic group, true 1985 we once again filled with the annual Virginia Slims book of days heart and Center one of the most successful promotions in the industry in 1986 our promotional activity will be even more aggressive at this year's court has said it will be the Virginia Slims sliver stack while the 1987 book of days will be utilized as a 3-pack incentive both items will encourage competitive trial in conversion, in addition will inaugurate the Virginia Slims Sweatshop a four-page a a which will feature specially designed clothing and Leisure Time gear on a self-liquidating basis in the area of the event promotions the Virginia Slims championships series Remains the Brand's Premier promotion 1985 do is record crowds at all events to enhance our tennis sponsorship in 1986 we will be offering or retail consumers to pack incentive, you've come a long way baby shoelaces the Virginia Slims American woman's opinion poll a national survey conducted by the Roku organization which investigated both women's and men's attitudes in the areas of family marriage career and child-rearing generated impressive National publicity in 1985 Virginia Slims tested its fashion Fun Fair shopping mall promotion and three cities in 1986 this promotion will be, headed to ten cities the show which brings the Virginia Slims imagery alive to over two million Shoppers provides us the opportunity to sample between a half and three quarters of the million female smokers in 1986 we will continue in product development current projects include advertising and packaging their Explorations for an Ultra Lights also on consideration or a brown or beige graph cigarette as well as the light, product utilizing Innovative Packaging, finally in 1985 Virginia slim successfully tested the Virginia Slims money coupon in 1986 we will utilize the point-of-sale execution nationally Virginia Slims money good for $2.00 per carton of our new 120s will be featured in March Virginia Slims has been successful in part because of the strong imagery we created for the product and the many opportunities we create the smokers to relate to that unique imagery, our future plans will pull the continuing the momentum to keep the Slim's growth Trend heading up word Bob let's turned out a Benson and hedges in 1985 Benson and hedges sold twenty seven point three billion units the decline of 1.6 billion units its overall share 4.6 was down two tenths of a SharePoint from 1984, looking at volume and detail being tasteful flavor decline 7.6% in the white Speckles were off as well down 6.1% the Benson and hedges Deluxe Ultra Lights group were test percent Messner has been a Troublesome brand declining past three years our objectives for lesson and hedges are clear the short term we want to stabilize sales and share longer term Returns the brand growth we have approached the task, ask improving the branch performance on three levels advertising tactical consumer promotion through strategic line extensions first we recognize that our old advertising the deluxe 100 lacked broad-based appeal therefore we developed a new campaign that features differences of opinion but focuses on the one thing everyone can agree on the taste of Benson & Hedges America's favorite 100, this campaign broadens the appeal and contains much of the humour and warmth reminiscent of the original Benson & Hedges advertised Benson & Hedges has also been negatively affected by declining trial competitive pressure from value friends therefore we have taken a number of technical steps in our consumer promotions to attract new smokers and retain current consumers, we recently met sampled over 6 million smokers with 720 packs each containing a coupon good for three dollars off the purchase of a carton of Benson and hedges we believe it's an Lincoln cart trial Marketo converted new smokers to the franchise to make our advertising work harder we're developing a number of themes promotions designed to generate greater consumer involvement drive this Valentine's Day had also includes a Cartier Diamond sweepstakes and a two-dollar ho, coupon offer three incentives with cart purchase like the Benson & Hedges cookbook with recipes from America's favorite resource reward current smokers attraction duties, Benson & Hedges primarily on the strength of its metal packings continue to be a significant brand among black smokers the brand accounts for nearly nine percent of these smokers and is important to complement our advertising with court rested promotional activity last summer we implemented a major retail program and ethnic markets featuring in-store promotions signage broad based sampling and Festival activities, furthermore we're putting the finishing touches on a black music concert series which will feature prominent black excellent Pointer Sisters, pH is also a leader among the growing Hispanic segment was the seven share we continue to increase both media and promotional support for this important smoker group, however our greatest strategic challenge will be to capture a greater share of the growing hundred mm look at our second last year we spent considerable time evaluate the Dynamics of the franchise analyzing the branch Sheriff category by packing you can see the vnh full flavor of choice of 16 sure of its segment and the deluxe Ultra Lights packings have a 19 share of this category, the whites packs are significantly underdeveloped withholding a chair therefore we are concentrating our efforts on revitalizing the lights portion of the franchise to that end began test marketing events in hedge Deluxe lights lighting specialist past October the line extension uses upscale packaging as we did with Deluxe Ultra Lights to provide news value for the brain test results today indicate the brand has a 7/10 smokers here we are, are currently refining the advertising to optimize our product positioning expect to be National later this year, we have invested in Hedges of powerful brand franchise top-quality called Product upscale image High consumer recognition challenge you 1986 we do letters these attributes to return the ranch of growth through the successful implementation of our brand plans now I'd like to spend a minute talking about Parliament search of these two Brands don't get a great deal of attention but nevertheless and headed for over seven and a half million units of sales, in contributed 108 million dollars in margin Parliament despite an absence of advertising and promotion support for most of the Year generated 5.8 billion units sales declined 300 million units sharing made basically flat one percent in our efforts to reverse this decline we developed a campaign which features the primary product benefit the recessed filter but also establishes an image for the smoker profile, campaign began running and September and received concentrated media support parliament's top 15 markets which account of rotor two-thirds of parliament sales in 1986 the brand we further supported by an aggressive Regional retail merchandising program, sir our total sales of 1.8 billion units in 1985 represents a decline of nearly 200 million units with share remaining basically stable 3/10 of a share we do this performances encouraging insert toga has been with that an advertising campaign we have just completed new created for the brand which we believe can broaden the appeal and attract smokers of competing hundred millimeter and 120 mm load car brands in addition or, apparently redesigning the serotonin the packaging to give it a more contemporary look once this is complete we'll be in a position to resume supporting the brand Mary came to the market is a revolutionary product the result of a breakthrough and cigarette design manufacturing and marketing the brand established a strong franchise but lately has been in a period of decline as the lotar category hit a plateau while total verifying declined by one point, billion units to twenty four point two billion and total share Define two tenths of a SharePoint 24.1 85 there was evidence that last year's launch of marik's Kings box help to stabilize the overall losses of the parent Pac specifically the parents off Tak was 1.9 billion units while Fox contributed 1.6 billion units, Merritt ultralights in the face of declining ultra low category continue to grow the overall decline in marriage sales can largely be attributed to two factors the decline of the full priced low tar category and the growth of generic evaluate trees We Believe however that in the short term we will be able to stabilize sales long-term strategies to bring about chair revitalization, we have already developed programs to encourage trial to stimulate sales and Courtney outlets and to create imagery that offers a smoker benefit and provides a strong promotional platform let's first look at advertising in 1983 we launched the sea campaign subsequent research told us the imagery generated by that advertisement did not appeal to our target audience the ultralights execution of the campaign however was found to be much more, as a result while keeping the sees the venue we created new advertising that is motivational aspirational and provides the image we needed to support strong emotional Concepts utilizing a traffic rap attractive Graphics that feature men and women enjoying this sailing experience we invite the consumer to get a taste of it Merrick the low to our flavor break the campaign test extremely well among both men, right and competitive smokers the new campaign will support both parent and ultralights this new advertising will be launched in February with a dramatic three-page am in mid 85 Mary introduced a number of tactical programs to generate new smoker trial and be more responsive to competitive couponing and evaluate Series in November Merit manage quarter quell sweepstakes in which every engine received a free pack of Merit upon depositing ask, sweepstakes entry and his favorite retail outlet initial we should have results show that this was an effective trial in juicing vehicle in March we'll invite consumers to get a taste of it but you don't always or on the next part purchase the coupon will appear in National magazines and will be retail redeemed we expect it will generate significant part of movement in core tablets where mirrored has been particularly vulnerable, in the area of consumer promotions the see provided us with the backdrop in 1985 to run our successful sunglasses free with the 2-pack purchase and duffel bag with a card purchase we also offered the veritable light or through magazines on a self-liquidating basis this March Miracle offer and some sailcloth wallet three with the 3-pack purchase we will follow up in June with a cart and offer of 6, FC coasters and in the fourth quarter of 1986 we will feature the self-liquidating Slicker it, in 1985 Merit horrible lights are fireworks spectacular provided the brand quality sampling opportunity in Seven Cities and accounted for the distribution of over 40 of a million samples it also produced impressive national and local publicity results in 1986 this program will be extended to include nine cities while improved advertising and tactical programs the stabilize the Brand's existing position, they alone cannot be expected to provide a meaningful turnaround in Mirror chair Trends to accomplish our goals were looking at a number of strategies in the area of product development first we are ready Barrett 100's box will launch this entry takes advantage of the growth in both of hundreds and box segments and can be expected to attract competitive female smokers with first-year volume is henschel at least two billion units, the Strategic repositioning of Merit ultralights is another possibility for new brand volume with a product concept of all the taste of leading lotar brands with only one hand to 1/3 guitar we believe more smokers would move to meredosia Lights by utilizing updated yet to just you know Merit advertising there's a solid Market opportunity for a new marital July's four milligrams of charm, high technology May well provide strong parentage for our latest Rd break through the adjustable flavor cigarette because line extensions have recently proven more successful than new freestanding entries Merit selection is being considered as a conquered test market alternative looking further ahead merits technological history is also a natural fit for a low side screen or ambient smoke cigarette married LS or low smoke, environmental or secondhand smoke concerns head-on by creating news for the franchise with a strategic new product entry and Fielding solid advertising and business building programs we are confident we can meet our goal or first stabilizing and then once again growing this vital franchise and now to review our sales progress been useful item Vice President of Sales thank you Ella the ongoing charge for the sales order, sensation is to attain a retail presence which reflects our market share leadership today I want to review our progress towards that goal and discuss this year's objectives and how we intend to achieve them we made a commitment to years ago today Philip Morris USA America's dominance cigarette marketer at retail at the same time we recognize the need to improve our Shelf presence and depth of inventory our objective was to improve the long-standing seven percent efficiency between our share of Market, in the toilet correcting these deficiencies was the basis of our 1985 strategy and that strategy had five major elements first competitive and pre-emptive Merchandising payment programs to significantly increase car compact space for Our Brands second aggressive programs to make Philip Morris USA the preeminent fixture supplier a position held by RJ are rentals for more than 30 years third continuing in store, ER of Creative Promotions and point-of-sale materials that build consumer interest fourth intrusive signage and displays to promote a brand awareness and support new brand introductions finally an intensive sales effort aimed at high volume accounts promoting the profitability of cigarettes and establishing Philip Morris as the ultimate cigarette merchandising Authority one of the primary tools where the implementation of these strategies is plan a our cart and Merchandising incentive program, in place and eighty percent of all high volume apis those selling 300 or more cartons of cigarettes a week to improve our presence and the remaining 20% and to increase our share of space an existing plan a accounts on October 1st the aggressively restructured to plan a program we can now provide retailers with a clear incentive to stock enough p.m. product to meet consumer demand RJR can no longer control our destiny on their fixtures and are pre-emptive payments, Archer has caused our smaller competitors to re-examine their needs breathing space for PM G is new plan working we think so in the four months since October we sign 160,000 new Rows 3 times our accomplishments in the previous 15 months the new plan has created eight hundred thousand additional cartons of display retail inventory thus since 1983 we have increased our Shelf Presence by over 20%, however our historical disadvantage couples with our growth objectives require that we continue to carve out additional shelf space at the current address of rate the sales organization has also made significant strides and establishing p.m. as a realistic alternative to RJ r as the industry's fixture Supply we have developed a new generation of customized modular coordinate paragraphs winning awards for merchandising Excellence the Salesforce has been, securing cartoon picture placements by concentrating on high volume chains at the end of 1985 our sales representatives installed over 1,600 car tracks in these larger Outlets are successful re emphasis on cart merchandising during 1985 has 4 star J are into a costly response under his new plan or Jr.'s in-store investment could increase more than 40 million dollars just to maintain existing fixture placements, the increasing retail price of cigarettes as also generated new interest in single pack merchandising rapid growth in such traditional pack Outlets as convenience stores along with renewed emphasis on Pax sales and supermarkets have created new opportunities for p.m. through our page counter display program Plan B Philip Morris has gained a presence in 84,000 retail package outputs more than any other competitor, with a new horizontal display you know we were able to secure proof position and I watch chain outlets and continue the intended upgrade to larger displays you have also gained new placements in overhead pack merchandisers which are effective where counter space is at a premium we placed over 21,000 of these racks by the end of 1985 and in so doing significantly improve the in-store impact of grand POS long-standing are, har dominance of Supermarket Check Line tracks has limited p.m. brand availability and inventory death new pack Hardware permitted us to offer centralized pack merchandising and high-volume Self Service outlets in 1985 over 4,000 racks replaced increasing both the depth of inventory and product visibility through the pay display space atop each of the wrecks, our new merchandising programs and fixturing placements have had a noticeable impact on the availability of our brands of retail most notable is the significant Improvement in Marlboro inventory levels in food stores where we have achieved a 22 percent increase over the last 12 months however our objective is to reach Winston's 14-day duration point-of-sale materials providing essential visual bridge between product advertising and the consumer by year-end, 85 almost 750 thousand pieces of carbon and materials were in place in over two-thirds of all Outlets selling cigarettes in addition we placed over 6 million temporary visas we estimate that this concentration of point-of-sale averages 4.4 product and pressures for store some of our achievements in 1985 we improved our in-store position with a series of innovative and persuasive merchandising programs and materials, we made our merchandising and set of plans more attractive especially for high volume car talents you became a major supplier and innovator of cart fixtures we strengthened our already substantial position impact merchandise increase our concentration and distribution of point-of-sale materials and you continue to carry the cigarette profitability message to retailers today we're in the third year of our plan to make Philip Morris USA the number, cigarette company every detail during 1986 we will provide even more reasons for retailers to sell cigarettes and better still the forest service and to continue our progress we have developed some new merchandising programs for implementation this year to support our entries into the price value Arena we will establish cigarette saving centers in high-volume cart apples a newly designed Maxi 8-foot overhead pack merchandiser is ready with space, or 25% or brand package a new generation of permanent counter package merchandiser will be placed to improve visibility and increase inventory F by 50% and we will continue customizing POS materials or large retail chains to increase Philip Morris visibility will continue building and improving the productivity of our sales organization by adding 200 people to allow the sales force to make nearly 1 million additional calls, he's a year and support our growing Hardware commitment redeploying are expanded Workforce and targeting large volume accounts with greater call frequency and more competitive programs developing a national network of POS distribution centers to facilitate the flow of materials to our sales organization maximizing the use of many a maxi man's to reduce sales rep downtime at local Supply depots, and expanding the use of portable computers to help managers simplify reporting and Taylor profit presentations for customers let me conclude by restating that Philip Morris USA USA has made a long-term commitment to assuming retail leadership in the cigarette business and that the realization of this commitment is essential to our continued growth we're on schedule to reach our goals and I look forward to reporting or progress to build, Thanksgiving I mentioned at the outset that size and momentum can only go so far in achieving sales share and profit progress in the cigarette business that was true in 1984 85 another year of major changes in the industry a multiple Price Market became firmly established 25 became a bona fide product category with both convenience and value option consumers readily accepted 120, we tested her made firm plans to test new cigarette Technologies new packaging materials and Concepts the nation's chain supermarkets convenience stores and mass merchandisers increased in importance as Battlegrounds of cigarette Powers with RJ are being truly challenge for the first time when we went in to 1885 much of this new cigarette business was unknown well we came out of, 85 stronger more flexible and more resilient than ever we need to be even better prepare for 1986 we went into 1985 with four of the strongest brand franchises in the business are continuing priority is to keep these Brands healthy with Superior product quality advertising retail and consumer promotions if our past performance is any indication these Brands will be the mainstay, day of most of p.m. USA sales and much of our growth in coming years we know that to ensure the long-term growth objectives we must also pursue new brand opportunities although new brands remain extremely difficult we must remember that new products OB it is learning stations delivered 7.5 billion units in 1985, I don't know philosophy is to experiment with the wide range of new product options in a real Market environment, the new brand activity is in content and aggressive concentrating in four areas specifically the value and Menthol segments in the upscale luxury packaging area and in the high-tech product differentiation Zarina, as the low price value segment became more important we made an entry in this category our number one priority the price value category is segmented into two groups the value added and coupon users and the low price generic Darrell smokers to appeal to the former group we successfully tested players like 25 and watched it nationally last month the pack selling concept is 25 cigarettes for the price of 20 or, 53 cigarettes in every pack the advertising is both contemporary and stylish and should attract both Richland and Century smokers are carton selling proposition is a standard 200 cigarette carton but I had a dollar 50 less than most other brands in addition we'll be offering $1 carton coupons to reduce the retail price of a carton $2.50 making it competitive with generics and very appealing coupon users, however we realize that to attract the hardcore generic smokers we must first offered them the everyday low price of a generic then to differentiate our product we must deliver a good tasting cigarette not currently available to them to meet this objective we have reposition the team bridge in 1986 as an established brand name at the lowest price to you, the advertising will clearly convey the good taste low price message as well as stand out from other low price centuries Cambridge is in the initial stages of this National Rollout after the value segments are most obvious area of opportunity is the menfolk category menthols represent Twenty Eight percent of the market and p.m. shares less than 17% well we haven't been successful in developing a free-standing product for this segment, we learned a great deal from last year's Rio test Market Rios red packet is deepest imagery we're not enough confirming the new Menthol brings like others need to deliver a true and unique consumer benefit from this experience we plan to test Menthol brains with real product differences this year the first como te re is a flow around product which retains moisture and, for delivers but fresher tasting cigarette moderate gives us both a point of difference flow rapper and a research confirmed benefit extra freshness which we call moist mental the third area of exploration is Deluxe packaging the success of Benson & Hedges Deluxe ultra lights and the high degree of Interest generated by the players black path indicated that there might be room for another upscale brand introduction, so we contracted with roughness for the Dunhill name we then went into test Market with an American Bloom done the test began in June and is continuing to run with very restricted seals results the appeal for a u.s. luxury product in the current Marketplace appears limited we are we are continuing to evaluate the tests that are considering a more targeted approach using an international Virginia blend, product and package for a real product difference this positioning may have a stronger long-term segment appear, barking when work at this we're watching very closely is conquered with this revolutionary adjustable filter well consider Eternal levels indicated significant interest in this concept repeat sales have been less than satisfactory however because of the uniqueness of the drive in an industry with few real Innovations we plan to review the test results and relaunch and do test markets in 1986 with much stronger benefit oriented advertising, because Menthol smokers has shown stronger interest in the concept that none Menthol smokers we will concentrate only on the manifold backends realizing that cigarette Innovations could stimulate incremental volume and Shear we are also pursuing other real Innovations such as low side stream nicotine free and self-extinguishing cigarette, the accomplishments and problems of 1985 set the stage for the objectives of opportunities of 1986 our agenda is a straightforward one and combative we will continue to push mower oh and Virginia slips to new heights we accept the challenge of stabilizing mirror medicine and hedges through a combination of new brand tactics strategies and line extensions we plan to be a major factor, in the price value segment with Cambridge players and others if require our president has described 1886 as the year and retention well recognizing our tremendous accomplishments and inroads last year we remain challenge to become the number one cigarette company at retail after we prefer to create a little for competitors we intend to unseat RJ r-- from the retail system Supremacy that they've held for too low, whoa, although the new product new technology game for cigarettes is difficult and sometimes discouraging we are resilient and determine in both the men flow and the high technology areas, we have set a course for continued progress in the new cigarette industry with your help and support along with that of our colleagues the operations R&D engineering corporate Affairs human resources and finance I'm certain that we will know how have no trouble conquering nucleus thank you Frank I believe we're ready to take any questions that you may

Mohammed so in one of the cells, so the spreadsheet, appearing on the back of the first page of the exhibit does have an address field okay and what's that address, address line one says Hamlin Hamblin NeuroScience Center PC editors line 2230 Bowman Street, and, thank you do you see turn to page, return to exhibit 23 the three-star list that we've looked at, do you see dr. Muhammad saw first on the list cell 7:35, yes okay and do you see that it's got the same exact of duress as is on exhibit 35, yes okay and it looks like so now that you see you've got the same address you got the same name on your three-star list and the documents exhibit 35 are you ready to recognize that exhibit 35 is Mallinckrodt called out on dr. Mohammed Jackson you can answer, I still can't verify that this is actually a call record well let's get down to the significance we know Mallinckrodt has records for win all the people on the pill Mill list that was provided by Todd Dean to Mallinckrodt we know the last time those people were detailed by looking in Mallinckrodt, sales visit records Fair injection, according to procedure the sales calls on the targets which appeared on a sales reps Target list we're to be recorded in the the call system so for example you look at 35 exhibit 35 can you look at the back page of exhibit 35, and do you see that looks like somebody called on dr. Mohammed and February 2014 or at least that's an indication, Junctions The Forum Foundation Edition facing the fact that exhibit 35 is where it is so the last page of exhibit 35 has a spreadsheet which has several records which indicate dr. Muhammad's name and indicate Gates of 2014 don't point at us, you don't dispute the fact that Mallinckrodt some got records that will show when all the prescribers on the pill Mill list were visited by salespeople Fair Jackson assumes a fact not Nevins action Foundation, based on our processes we should have made record when any Physicians or other prescribers who are on a Target list within the territory were called upon so Point as you said earlier we wouldn't be calling on the prescribers after they were identified as pill Mills and we can test that with Mallinckrodt sewn internal call records right objection, the process was that once a provider prescriber was identified as questionable and recorded as such to be removed from the target list that the sales representative was immediately allowed to stop calling on that prescriber it's point is although you're not subscribing to our call records we can get Mallinckrodt school records and just know for each particular person Abdul Rahman, Ahmed any of these people on this pill Mill list we can figure out when the last time somebody called on them was very Junction for, any prescribers listed on any list if they are or worried one time included on a Target list there should be records in the call system of when those targets were called upon and you believed it would be improper for Mallinckrodt to Target a provider who had been identified as a pill Mill that's your view session form objection scope, providers which had questionable business practices who had where there were identified reasons why our sales representatives and our sales team felt that those were inappropriate prescribers those prescribers could have been and should have been taken off of our Target lists and so we'll just have to look at Mallinckrodt records to figure out whether Mallinckrodt, new to detail these pill Mills after its own sales force identified them as pill Mills Fair section 4, there was a process by which any questionable prescriber was identified was verified as being someone that needed to be taken off of the target lists and if through that whole process they were verified as being inappropriate and shouldn't be on the list then the team was instructed to not call and those prescribers were taken off the target list and let me remember is the process going to be something that the fellow who's testifying tomorrow, Arrow can tell us about not you who's responsibility is it to tell us about that process this witness is telling us about the process okay let's just make sure we got that and what was the process when somebody identified a pill Mill how is it determined what the next step was section 4, when sales representative had reason to believe that a particular Target or particular prescriber who was not a Target was questionable potentially inappropriate potentially not a good Target they the sales representative was instructed to report that information up through management and there was a process by which management would verify that and, submit that provider to be removed from the target lists Okay who in management made that decision, the process was that if the district manager agreed with the sales representative that this was in fact a prescriber that they didn't think was appropriate to Target that that was considered sufficient information, so it's the district manager who's part of the sales force that would decide whether or not to remove a pill Mill Junction for me, the district manager was charged with ensuring that the sales representative verified that the issues which caused a provider to be questionable were truly present and that that they supported that sales representatives decision that this was not an appropriate prescriber did, district managers were district managers given incentive compensation, Junction form objection beyond the scope, I don't know the details of the incentive compensation for the district managers was the process whereby a district manager was responsible for deciding whether or not a pill Mill report warranted further action was that written down on a piece of paper anywhere, injection for, I'm not sure I completely understand sure is there a document I can look at that explains the precise way in which a district manager was supposed to address a report of a pill Mill,so the information the process by which the prescriber lists were to be reviewed was issued by the sales operations team when when they issued a request to verify prescribing list so is it is it written down in a standard procedure how you deal with a report of a, a pill Mill by a salesperson amount of crops actually full, I am not familiar with a specific document that I detail that so when you say it was the sales manager that would make the decision is that just based on your understanding of Mallinckrodt practices objection, my understanding based upon the information that I'm aware of in terms of the requests that were made to the sales team indicated that that was the process and so there's nobody outside of the sales team that would be involved with that process, section like a foundation seems a fact that it's, the removal of a particular prescriber from Target lists could happen in a number of other ways potentially though those other methods could involve people from outside of the city but this method where somebody reports with pill Mill that you've been describing this method would involve the sales team Fair, checking for the the method for a sales representative reporting questionable prescriber up through his or her management would involve the sales team and let's turn to another document, turn to a new area here is Exit 36, let me ask you before we move on to exhibit 36 do you know how many times they pill Mill was reported up to Mallinckrodt and the pill Mill was not was not removed from Alan Cross call us Chechen lack of foundation, I'm sorry I just want to point out the exhibit 36 you just handed me I got two copies of that assume that's a duplicate, I'm sorry could you repeat sure before we move on to exhibit 36g matter how many times a pill Mill was reported up to mount crap by the sales team and it was not removed from now on crutches I'll call us cherish inform Foundation as soon as effective evidence I I can't quantify or put a number on the amount of times that a questionable prescriber may have been reported up, management and the target list was not changed as a result so as we sit here today you can't tell me how many pill Mills in Tennessee Mallinckrodt was actively selling to say 2014 session form section Foundation assumes a fact not evidence, if questionable prescribers were still included in Target lists in 2014 I can't tell you which ones may have been or how many there may have been, let's turn to exhibit 36, do you see exhibit 36 is a June 28th 2012 email from Christopher Clark to Jennifer terp yes okay Christopher Clark was part of Mallinckrodt so sales organization Fair,I believe that is correct okay and Todd Dean has copied he's the one that reported the pill Mill lists all right Jackson for Todd Dean did report the questionable prescriber list referenced in one of the private exhibits who's Jennifer turp do you know, Jennifer turp was a member of your V commercial analytics or sales operations team they don't recall what that team was called at this point in time and what's what does that team do that Jennifer trip was part of that team was involved in the analysis of prescription information, our nation and in the the targeting process in conjunction with the outside Consulting Group that we worked with at that time, what was the outside Consulting Group CSS Associates and what did they do they provided the full analysis the summary information and the internal reporting that was necessary to drive that the targeting plan, and, do you see that Chris Clark says hello again Jennifer this is the information that we spoke about a mate about on May 21 2012 dr. Frank McNeil write a script for a worker's comp case that was filled at Ballou drugs 2002 on North Broadway Knoxville Tennessee 8655 254 187 this is not just any example go script because the patient received 28 of the 16 milligrams drinks a Day capitalized except, isolation point and it has yet to show up in IMS do you see that I do and fair to say that 2616 mg tablets of Exile go in a single day is a remarkable dose just inform objections School,the quantity referenced here on this prescription, is a larger number than what we would I think typically see what would a normal dose for exalt Gopi exotic 2016 mg strength injection form objection scope eggs all go was labeled for one dose a day but the quantity, terms of milligrams of product to be dosed per day was not directly limited and it was labeled based upon the prescribers knowledge of the patient and an assessment of the appropriate dose so you think typically a dose would be a single 16 mg strength a day, objection, form objection scope, I can't say sitting here what the typical dose would be, well 1828 16 milligrams that would be 448 mg I take it that was a dose that was viewed as indicated by this email is improper objection form section scope I would say it was viewed as surprising or unusual I'm not sure that I or the sales representative, we're in a position to necessarily deem it is improper so it was anything done about dr. McNeil's prescribing of 2816 mg strength tablets per day to the person receiving the prescription objection form objection scope, I I do not know in this document does not say what may have occurred was this sort of prescription indicative of diversion objection form objection scope,this particular email doesn't give enough information to determine what exactly happened, well let's turn to the next exhibit, do you see that you've got in front of you exhibit 37, yes okay and do you see this is from this fellow Christopher Clark who had reported this very high dose prescription by dr. McNeil I do do you see now he is sending Paul Clarke his list of targets, I see that he is he has sent an email to Paul Jones where he says here's my list of targets, can do you see one of the targets is beard and Healthcare, that is one grouping on this list okay and do you understand that it's dr. McNeil's Clinic objection, I don't have any way of tying those two together and okay do you say that on Christopher Clark's Target list it's got beard and Healthcare and it lists a whole series of providers A there are five names listed below the beard and Healthcare title so can we assume from the document that's exhibit 37 that Christopher Clark in February of 2013 is detailing beard and Healthcare, she actually form Foundation, we can assume from this list that these five names are related to beard and health care and that Christopher Clark reports these as targets I can't say what if anything from this email what if anything Chris Clark did to about those targets to mallik Road I have a policy with respect to an office that contained a provider, that have been tied to Diversion did Mallinckrodt sales people continued to visit with the other providers in the same office Josh inform Foundation seems the fact that, I'm not personally aware of any process that we had for that's for how to handle that particular situation let's look at the next exhibit, do you see you've got in front of you exhibit 38 nicer and do you say that it is an email from DJ Horton to Christopher Clark, I had a cracked and he says I forgot to copy you yes any forwards an email that DJ Horton sent to build nickel on March 1 2013, that appears to be correct okay and in turn that as a that forwards and email Christopher Clark to DJ Horton from February 28th 2013, sorry just reviewing what I have here that a that appears to be correct do you see Christopher Clark said to DJ Horton in a email and title beard and Health Care DJ I want to pass along a hopeful success story if you remember the office that I took you two had recently changed medical directors not an uncommon, nothing in Tian ha ha and had brought in some legal counsel with dr. Epstein from Florida to make necessary changes even painful changes for the group in my conversation that day I introduced him to exalt go wall clings and he requested I put one in each of the exam rooms to see that I do and do you see that he describes activities at the beard and, care clinic and then concludes this is by far my largest Clinic opportunity was so much uh see business and being former current in there yesterday that, wait let me start over again do you see in Chris Clark's email he says in his concluding sentences this is by far my largest Clinic opportunity with so much uh see business and being former current heavy oxy prescribers I've targeted them heavily with the free voucher offer and was told when I was in there yesterday that three had been given out this week we shall see over the coming weeks how this plays out and how the impact, act with dr. constant has in this practice do you see that, yes I do and so Chris Clark is saying I view beard and Healthcare as a clinic opportunity Fair Junction, I think Chris Clark is describing an experience he had with Bearden Healthcare which he had identified on his Target list, and do you see that he is saying he's targeting beer and Healthcare as a group of former heavy oxy prescribers, Junction form, he describes beard and Healthcare as being former / current heavy oxy prescribers and do you see that then DJ Horton passes this information on to Bill Nichols and says Bill a great success story below from Chris Clarke continued from the events that took place last week keep in mind this is the largest pain clinic in Knoxville and 80%, scent of all Oxycontin scripts in Knoxville County come out of this one Clinic do you see that direction is where the document okay well let's step back then tell you what do you see the email from DJ Horton and to build nickel on Friday March 1 2013 I do why don't you read the first paragraph into the record Bill a great story below from Chris Clarke continued from the events that took place last week keep in mind this, largest pain clinic in Knoxville and 80% of all Oxycontin scripts in Knoxville County come out of this one Clinic, okay so what he's saying is this is a great opportunity This Is What DJ Horton is saying because we are now into the clinic that's largely responsible for the Oxycontin scripts in Knox County Fair objection this characterizes the document this document is outlining the activity that Chris Clark has engaged in with, with the Bearden healthcare clinic and DJ Horton notes how this Clinic fits in and the Knoxville County I mean he says look these doctors in this Clinic are responsible for 80% of the Oxycontin scripts in the county right, he doesn't say doctor specifically but does say this Clinic is responsible for 80% yes and he's now talking about the great story of Mallinckrodt sending it salespeople into the clinic responsible for 80% of the Oxycontin scripts in that County Section form, eggs all go was a long-acting strong opioid for moderate to severe pain when in situations where around-the-clock pain control was was needed and was determined to be needed by the healthcare professional that's a very similar indication to Oxycontin therefore opportunity for example go would be, with patients who were identified by their Healthcare Providers as being appropriate patients for Oxycontin do you know if Mallinckrodt ever became aware that Oxycotin had been subject to significant abuse and diversion exceptionally broad vague beyond the scope, I think Mallinckrodt was generally aware that Oxycontin is often reported as an opioid that is misused abused and diverted so Mallinckrodt was aggressively targeting a clinic that was engaged was the dominant player in the sale of a product associated with diversion, objection form Foundation beyond the scope Mallinckrodt targeted providers who were currently prescribing Oxycontin among other things and targeted them with educational efforts to try to show them how oxy how exalted go may be an option for them for their appropriate patients as opposed to Oxycontin, we had professional educational discussions based upon our approved labeling with licensed and active prescribers for the purposes of educating them about the appropriate use of example go, okay what turn to the exhibit that exhibit 11 for defeat chronic pain now book, and open it up to page 175, yeah do you say that in in that book on page 175 it states in under the heading 200 does do opioids cause Addiction in chronic pain patients do you see the second sentences where sure you have read the newspapers and seen on TV accounts of people claiming to have become addicted to Oxycontin do you see that, I do see that sentence in that paragraph Yes so were you worried that that with it widely known that Oxycotin was often diverted where you worried that you are selling into essentially replacing one diverted drug used by drug illicit drug users with another drug objection Forum Foundation scope, simply because Oxycontin was connected to some cases of diversion or addiction doesn't mean that Oxycontin was an inappropriate drug Oxycontin Was An approved drug FDA approved it FDA approved the labeling which indicated how Oxycontin was supposed to be used in appropriate pain patients eggs all go was also an approved drug with an FDA-approved label for similar patients, and, we're people worried that the McNeal Clinic the previous talking, I would let me just point out one thing do you see that DJ Horton points out that patients were lined up out the door at the make me at the at the clinic beard and health care, it's the second paragraph do you see in his email that DJ Horton and a second paragraph notes that patients are lined up out the door which exhibit this is exhibit 38 thank you, object to the form of the question mischaracterizes document, so this document in the paragraph you're referencing says Chris said the office was so engaged and interested in how to fix their oxy quote-unquote problem that they stayed in breakfast for almost two hours and patients were lined up out the door when they were done so he noticed he notes the oxy problem at the clinic Fair, he notices something that they referred to as an oxy problem and then he notes the patients lined up out the door Fair objection this objection form, it states here that the provider stayed in a breakfast for almost two hours I would conclude based upon that the patients were lined up out the door because the prescribers were the providers were backed up and appointments were being missed well reading this document exhibit 38 with the patients lined up out the door the heavy Oxycontin scripts would you conclude that the beard and Healthcare was just a big glorified pill Mill Junction Forum Foundation, Vision scope, based upon these emails and the information contained here I would conclude that we had reason to believe that Bearden Healthcare saw a lot of patients who were prescribed Oxycontin and that there was reason to believe that it would be a place where eggs all go might be appropriate for some of those patients, let me answer the next exhibit, do you see this exhibit 39 is a email from Eric Hickman to Paul Jones on March the 2nd 2013, I do do you say this is a day this email is sent a day after the email that is exhibit 38, yes okay and do you see that the email that's exhibit 39 from Eric Hickman to John Paul Jones contains a series of emails and forwards the emails relating to Chris Clark's work at the beard and Clinic we can policy Jones lot John Paul Jones, let me step back and just say that again do you see that this email from Eric Hickman to policy Jones includes a description of Chris Clark's visiting the beard and Health Care Clinic, exhibit 39 at the bottom end of the email string are the two emails that are at the bottom end of the email string on exhibit 38 okay so Eric Hickman on March the 2nd 2013 is talking about Chris Clark's work at the Bearden Clinic Fair, yeah, okay so Eric Hickman on March the 2nd 2013 is talking about Chris Clark's work at the beer and click Fair let me take a second just to read this, so in this top email from Eric Hickman to Paul Jones he does reference a discussion with Chris around the emails at the bottom of the email chain okay can you read the first sentence of Eric Hickman's email in tight with the subject re Bearden Health Care, I talked with Chris this morning before this email sounds like a big glorified pill Mill and whoopsies hope Chris can turn it around could be a big win for him okay so Eric Hickman says that the Bearden Clinic sounds like a big glorified pill Mill Fair objection Forum Foundation scope those are are Hickman's words in this, this email but again I can't identify from this email exactly which connotation he is referring to with pill Mill and that wasn't the term that was that hadn't accepted consistent definition within Mallinckrodt, so here's another document in which Mallinckrodt executive calls a clinic appeal Mount do you know whether Mallinckrodt took any Step at all to address or respond to this report of a pill Mill made in exhibit 39 special form Foundation scope, this this email uses the term pill Mill to refer to Chris Clark's Target customer but I cannot from the context here conclude that any conclusion was being made or any any assertion was being made about that practice, so you don't you don't know any action that mound crop took with respect to Eric Hickman's identifying beard and Healthcare as a as a big glorified pill Mill section for foundation assumes a fact that that evidence beyond the scope, I don't read this email to necessarily Define how Eric Hickman is using the term pill Mill or to call for any specific action relative to that and I just want to make sure that however you define it you can't name any action that Mallinckrodt took after Eric Hickman said beard and Healthcare sounds like a big glorified pill Mill, to address the pill Mill issue same objections, I cannot identify any specific action that Mallinckrodt took in direct response to Eric Hickman's emails or any of the words that he used in this email let me answer to other documents exhibit 40, do you recognize that exhibit, I recognized it in general terms what is it, this appears to be an attendee sign in sheet from some sort of sponsored event related to exalt oh and, is this is it typical for Mallinckrodt to have it sales people have people that attend an event sign in, if if salespeople sponsored an event such as a speaker program or a lunch they would require that all of those in attendance sign in, and so so you can look at this attendance sheet and see the people who attended a program at beard and Health Care Associates on March the 1st 2013, that appears to be the the content of this document yes, one hand to another exhibit, 41, do you see that I've handed you a news story that says that it's entitled to East Tennessee doctors plead guilty to drug charges, that is the title at the top of the page and do you see one of the doctors of plead guilty is Frank McNeil of Knoxville projection for, sorry I'm taking a second to read a little bit of this to your I'm looking at,okay you see Frank nail is from news reports is Frank McNeil has pled guilty to unlawful distribution of a controlled substance Jesse Jackson School, so this document says that frankly kahlan be of Knoxville Tennessee plead guilty to one count of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance and do you know that Frank nail operated beard and health care which your employee described as a big glorified pill Mill actually form Foundation let's go I do not know that independently but you've mentioned that, man to another article assist exhibit 42 do you have in front of you a document which is a new story from Knox news.com and tell opioid crisis some providers named and States Opana suit disciplined other still practicing yes I see what okay and can you turn to the, to the fifth page and look to the bottom of page and tell me if you see a headline dr. Frank McNeil Knoxville, do you see where it discusses Frank McNeil, sorry just getting good page yes I see a paragraph that starts with dr. Franklin heal and do you see that paragraph the story States the board of medical examiners disciplined McNeil license it's a general practitioner in Tennessee since 1985 for inappropriately prescribing narcotics in 1994 but he and his wife family practitioner dr. Janet and Neil also disciplined at the same time appealed the action and I, 97.1 at the time they coat onto the pain management clinic beard and Healthcare Associates were Frank McNeil supervised several nurse practitioners and we're Janam and they'll still works you see that and beard and Health Care is the clinic that your employee called a big glorified pill Mill Junction form foundation in scope, as far as I can tell this is the same beard and health care that's referenced in the Eric Hickman email and that is where that is the clinic that Chris Clark was organizing learning events at in 2013, Jason form solution, based on exhibit 41 learning event when learning program was conducted in March of 2013 and if you could real quick and we'll wrap this up turn back to exhibit 39 can you pull that up, okay and do you see this is the exhibit where Eric Hickman refers to the beard and Clinic as a big glorified pill Mill do see that I do do you see anything in are Kikkoman statement or any other statement in which anyone suggests that Mallinckrodt take any action to report this, glorified pill Mill to any law enforcement Authority especially for my Foundation seems a fact not in evidence this characterizes the witnesses prior testimony, from this email I can't conclude that Eric Hickman is suggesting that anything illegal is occurring okay you don't think that when you call a clinic a big glorified pill Mill that you're suggesting that something illegal is occurring at the clinic, traction again the term pill Mill had an informal usage in many different potential definitions and connotations I can't conclude from this what Eric Hickman was specifically meaning by that term go back to my original question do you see anything in this email or have you seen anything in any of the emails we've looked at in which any Mallinckrodt executive learning of Chris Clark's activities at, and Healthcare cautioned we need to report this practice to law enforcement session form Foundation is characterizes the witnesses testimony scope, based upon the emails that we have reviewed, the information provided here suggests that, this beard and Health Care Clinic, had a number of providers who treated a number of chronic pain patients and who based upon their past prescribing habits appeared to be treating patients who might benefit from exotic Oh, we identified them as targets for example go because of the message around Exile go in terms of its labeled uses and the appropriate patients for example I can't conclude anything from these emails beyond that information I mean no one in the email said you know what we need to investigate this big glorified pill Mill to make sure that if people are involved in diversion of Narcotics that they are, Tudor disciplined section form Foundation scope asked and answered, I can't conclude from these emails that, the sales representative identified anything from his interactions with the providers at Bearden Healthcare that suggested that they were doing anything inappropriate and that they weren't appropriately treating patients with pain so your testimony just so we're clear is that when a an executive at Mallinckrodt called beard and Healthcare a big glorified pill Mill that he wasn't saying anything that suggested that somebody at the clinic was doing something, inappropriately cherishing Forum Foundation is characterizes the witnesses testimony scope asked and answered now several times, what's the answer, it turned pill Mill was often used in a neutral way to indicate a practice that had a large number of prescriptions it I can't conclude from this that anyone observed anything that would suggest to them that the prescriptions were inappropriate or that there was anything going on to this office at this point in time that concern them do you know whether Mallinckrodt ever contacted, the executive who called Bearden Healthcare big glorified pill Mill to ask hey are you using the term big glorified pill Mill in a negative way for in in a way that doesn't suggest illegal activity appeared in healthcare Josh inform foundation so, I'm not personally aware of any questions to further Define that term be on this email, manage another exhibit exhibit 43, parking brake you're looking at your phone I just want to make sure it was on silent, get that Eliza break them all right let's take a break can we just wait for this last exhibit then this is the we will move on to a new sequence fair enough weenus it's sleepy time you can take a break no problem we're going off the Record at 5:30 p.m. we are back on the record at 5:51 p.m. you have exhibit 43 in front of you, yes I said an email from Chris Clark to Daniel polls offski April 10th 2013, yes it's about a field visit, yes okay and we know Christopher Clark was part of Mallinckrodt cells group correct and Daniel Paul SOB ski was he a salesperson for Mallinckrodt, my understanding is he was a district manager for Mallinckrodt parrot and that's a district managers part of the sales force is that right that's correct and set that aside and give you the next exhibit, so that 44, okay and do you see you've got a document titled cares Alliance overview, yes okay do you recall earlier today talking about the cares Alliance and can you turn to the second page of the document that's in front of you, the second page of exhibit 44, you see at the bottom it says sponsored by Covidien yes I mean this is this PowerPoint shows a cares Alliance program sponsored by Mallinckrodt, Chechen correct this says sponsored by Covidien but that can be used interchangeably with Mallinckrodt for the purposes of this document, and, do you see on the third page it describes projects currently underway,yes do you can you turn to page it's about seven pages in a title pivot influencers, okay and do you see that one of the pivot influencers listed in this mound cry document is dr. Lynn Webster checks inform objection scope, down low right hand corner same objections, yes I see that and you did Webster's on this page I think you said that Mallinckrodt had paid dr. Webster for Consulting fishing for privation and scope, at different points in time dr. Webster was a paid consultant from a lacrosse,how may I ask you turn back to the notice that's exhibit 1, can you turn the topic 7, okay and, do you see topic 7 as Malik rats monthly opioid sales amounts nationally for each state and for each City or region is determined by the state city or region where the prescriber writing the opioid prescription is located or any other measure utilized by Mountain krotz and for each City or zip code in Tennessee for each amount of cod opioid product from January 1 2006 to the present by product unit by dose and in Revenue in any other measure utilized by Malin cry, yes question what are you the person who's supposed to testify to topic 7, yes I believe that's my topic OK what can you tell me about Mallinckrodt smoothly opioid sales amounts for the state of Tennessee checks before, not sure I know what you're asking that's a very broad question yeah I mean my question is can you tell me are you prepared to tell me today how many opioids mountain crops sold in the state of Tennessee for any time period Jackson for I did not have all those men those numbers memorized what have you done to prepare to address topics 7 today I am, generally and in some cases specifically aware of and informed about how we looked at those numbers how those numbers were collected and reported upon internally and what the individual numbers mean in those types of internal sales reports okay can you tell me what reports would I look at, determine Mallinckrodt monthly sales amounts for a given opioid in the state of Tennessee Jackson seems the fact that it's objection form, those could be in financial records those could be if you're looking at volumes or prescriptions those could be through reports from like you via data set or other internal sales records let's see here's the question you're not bringing the information to us so I need to know specifically how it is that plaintiffs in this lawsuit can figure out how many opioid, it's Mallinckrodt sold in the state of Tennessee certainly from 2010 forward direction to The Forum section scope how could I make that determination so Junctions, I don't have that information to present to you today well tell me this what source of information would I look to to determine how many opioid pills Mallinckrodt sold in the state of Tennessee in the year 2012 election form Foundation, it seems the fact that numbness, those that information would either be in IQ via data or in our internal sales records okay what sort of so let me ask you so for IQ via data maintained by Mallinckrodt could one look at the IQ via data and determine all of the opioids sold in the state of Tennessee from 2010 to the present, that were actually filled at pharmacies which actually form Foundation seems in fact I know it's ikey via data which Mallinckrodt maintained would be able to show volumes of prescription products dispensed at Pharmacy within the state of Tennessee for our branded products, and what about you have branded products but Mallinckrodt also solved unbranded generic products Fair yes that's correct so how would the district attorneys who are the plaintiffs in this lawsuit determine the volume of unbranded generic opioids that bound Court sold in the state of Tennessee from 2010 for, Jackson those those sales numbers would be housed within our internal sales transaction records as well as in, if it's within the state of Tennessee would be within sales transaction records and in electronic records received from our wholesaler and distributor Partners okay so tell me about the internal sales records what system are they maintained in, so we have a couple of different systems which would collect this information we have a system called j.d. Edwards which is our product sale and invoicing system that system is the system of record for the actual shipment and invoicing of products that we sell out of our distribution center, we also have a sales data warehouse which different points in time would have processed different records received back from our wholesaler or distributor Partners which had information relative to the specific locations or geographies where they ship their products okay so the j.d. Edwards system will that show is that a system that can be used to show, so the volume of particular generic opioid products sold to Tennessee,can I hear that question so they JD Edwards system will that show is that a system that will show the volume of particular General opioid products sold the senate in the sea so that JD Edwards system would show records for the sales which we make from our distribution center to wholesaler or distributor, distribution centers or to distribution centers operated by Pharmacy chains it wouldn't necessarily give us visibility to the ultimate location where those products ended up after they were sold by the distributors, well when you say that I'm just trying to figure out if you could use the GD edit system to figure out how many generic opioid pills Mallinckrodt sold in the nine County area of Tennessee at issue in this lawsuit, based upon my understanding of the level of detail of information contained in j.d. Edwards system,I'm not sure that it would provide a complete record of all products that were sold into those geographies in Tennessee how would the Attorneys General experiment figure that out how would they how did they figure out how to use the JD Edwards information just inform scope, I'm not exactly sure let me step back I'll pull that question back what, what reports are typically generated by the eighth j.d. Edwards system, the JD Edwards system is the system of record for our actual sales transaction so any selling information regarding the actual shipment of our products from our warehouse to distribution partner those transactions would be captured within that system as well as other, contract sales details invoices for rebates and other payments going to those distribution Partners dude you look at JD Edwards system information in preparing to respond to topic number 74 this deposition, I did not review any specific JD Edwards information for this particular deposition I'm testifying based upon my existing knowledge of the types of data contained within that system was the system operating for all the years from 2010 to the present day the JD Edwards system I believe so and can you think of any report that could be generated from the JD Edwards systems, tell us how many generic opioids were sold by Mallinckrodt into state of Tennessee generation form during that period action Forum Foundation assumes a fact that Nevins, I am not I'm not sure conclusively that we could generate a report from that system which would give Tennessee specific sales information well human being within Mallinckrodt would be the best person to ask that question to, traction for my Foundation, probably be someone either within our finance department or in our information technology department you can't name the person as we sit here today not off the top of the sales data warehouse you mentioned is that sales data warehouse that contains what's called chargeback Data, the chargeback data is processed through JD Edwards and ultimately is pulled into our sales data warehouse for the purposes of more concise reporting has Mallinckrodt produced to the plaintiffs in this litigation information it believes answers the question that is posed by topic number seven, Junction form Foundation scope, I don't personally know the exact data that's been produced relative to sales data and I'm not saying hearing you say with any specificity what actual specific system the plaintiffs could look to to find out Mallinckrodt monthly opioid sales at least four generic products in Tennessee am I hearing you correctly checks inform Foundation Systems affect not nuns, so, if we were going to look at Tennessee specific sales data the my understanding would be that our sales data warehouse would be the system that we would query we would be able to extract that data from that system what I what I can't speak to specifically is how far back that system goes how far back we archive data, but that would be the system where where we would go to get that information so the sales data warehouse would provide information about Mountain crops monthly sales of generic opioid products in Tennessee fair,I believe that is correct I believe that information can be extracted from that system do you know if Mal crowd has made the sales data that one could use to generate the Tennessee sales numbers available to the plaintiffs in this litigation I can represent for the record that we have produced direct and indirect or chargeback data insulation and I just ask you is have you produced, the data we would need to generate these numbers I don't know the data I don't know the numbers you want can be generated with the data that Med Mal chronic has but we have produced the data that we have that's relative relative relevant to Tennessee that object in state does Ballantine this suspect for the witness thank you Council this Mallinckrodt have chargeback data for all its generic opioid products sold in Tennessee, she actually what we're on, so, we we enter into selling contracts for our generic opioid products which specify a contract price when products are sold by Distributors and wholesalers at that contract price that generates a chargeback transaction, the wholesalers and Distributors it is within their business practices that they could sell our products at full list price if they sold it full list price to charge back would not be generated, well how what percentage of Mallinckrodt sales of unbranded opioids is reflected in its charge spectator do you know Justin form let's go I tried back data would represent the vast majority of our sales of all of our generic products and and how far back would you have chargeback data back to 2010, again I don't know the full archive period I know that we have a certain amount of data that is active data than we have a certain amount of data prior to that that's archived I don't know the specifics around that archive period to know how far back we have so you don't know how far back can you say that it a chargeback that goes back to 2010 or not I can't say conclusively conclusively that we still have the chargeback data, 2010 do you have it back to 2013, based upon my understanding of how much data we retain I believe that's pretty close and if I said to you you know what I'd like to find out how many tablets of generic oxycodone Mallinckrodt sold to a particular zip code in the state of Tennessee in 2014 is, is that is it to chargeback data that you would look to get that information objection objection scope, so charged bag data would provide visibility a certain level of visibility into zip code level sales from our wholesaler or distributor customers to the pharmacies to which they sell, chargeback data is limited in that certain of the pharmacies that purchase from wholesalers have agreements with those wholesalers to Blind the data whereby we wouldn't get specific location information in addition some customers some Pharmacy chains that manage their manage their own warehousing and distribution process once we sell to their warehouse we then lose visibility to where that product those so we can't tell, quickly which pharmacy then within their Network ends up purchasing so we would have visibility to some portion of our of the final sales of our product into Tennessee but it wouldn't be 100%, okay let me make sure I'm clear the chargeback data you just described that's in the sales data warehouse that's correct okay and you've talked about limitations but that is the data you would rely on it Mallinckrodt to come up with the best number about the sales of unbranded generic products in Tennessee is that fair, objection form on the ocean scope that would be the most comprehensive data that we have understanding that there are certain limitations to it yes so to find out the sales numbers for Branded products we would look to IQ via data Fair, objection, I QV a data would give information about prescriptions dispensed which would potentially give a more complete picture of the geographies involved the Branded sales did have some level of sales data reported back, back from the wholesalers and Distributors which may give some geographical information to where those products ultimately ended up but I can't say whether that's very comprehensive, yeah I'm not I'm not trying to be tricky I'm literally trying to figure out this information so am I right that I keep you that is where we look to get the amounts of the sales figures for opioids that are branded in the state of Tennessee or is there a better source of information for that with him outcry generation Ford Foundation as soon as a fact that evidence, and I'm not trying to be talking around the subject it's just it's pretty complicated and I'm trying to give you a picture in the most efficient way possible if you're looking at, prescription level information about our branded products IQ via data would give a very specific geographical base view of dispensed prescription volume for our products in Tennessee what I don't know is if we still have that data how far back that data might go if it's comprehensive our internal sales data that we, I have would be similar to the data we have for generics but my understanding is it would be even less complete than it is for generics now you've talked about the complexity of the data relating to mount cross sales mounts why coming to this deposition just didn't you bring Mallinckrodt it's best to answer as to its sales amounts nationally for each state and city and region of its opioid, it's Castle I'll stay for the record that we objected to this topic is inappropriate for a rule 30 .26 deposition we directed you to the data from which the information to the extent of exists can be derived topic 7 welcome to cover and figure out what you learn about the data providing but you have the best information available to Mallinckrodt been produced let me ask you sir, are you familiar with Arcos data, Joshua beyond the scope I am, generally at a very high level familiar with the term Arcos data name is Arcos data reliable, Jackson beyond the scope I I don't know enough about our Coast Data to opine on how it's used or what stay in there does anyone at Malik Wright use our Costa, Jackson beyond the scope my understandings of seems effect on us my understanding is that our Coast data is used or created somehow in relation to our DEA compliance teams work and suspicious order monitoring activities but I don't know the details fair to say that you're testifying, I have my own car today and Mallinckrodt doesn't have any opinion on whether or not our Coast Data is reliable Jackson young scope I'm not prepared on that topic to State what malekith position is, turning the topic 9, are you the person who's supposed to speak on topic 9 Communications buyer with Mal cross chief executive officer concerning abuse or diversion collectively or individually let me say that again do you see topic 9 on your notice it's exhibit 1, I do you see it says Communications by or with Mountain Crest chief executive officer and or directors collectively or individually concerning the abuse and diversion amount credit bi-products the severity of the opioid crisis in Tennessee the marketing of opioids in Tennessee and the sales practices related to Mallinckrodt opioid products and Tennessee do you see that yes I use note for the record that we have a written objection to this topic okay so based on the objection have you not come prepared to talk, on this topic, I have prepared to talk on this topic to a certain level of detail okay what a Communications from Mount crested chief executive officer have you identified that you're ready to talk about Jackson form over time our leadership including the chief executive has issues, internal Communications and external Communications in the form of press releases relative to our opioid products as well as relative to certain activities and position statements regarding opioids have you identified a statement by amount Co-op board member or the CEO specifically addressing do, diversion of opioids in the state of Tennessee, Jackson seems a fact not in evidence, I have not seen a document that specifically deals with the diversion of opioids in Tennessee have you seen a document that specifically deals with the shipment the illicit shipment of Mallinckrodt opioids from Florida to Tennessee and surrounding states session form judging assumes effect on humans I have not seen a specific document from issued, from our chief executive really leadership regarding the shipment of products as you stated have you seen any document involving the chief executive in which the chief executive articulated any specific steps that Mallinckrodt would take to address the problem of diversion in the state of Tennessee same objections,I've not seen excuse me I've not seen a specific document that is from our chief executive which details steps we would take specifically relative to Diversion Tennessee, have you seen any document from your chief executive at Malik Rod that in any way addressed the issue of pill Mills selling Mallinckrodt products, objection seems effect on evidence objection form, I have not seen a specific document from the chief executive which deals specifically with the term pill Mills or as it relates to our products, have you seen any document in which the chief executive of Mallinckrodt identified any specific step that Mallinckrodt would take to alleviate the opioid crisis in the state of Tennessee searching for my Foundation,I've not seen any statements from our chief executive related to specific steps that we would take to alleviate the opioid, not sure how you stated it but how you stated it in Tennessee does Mallinckrodt is a company take any responsibility for the opioid crisis in the state of Tennessee cherish inform ejection scope, Mallinckrodt takes the position that the opioid crisis as it's commonly referred to in the u.s. is the result of many different factors and many different parties have a role to play in trying to help the nation recover from the opioid crisis, we have we have a position on things that need to happen on things that are appropriate steps that are manufactured like Mallinckrodt can take to do our part to help with the crisis, I've given you an opportunity to say whether Mallinckrodt takes responsibility, in whole or in part for the opioid crisis in the state of Tennessee does Mallinckrodt take responsibility and Florham Park for that price has traction form Jackson scope Jackson asked and answered, again Malik rat has put out a number of statements relative to our position on how I manufacture like Mallinckrodt can be part of the solution and the appropriate ways that we can help to alleviate the crisis that's a manufacturer of opioids does Mallinckrodt have a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent diversion of those opioids, an objection form objection scope, I'm so that particular question I feel like is perhaps a little bit outside of my topics but our company is regulated by the DEA we're regulated by the FDA and it is our policy that we will follow DEA and FDA regulations and do what we're required to do in order to ensure that our, Acts end up in the right hands and are used appropriately we're going to take a break and back just a minute we're going off

hhhb0039,"RJ Reynolds tobacco company is one of the largest cigarette companies in the world and manufactures about one out of every three cigarettes sold in the United States Reynolds tobacco is a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Incorporated a leading consumer Products company that also markets well-known brands of cookies crackers gums cereals and candies around the world, our Jr was founded in 1875 by Richard Joshua Reynolds who left his father's tobacco farm in Christ Virginia and moved to a small town called Winston North Carolina with an investment of just more than two thousand dollars in a plot of land a factory and equipment rentals started his own tobacco company Richard Joshua was an innovator he knew that if his company were to grow he had to meet the changing preferences of his customers, verse in 1913 he revolutionized the tobacco industry with the introduction of Camel cigarettes with an Innovative advertising and sales campaign camel became the nation's top selling cigarette in just four years Through The Years Reynolds tobacco has continued to emphasize Innovative thinking as our founder did and today the company has almost one-third of the domestic cigarette Market, tobacco was achieved that success by maintaining the highest standards of quality at every stage from the tobacco advised to the product delivers to the consumer tobacco is purchased through the auction system by expert buyers trained to recognize the finest tobacco, in its Journey from the field to the consumer tobacco is important to the US economy, tobacco is the sixth largest cash crop worth almost 2.2 billion dollars more than 55,000 people are employed in tobacco manufacturing representing hundreds of millions in payroll dollars, welcome to RJ Reynolds tobacco company and to being a part of its bright future we believe in research and development and throughout the company that the Innovative process will help us not only grow earnings but also grow market share and one of the ways that we plan to do that is through our new Innovative products and processes and using the Innovative approach, to make that happen is one of the goals that we have for the Tobacco Company what possessed are indeed to get into culture change was the realization that people is what makes a difference in a business and really all the businesses is a collection of people who want to accomplish something together and in order to do that you have to have the right kind of culture to do that you need an Innovative culture that's based on trust respect for differences and we wanted to create that we had to recognize the personal growth, Earth was an essential component to that we had to encourage that we had to have programs that would start with Innovation start with teen work start with diversity programs and then sustain those over a long period of time and we knew that if we did that that we would Unleash the Power that individuals bring to a workplace and in creating products that would be a value to this company and to help us in the marketplace and that's really what we want it to do,Hey listen if apples are two atoms as Mona Lisa is to laptop as 7 is to 13 then Marilyn Monroe is to mr. Einstein what greenbags are to gold cards and what foil is two filters and what Joe is to Joe, then can you doubt that the alarm clock has gone off that the coffee is ready that we're in the 2-minute warning, RJ Reynolds approach to creativity Innovation is very different than those found in the rest of the world it's very unusual to have a successful cultural based on Innovation and creativity programs such as we have we have a lot of people that they are acceptable to change I think Innovation is being open-minded to change in different ideas and so I'm glad to see that Innovation is, going in R&D and I think it's very important for our company mistakes are not punished ideas are valued and I think that by experience that's the best way to teach that thing because everybody knows that people don't do want their ideas and it will do something with them so I think rather than encouraging its expected I think does the that's the best answer we attend what a lots lots of different Arenas of creativity and thinking and Innovation and, or to update our skills so that we can help others in the company as well as our Indie solve problems more effectively and also facilitate that problem solving a tardy there is no formal process for ideas and suggestions many other Industries take that approach when they create an innovation program in their company and looking at past experience that was exactly the thing we didn't want to do because that is stifling in and of itself so the idea of network around here is pretty much between, people miss this networking that they call it is very very important and as time for us to start sharing our information as you know that some of the international companies have already been here to RJ our benchmarking us and I think that as dr. land has spoken today we're going to be having more and I hope we can put our best foot forward in this net regard but we recognized very early that measurement tools are, it's of success were difficult to identify for the Innovative process we also recognized and understood very early that we needed tangible experiences to appropriately represent and communicate this overall effort we received some indication that the R&D Innovation initiatives were working when we reviewed our survey results and we ticked up about 20 points and that was some good news but this award is a true example and, Implement of the efforts that were started in 1991 refined re-engineered and we're continuing to nurture that process it fits right in with building the best tobacco company in the business not only do we work for smokers and we will be known for superior quality but most appropriately we will be the most Innovative tobacco company in the business, organizations need to be able to generate new ideas lots of new ideas and they need to be able to implement those ideas rapidly and effectively and that's what we mean by Innovation and just a couple of years later your organization almost in a parallel process unknown to each of us was working on the same issues and going over your materials that you submitted it's amazing how just step by step you develop the things that make organizations, a gentleman once said that we're never going to get out of the mess that were in by using the same kind of thinking that created the mess that's kind of a paraphrase but it was said by Albert Einstein and he was very right one of the things that we've discovered in our work around the world is that there is an enormous amount of attention being given to Improvement continuous Improvement I think you all have heard of that but it turns out that we're in an era where simply improving on what we've done in the past is not going to solve, of today's problems and it's certainly not going to create the kind of future that we want, so Innovation is B is beginning now to take on a new life particularly in America and I say particularly in America because we find here as opposed to many other cultures and countries is an enormous amount of diversity and that contributes a great deal to Innovation Innovation is really about what those of us in biology called hybridization where you take A and B and you put them together and produce see which is, a lot more than just the product of A and B added up, so the enormous heterogeneity and diversity of the American population contributes an awful lot to our potential for Innovation and I really think that, America is in the position of becoming the world class leader in innovation, when the network was created and the award was created one of the purposes of that was to really identify those organizations that do it, because none of us are really as many years as we may have spent studying Innovation and creativity none of us are really experts at this point in the entire process from the spark to the communication to the implementation final rewards that come from innovation, and what the network in the award or about is discovering those organizations that actually do it and finding those models that other organizations can come to and learn from from which we can all learn, the RJ our model is very special to me because where I've seen Innovation fail is where it has been looked upon as a kind of an elitist activity, where a shoe thinkers are designated as the innovators and that really has not worked very well, what we find is that Innovation needs to be ubiquitous needs to be throughout the organization needs to be from the maintenance department through accounting, and of course into product development, it really engenders a new kind of respect for people for all kinds of people different kinds of people different kinds of thinking, and it builds a new kind of community, and it's a community that really in our way of thinking about it in our organization it's a liberating of the human spirit and what I see in the Arctic our program is that there it's really a Grassroots program it's not elitist, it's spread throughout the organization facilitators at work with teams aren't selected from one particular Strava of management you really carried it out on a on a cultural change basis and made risk-taking, something that is looked upon with perhaps a little Glee in the organization is having fun as part of this deal by the way and we found out that Innovation really thrives in environments where people are having fun Jim I would like to congratulate your effort and again in encouraging and stimulating these people to really find that wonderful creative spirit thank you congratulations thank you thank you, I strongly believe in and our Management Group has heard me say the number of times that everyone in this company can innovate Rd is typically the place you think about that but in every function and every, employee in this company can contribute to Innovation and contribute can contribute to Our Success I think Innovation is is driven by a couple of things in the first very first one is is necessity and we have a clear-cut case of necessity in this company I think both because of the product category that we're in, in it's one where a number of public issues swirl around and our job there is to solve those issues for our customers so the necessity is there I think our overall direction of of working for smokers not worrying about the folks who are out there trying to put us out of business but our customers, focus in that area is it has improved a lot still has a long way to go this this wonderful Award with its independent review of what we're doing is another validation the final validation of course will be the smokers and that is our ultimate test and our ultimate Challenge and everything I see in what we're doing particularly in R&D and I think the progress we're making, making throughout the company although a lot a lot more to do is is taking us in the right direction to better serve our customers and make this a more successful Enterprise Sir George again thank you very much and thanks to you all I would say it's one of the most important days in the history of R&D a significant milestone for valuing appreciating and recognizing the importance, of the Innovative process you are the reason we're here today you made the difference their ability to constantly generate new ideas lots of new ideas and to implement those ideas effectively and quickly and one of the things that you may not recognize is how much of a leader you are in Industry there aren't very many organizations that have done what you've done and you need to be congratulated for that interestingly and, in parallel form while we were trying to find out what Innovative organizations were doing you were doing it you were creating an Innovative organization you are a very unique animal in the industry as we know it today in the United States not to say there aren't other Innovative organizations there are but there are not very many and there are not very many we've done is complete a job as you have it really is exciting for someone like myself who is analyzed this for six or seven years to find somebody who's actually doing it the right way, way what we're discovering around the world it doesn't make any difference where you go is that the process of improvement seizes on past successes and the one thing that we can almost invariably guarantee is it all past successes when push busy Beyond a certain point become great failures and what it is is taking two bundles of information that are, have some similarities and some differences and bringing them together to produce something entirely new and often that something that's entirely new is superior to anything that preceded it so one of the most important things about every Innovative organization is that it entertain the possibility of producing a lot of ideas and the and have the ability to kill the not-so-good ones fast, and the hang on to the real new ones that can survive in the environment and don't just kill everything and the Very things that you're talking about in your whole program, which have to do with diversity, with combining different nurses with teamwork and Innovation bring all that to are the mechanisms indeed that you need to break out of these patterns of the past and allow for these hybrids that have such Vigor to come into being, we need to recognize and acknowledge and publicize those organizations that are models so that all of us can learn because none of us really know how to do this even after 40 years you're doing research and creativity and Innovation I could not say that I know the answers so this business of liberating the human spirit I think as far as I'm concerned is what this award is about and it's about what you have been doing here in this, cultural work, and that's what I really commend you for from my personal standpoint is you're not just trying to pump out Innovations you don't have any leak group that is in there that are the thinker's one little step for mankind thank you, now we all know our faults and we dwell on those much too often what we don't often recognize is our strengths and I think you can only build strength I don't know that you ever correct faults but you can build your strengths and I think Innovation diversity and teamwork are the strengths of the our new organization so that's just one example of where we have to be reminded from time to time that we are incredibly innovative, the daily stuff gets in the way but long-term we're a very Innovative culture about three years ago we did some visioning as an R&D organization and we have a lot of input on that visioning and we came up with our vision which has driven everything that this group has done for the last three years we are the world's technical leaders and developing quality tobacco products when we wrote that down we had a lot of discussion well that isn't true we are not the world, later, some people didn't think we were but you will never believe you'll never be something unless you believe you are something so we said we would do it we would pursue our vision and we will win an environment of trust Innovation diversity and Teamwork because I think all of those three things for things go together in Being innovators and I also remember at the visioning process that we had this wouldn't it be great remember that activity wouldn't it be great, and one of the things we said wouldn't it be great if we were recognized around the world as the most Innovative Rd group in the world, we believed we could do that because if we hadn't believed that we wouldn't have done it people are encouraged to increase their skills and to do problem solving using Innovation tools and techniques we are encouraged to go train and get training where possible so overall through Management on down and through the whole course of our activities we are encouraged to use innovation and we notice the future of the company, a man has long been set apart by the ability to Envision his own future to create an ideal which he can aim toward and fulfill his

hhhj0223,"top story tonight at 5 5 Indiana retail associations are joining forces to keep tobacco out of the reach of minors it's illegal currently to sell tobacco to kids but that hasn't stopped some of them or some of the Retailer's eyewitness news reporter Kendall Jones joins us now with more on this plan to crack down level well and you've probably seen me sign that convenience stores or even grocery buddies got to take responsibility for this we're stepping up to the plate and taking responsibility with week hard, but it's important that I think we create awareness that this isn't just a retail problem we're going to take the initial steps but it's everybody's problem and we need to deal with it the Indiana Coalition for responsible tobacco retailing has come up with a program to prevent tobacco sales to minors retailers will check the ID of individuals appearing to be under the age of 18 if they attempt to buy tobacco products Kentucky retailers are ready to get tough on teen smokers about 40 retailers attended a training session on, say no to minors trying to buy cigarettes a new outdoor campaign to stop the sale of tobacco to children and teenagers is up and running in Louisville it is called week hired if you're under 18 and smoke retailers are warning you they won't sell you cigarettes retailers are letting teens know in a big way they won't break the law the Kentucky Coalition for responsible tobacco retailing unveiled this billboard this morning now a new national campaign is cracking down on sale to minors it began today in San Francisco, and Channel 7's Heather issue Morrow joins us with details Heather well Dan anywhere you can buy cigarettes you're going to start seeing these we card signs it's part of a national campaign to try to stock teen smoking mostly by educating the clerks who sell the tobacco over the counter-isil campaign to stop the sale of tobacco to minors was launched in Santa Barbara this morning Martha bull joins us now live with more on this Innovative program Martha that's right Debbie the we card program is the newest tool for retailers in their fight against selling tobacco, products to minors the goal is to educate every store owner to teach their employees and inform their customers about the tobacco sales laws, you see the Nevada a tremendous response we've done a lot of initiatives here both with the mailing to retailers initially now following up with this we've also contacted vending machine distributors throughout the state asking for decals there and certainly we expect that the decal program and this educational program will go a long ways in this regard I think that Nevada has really stepped up to the plate, plate and we're proud to participate in this program today with you all I do think though it's a very collaborative and Cooperative effort and education is at the heart of all of this despite the short period of time in the week card program has been in effect in New York state I think we have seen already enormous results we conducted a survey of retailers across the state and that survey revealed that 35% of all retailers were selling tobacco products to young people but those that were participating in the week our program only, percent that's a substantial reduction I think it's an important ingredient directly attributable to the week I program I think the way card program is great yeah it's great that the retailers and the Grocer's and all of the people who are on the front lines and and having to comply with the law have the incentive and willingness the responsibility to work with us and all of those in law enforcement to comply with the law and to get the word out teen smoking nationally it's on the rise but it can, Taki program called we card is fighting teen smoking by keeping young people from buying tobacco products Jack Williams was in Frankfurt tonight where people in the fight against teen smoking say we card is working it's looking

30 percent selling to minors we believe that this turnaround is due to Greater Merchant awareness of the law, we believe that is also due to programs like we card, the Coalition for responsible

hkhb0039,"hi there I'm deadly re as jimster are outlined in his letter contained with this video RJ R must reverse our full price trend in camlann select Our Best Bets to accomplish that goal this video is designed to explain to you how we're going to establish momentum on select quickly so how do we plan to do it and what makes us think it will work it takes two things and you got to have both and they are, a better idea and two that are programs camel is the best example of this one two punch I can think of Joe Camel was a better idea for a number of reasons but what really got the consumer to change their behavior where the ongoing incentives to buy camel with appealing premiums together the better idea Joe Camel and the better programs retail premiums got it done it took both so let's talk about select first we got to, have an idea something to brand can stand for we need to put something in the minds of consumers if we don't place a clear idea in their heads select will not work period okay so what must this idea do and more importantly how will we know it will work we've used three criteria in its development and you should judge it in your own mind against these measures and they are is it unique is it meaningful and is it credible, so what's the idea we're going to convince smokers that select is made better it's that simple, so how's it made better it's made from better tobacco what's better about it it's perfectly aged what difference does that make aging is the key to smooth flavor just like fine wine or whiskey tobacco Mellows as it ages in a sentence select tobacco's demand perfect aging because you can't rush smooth flavor this is not unlike Folgers using only Mountain grown coffee beans because they make the richest tasting coffee, Budweiser has spent considerable time talking about their exclusive feature would aging process cores built a brand on Rocky Mountain spring water will be using three key elements to communicate this message the primary one is Turtle which quickly says we took our time and slow down second is our perfectly aged seal look for this to show up everywhere and lastly actual tobacco leaves which provide a, a lot of impact and interest for smokers you'll be seeing combinations of these elements in point-of-sale in premiums in retail displays and in every communication, so let's apply the test is it unique I can't think of another brand saying anything like this most smokers have never even seen tobacco to me that represents an opportunity to make an impression in people's mind one that will stick is it meaningful we believe it strikes at the heart of value and people are more interested today in getting their money's worth than ever before and lastly is it credible from the start smoker, I have always said select sounds like it's made better why else would we have called it select so hopefully you'll agree we have an idea that can work but that's only half the battle we may have the better idea but where the better programs, so the better program involves really engaging smokers and asking for the sale and involves something called personal selling it goes beyond hanging some point of sale running some ads and sitting back and waiting for it to work that strategy will not work anymore smokers just aren't that interested we've got to turn up the heat with every encounter we've got to say hey I've got something important to say here stand here take a minute and pay attention we're explaining the select, already consumers and then asking for a commitment at NASCAR races were not just saying here's a pack of Winston enjoy the race we're taking the time to give consumers a clear reason to switch to select one last point on this think about the reasons we've all heard people give as to why they smoke the brand they do we can list them on one hand I like the taste I always have my friends smoke it that net they don't have a lot of compelling reasons that's another opportunity we can provide them, reasons to smoke select starting with all cigarettes are not created equal the tobacco makes a difference that makes sense to people you'll see this new approach in all of our programs so before I turn it over to Rick Sanders who will explain personal selling and more detail I'd like to say we think we have something here that can work we believe we have a better idea and better programs to bring that idea to life it won't happen overnight it will be a slow building process but if we stick, with it and remain true to the idea I'm convinced we can make select work I hope you agree I'm Rick Sanders vice president of account marketing Services You Know Field sales has always had a promotional offer to give to competitive smokers that we meet at retail but if you're like me you've always wondered if your consumer Mission efforts really made a difference and resulted in the switch well as Ned Larry told us a moment ago a good trial offer, or by itself just isn't as effective as it used to be in converting adult competitive smokers it takes more and that's were personal selling comes in personal selling uses three critical steps rather than the one step of just making consumers and offer first you provide adult smokers with a real unique meaningful and credible reason to switch to our brand just like the product reasons Ned talk about on, second as we've always done you give them the opportunity to try our product right on the spot with an offer that's hard to turn down an offer is such as our consumer Mission offer and third you invite them to join a program that provides intensive follow-up to our initial contact getting these smokers into these follow-up programs means that your initial contact will be reinforced with that smoker over and over again, now using all three of these steps in your personal selling efforts can make a big difference a big difference in smokers interest in our products and a big difference in smokers acceptance of our products and that translates directly into increased share for Our Brands and increased earnings for the company now you may say well that sounds good but can I really make a difference well let me tell you, in the average Convenience Store only for competitive smokers have to be switched to Winston select the provide Winston with one full SharePoint increase in that store or smokers means one SharePoint increase, I think with personal selling that's very doable just think of how many smokers we see in an account each month and you can begin to realize what a powerful tool personal selling and be it allows you to do what you do best the cell rgr products to competitive smokers to retailers and the family and friends, we'll provide you with the tools to make personal selling easy and make it fun now one more thing before you begin this three steps of personal selling with any smoker it's very important to follow one key guideline, only approach smokers who are 21 years of age or older if they look to be under the age of 30 make sure that you verbally verify that they're at least 21 years old, so as you've seen personal selling is a new technique that can be used for all of our Brands but it can be particularly effective on our full-price investment Brands camel and Winston select, the demonstrations you're about to see will only address Winston select but as was mentioned earlier will be sending you a video on Camel in the coming months, now let's take a look at personal selling in action, hi I'm Brian Stockdale senior Marketing

an opportunistic program that has proven to work after 16 years with RJ are 11 and sales and five and marketing I know the issues you're going to face on personal selling it's not going to be easy and it won't work for every smoker don't get frustrated, by Rejection it happens to all of us over 60 of us been practicing for about three months now and I've identified four key things that work best and make a difference in your approach they are number one never lead with have you tried it often leads to immediate rejection number to start with friends cashiers people you know to become more comfortable with the message number three know the story about select, so you don't end up reading from brochure number four be confident comfortable and committed to making a difference there are also five key things that are important to smokers they are different tobacco is what makes cigarettes taste different and we're to Once to select tobacco is aged to Perfection like fine wine or whiskey number three are flavor-sealed wrap protects the perfect ledge tobacco and its moisture content number, for select fruits are worth twice as much in our continuity program and finally NASCAR

thank you, hi I'm Frank Creighton Senior Marketing Manager for Camel in Winston and I'm Bill Duffy national manager sales planning as you've just seen personal selling lets us do one-on-one conversion by giving smokers of reason to switch to support your conversion efforts we've developed a personal selling kit which highlights the reasons for selects outstanding taste with a special emphasis on perfect aging by using analogies to find wine and whiskey smokers can better understand the, the aging process the kit contains a brief explanation of the select expert panel and consumer offers available a name generation card is included that you will want smokers to fill out including their date of birth and signature then just Mark the completed cards with your employees stamp and mail them to the address on the back of the card each full-time employee will receive 15 kits to get started as Brian demonstrated, you can utilize your existing consumer Mission coupons to purchase the smokers free pack after they've purchased one, it's important to know that personal selling is not easy it takes practice by first converting family friends and Retail clerks you can become comfortable with this type of selling our objective is to generate quality names not quantity the company will be making a big investment behind each smoker to convert them from their competitive brand of choice so we want smokers that will be open to switching Brands now Fran will take you through what smokers will, see by joining the expert panel and how the company will invest in conversion Fran thanks Bill switching a competitive smoker cakes lots of follow-up when you send us a smoker's name we will begin a series of follow-up mailings to encourage the smoker to switch to Winston select these are the steps that we have planned for the follow-up phase of the program within two weeks after we receive the response card you send in the smoker will, leave to free packs of their preferred select style and the first of three surveys which solicit their opinions about the product and the panel every three weeks after that throughout the 90 day period we will send a personalized communication about Winston selects product a survey to encourage feedback coupons and product offers to support their commitment to smoke select at the end of 90 days, smokers who have completed the surveys and sent in UPC proofs of purchase will receive a free carton of Winston select and a freeze of the lighter then they will be automatically enrolled in the Winston winners Club where they will continue to hear from us in the future we know these tools will make personal selling a big success for you and for Winston select, hopefully you'll agree with me and the others in this video that we do have a better idea and we do have better programs personal selling is a better program that can really sell the idea in the minds of focus if a field sales is an opportunistic program and I want to stress the word optimistic that can make a difference for both select and Campbell the primary accountabilities of course Remain the execution of the right programs and plans with our wholesale and Retail customers, use your time on those activities should not be sacrificed and after we have achieved our objective in those key areas personal selling can make those efforts pay real dividends

Booth Gardner vetoed it saying there is no evidence that employers are abusing their Authority right now that hasn't gotten out of control has been pretty well checked, asshole I don't think you want to pass this kind of legislation in anticipation that something will happen the governor got a lot of support letters from those in the business community and medical industry we have to be able to work together to create Healthy Lifestyles along with an excellent Healthcare System if we do one but not the other we won't have accomplished as much as we could accomplish so so forth for the governor also came from people like Bob Fox who heads the group fresh air for non-smokers, so certainly a victory for employers it was a victory for the Health Community any smoker who was passed over for a raise or a promotion would use the argument that he was passed over because he was a smoker while the governor and some lawmakers and supporters across the state considered this as smokers rights legislation others say it went far beyond that protecting those who may be overweight or those who want to take part in high-risk, at ease off the job I have been told by people who have interviewed me that I'm too fat for the position it will a lot of times they won't even look at your application these two women say the lack of a tough law limiting restrictions in the workplace could result in continued discrimination, now Governor Booth Gardner told me he's very content with his veto of the so-called lifestyle bill but he did point out that there is a delicate balance in life and I'm in fact employers get carried away with all kinds of restrictions on private time there may be the need for legislation now tomorrow night we'll go inside some Western Washington companies that will tell you if you're a smoker please don't apply that's tomorrow night at 6:30 well presumably the bottom line is at work here and that's why the companies are adding these restrictions, well yes indeed in fact some companies just don't want certain kinds of people with their Lifestyles working for them but the bottom line is money if they can save money then they'll have the restrictions so you tomorrow more of those back in our state employers actually have the right to restrict what we do after work well Gina might do things like impose rules on skiing smoking cigarettes or eating too much you might wonder why companies do that tonight King 5's Dan Lothian shows us in his special report whose life is it, Pam ones are eight diverse it ends in Seattle is the largest in the Northwest employing around 6,000 people smokers are no longer permitted to work here with the exception of a few grandfathered into a 1986 ruling the decision was based on health reasons few potential employees have fought the hospital's policy when we clearly identify a lifestyle as being harmful that it's up to us as Healthcare organization to do whatever we can to to eliminate that, lifestyle Swedish is currently offering incentives to its workers who smoke to help them kick the habit, at labels West the wooden Bill company which employs around 100 people six are smokers they were hired before owner started keeping smokers off their payroll incentives to kick the habit or also offered hair this practice is legal under current state laws we do not hire smokers and the reason behind that is that was not good for their health and this helps us to have people attend work regularly some companies won't hire people who smoke simply for personal reasons but what really lies at the center of this controversy, insurance rates don't hire so-called high-risk workers they say and you'll end up saving money in the long run that is what officials that Alaska Airlines say is behind their policy to hire only non-smokers it is a policy they clearly outlined in the newspaper ads company officials refused to go on camera but told us by phone it's common knowledge that people who don't smoke costs less but officials were not able to provide paperwork showing the savings since the policy was put in place, either were most insurance companies we contacted with the exception of King County Medical Blue Shield based on statistics I looked at the savings conceivably could be anywhere from four to maybe eight percent which is very significant over a long period of time the savings they say lies and claims costs and reduce premiums not only for hiring non-smokers and non-drinkers but those who stay away from high-risk activities off the job or those who are not overweight the incentives, there is really a person is overweight they don't qualify for insurance because we know they're going to have a hazard and a lot of companies will not take them to incur that extra claims pain I don't know if I call it discrimination but I would say this people that have Lifestyles that contribute to higher costs Omar other they should be held accountable for it once again these restrictions are legal but the ACLU says way out of line spoiler is are deciding that they, they should become the health police for people who happen to work for them the co-chairman of the National Association for fat acceptance agrees with the ACLU it makes you mad that people feel that they have the right to discriminate against simply simply on the basis of how they look but this is the kind of practice experts say is sweeping the nation employers see it as necessary for good business others are asking how far restrictions will go and wondering whose life is it, now officials were the companies we talked to say being able to restrict employees in and out of the workplace within the law is to their advantage they point to a decrease in absenteeism and an increase in productivity that thought has been challenged but so far a law to cut back on employers power off the job is not on the books now tomorrow night looking for a job while overweight my close some doors even though you're qualified as tomorrow night at 6:30 okay is there concern that if these restrictions are pressed too far, that's some really good workers would be eliminated from those companies will certainly in fact will tell you that is unwarranted discrimination it is legal in our state not to hire somebody because they smoke take part in hazardous activities or way too much who pays the price King five dead Lothian continues his series of special reports tonight asking whose life is it, lifestyle choices are creating a new hurdle for employment here in western Washington leaving what some called victims of restrictions from Seattle resident Becca rule on this morning she's off to work at her downtown office she enjoys her current job as a telephone operator but enjoying work in fact just getting work was a challenge not too long ago I have been told by people who have interviewed me that I'm too fat for the physician whether the position is in front of the counter, being a receptionist secretary or something or whether it's behind the scenes where nobody will see me accepting rule is part of Napa a National Association for fat acceptance members meet on a regular basis for entertainment and support most are very happy just the way they are and want employers to feel the same way everybody has something they would like to change mine is not my size mine is my teeth I would like to get braces for me sighs acceptance is the same thing as racial stuff, right where many people like you a lab resident 28 year-old Janine Mueller is also comfortable with the fact that she's fat she's a student at Pacific Lutheran University changing careers from fashion design for large people to public relations are there any fears yes there are for the first time I'm out there and I have to compete against regular people of persons of regular sized a lot of people are very negatively impacted by person sighs you know they think that we're lazy were stupid were, Ellie you know we sit at home watch soap operas eat bonbons all day and that's not what I'm about equally upset about what is referred to as lifestyle discrimination are smokers some of them here in western Washington say employers won't tolerate their habits now remember we're not talking about taking a puff on the job but on private time for I can do the job it's not going to handicap me it makes me feel like I have some sort of disease every president Jackie crab says her smoking has created a, area for employment in the medical records field got an application I went to fill it in and as I started to fill it in up in the upper left hand corner it said for health reasons we if you are a smoker please do not apply I was so angry I was Furious whose life is it employer say it's yours but if you want to work for them they set the rules in this state that's legal the so-called victims of Lifestyle discrimination are, Ting and hoping for change it's kind of hard to change attitudes you have to work on them one person at a time the entire world cannot look like Barbie I'm sorry we're different people and each person can present something different to the world all right now only 24 states have laws prohibiting bosses from discriminating against employees lawmakers in Hawaii and Florida have approved similar measures but they haven't been signed into law Washington's bill was vetoed by Governor Booth Gardner last, but he did however say if employers do get out of control with restrictions there may be a need for legislation stand to these people like Jackie crab the smoker plan to fight back to the are they being a concerted effort well certainly a lot of these people do plan to fight back but they're really trying to get organized right now and they plan to pressure lawmakers in fact with their voting power they're hoping to get a law on the books that will protect them in the long run the damn there's an interesting alliances here you have the American civil liberties Union fighting the employers on this but also the tobacco industry playing, quite a roll certainly Even in our state and this particular Bill the tobacco industry pumped a lot of money they lobbied heavily for this particular legislation that's how it's been in all 24 States but these bills also deal with more than just smoking hazardous activities overweight a lot of those things that we've seen over the past three parts here interesting questions that thanks, still ahead on King 5 News the grass needs rain but vacationers need what they thought and Como's family doctor bill crowns is here now to explain that and some other help using the day Bill Eric and carry another study points to the health risk faced by non-smokers who live with people who smoke are recent study shows non-smoking women have a 30 percent higher risk of lung cancer if they're living with us smoking husband, and the more espouse smokes the higher the non-smoking mates chance for getting lung cancer the New Orleans study is the largest ever of its kind extensive tests were performed to confirm that the wives in the study were not closet smokers themselves researchers say secondhand smoke in the workplace and social settings also presents a genuine health risk to non-smokers also researchers say mothers who exhibit workaholic type April as you'll see in a special report it's legal in our state we want the head, head first, next it is illegal, yeah he's smoking message is getting through to millions of adults but despite all the warnings more children who smoke are starting at a younger age today in the Journal of the American Medical Association to studies which appear to show a relationship between teenagers who go on smoking and a particular advertising

Camel is one of the most promoted images in, Modern Advertising history since the campaign that features him was created for years ago it is stops the decline of a brand that has been rolling off the assembly line since 1913 and started a bitter controversy over whether the cartoon that replaced the old camel is selling cigarettes to Children tobacco industry knows that hundreds of thousands of their own customers a year are dying off because of their own product who are the replacement customers kids the makers of camel, Earth is a smooth Joe is just as appealing to grown up our Market is not here's our Market is trying to reach 35 million smokers who smoke another brand it has the no compelling evidence that smooth Joel clearly appeals to the underaged until today with two studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in the first study groups of high school students and adults, were asked to rate their attraction to the smooth Joe adds the results the researcher who did the study says if the makers of camel are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to reach adults they are wasting their money the kids loved him the adults didn't we found that camels are 10 times more popular among kids than they are among adults over the age of 21 hi and something about the ads appeals to even the very young in the, can study children 3 to 6 years old were asked to match a company logo with a product have you seen that before what does that match with very good one third of three year olds matched smooth gel with a picture of a cigarette how do you know

hmhb0039,"I'm tardy actually consuming his heels in the lobby for half an hour and he is yep I'm really happy we block what's your name, the most likely be in The Argus Leader people do Falls Argus Leader, so exciting for a couple minutes about the clothes licensing fee for selling cigarettes in South Dakota to your organization's position on that first can I ask you a couple of questions how much do you know about stuff could join marketers Association never heard of you before today how much do you know about this proposed bill that was forced to do and I know what the keys are involved in as your food, well sounds like it's how much do you really know about the future business what story is the convenience store business I don't know what a sea story this afternoon for convenience store or toothpaste is by grocery store, first is just going to tell you a little bit about the fisa industry do some common misconception first of all these are businesses usually our small business owners and the small business owners usually work on very small profit margin so you just mentioned you got your toothpaste cost too much but these owners are operating in very small margin and that's a very big misconception what about some big misconception that there's a high margin, on products and convenience stores in the prices you're just saying that there's a dispute that there's a very small margin they work on very tight profit margins in the store they don't make that kind of cash also convenience stores because this is such a major item for is really tight focus on not selling tobacco to Youth and we've done a lot of research in these areas, to that effect if you look at grocery stores they have a higher rate of fact facilities in convenience stores so that's also a misconception of the industry they just like you do know them they would be affected by this regulation as well my company that could employ marketers does represent a 600 small businesses throughout the state of South Dakota and those are every community in the state so when I was talking about Sioux Falls we're talking about small towns like if switch and volatile and Rosco Come to Papa, under 500, for those of you just starting specifically what is it about this but I assume you're opposing this is what P we just sort of the bullet point list of why you're supposed to first of all can this bill is not a helpful this is a tax bill and this is the tax bill that would affect not just, consumers and businesses date it would affect those Industries highly for the following reason this bill if passed would propose is to put a thousand dollar fee on to every cashier in every convenience store in the state of South Dakota now that feed let's just use for an example in Pierre South Dakota done Sinclair he employs 15 people in that store that would be fifteen thousand dollars to have to pay that fee now as a small, - over working at small margin he would not be able to absorb fifteen thousand dollars he would go out of business so he's going to have to pass that on to the consumer not just do the price of tobacco products but in milk in pop and maybe bread that you can pick up at the convenience store so it's going to affect your pocketbook as well as a smoker's pocketbook it also creates unfair competition if you're familiar with Fortran of Casino in moral rule which is 60 miles away from families Don Sinclair is that, therefore once again now that's a Sovereign Nation that's on the Standing Rock reservation here and they're not subject to the laws of the state of South Dakota so if he had 40 cashiers at the casino or convenience store out there Debbie forty thousand dollars in Revenue loss to the state of South Dakota because he's not study to that that puts unfair Advantage for him over my owner in Pierre South Dakota so you can see mother, it has to do with lost Revenue in the state of South Dakota military bases will take military bases there are the same the reservation they are not subject to the fees of the state of South Dakota so if you know he's a lost revenue and you know what happens in the state when we moved relative One Source the subject of increase of sales tax comes up and I don't think anybody in this case want to increase in sales tax would you like an increase in sales tax again, and the bottom line for the most important Point can is by putting a tax on a product is not going to solve the real problem and that appears to be the real problem that is youth consumption or purchasing of tobacco products that is accomplished through other mediums as education and in our industry there's been a lot of research on this and we've put together great Coalition throughout the United States with 70 National Organization has called a weak heart presentation, you and I have a little kid here in this talk all about Ricard it's got calendars that you take on your counter that 4 car teenager's to the cashier cannot open it says if you were born before F d'etat next year you can just simply look at that it's got stick-ons for the cooler doors and it's got a lot of other promotional information that would be really good for you to take a look at it it's great for the business owner so that'd be something great job okay that was reported on effects week has been an effect for five, years okay and still teacher guys cigarettes, so you're suggesting we just did you just continue the same program even though it's not been as effective as other people would like it to it that we card have been effective in South Dakota because we do have the lowest by rate of teams in the United States and that is under 10% and every time we put on a seminar for weak heart we decrease that number and that's a very proud number for the state of South Dakota to know that we have the lowest vibrates excuse me Mark is getting circles well kids usually get cigarettes from their friends or, or from their parents those are the two most common ways, it was a simple isn't it a good idea to make sure that you have a system where the government can make sure that courts are educated by adding a licensing fee make sure there is a way that these parts are doing what they're supposed to do well can we do that through educational processes and I don't see how a licensing fee is going to make any difference if the cashier is educated or not if the cashiers Not educated on the proper cardiac procedures they can't be an effective cashier and effectively, that cell to a team you support that proposal that would increase the penalties on a store for selling under 800 number well camp in state of South Dakota once again there already is a penalty for the cashier who sells to a team but more importantly there's a penalty for the teen for every give you support an increase in those funds I think finally said it a good level right now and I would not support an increase in that fine once again we do already have that long places data, South Dakota we penalize not just the cashier but the team so we're just working over 250 dollar finds the Class one misdemeanor and up to 30 days in jail and that's both for cashier and the team, what is the policy of the illegal IDs if any legal idea is used after still World well the cops the cashier if they know what they need Eagle ID they need to compensate that ID if they do not know what's in the he's Eagle ID, then they're obviously not going to confiscate it and it will say is there a penalty for selling for a clerk to sell cigarettes to a minor uses a fake ID you know because they don't know the fake ID,now these are all over there bit like stings which is there the courtroom as young as 13 years old by the cigarettes how do you say you have a working system we have a problem well can I guess I can address that is yes there was five things yes we were caught five times I don't know the present circumstances of if that 13 year old was using a fake ID that's a possibility that they were using a fake ID, there's a lot of 15 year olds that look 18 years old Camp if you just I mean I suppose you couldn't guess my age yeah that is a mistake that can be made again I'm not sure of the circumstances that cashier could have been presented with a fake, these those cashiers though that did sell did get a penalty they were reprimanded on that, what should spread which remains will come out cold weather is such a wise answer, well tobacco is a legal product is so adorable, I just think it's too much government intervention and again this is a tax bill that so if this had come first and then the alcohol wasn't so you would have fought the alcohol licensing and said it was okay for the cigarettes okay we're kind of getting off the subject here I understood that we were talking about licensing for tobacco and the time is getting short and sorry to interrupt you there or they do have a meeting I need to go to 0 wish I'd known that earlier I think we arranged for 10 minutes of this interview Kendall but anyway so, so you're saying there is no difference between I can see you in America because there is a difference between tobacco cigarettes in this matter it just that one is already licensed you don't feel the other one sugar let me try that again without the interruption, the job sir there's there is no difference really this matter between tobacco and alcohol you just don't want to see another lesson 7 on I think the licensing fee is not hitting at the core of the problem once again this is a tax bill not a health bill is bad for business is bad for consumers if creates unfair competition for all the people of the state and it will not solve the problem and this problem in fact is a health problem licensing, you did not consult that problem education is going to solve that problem to be reason I doubt that you ain't smoking is a health problem, well not saying there's no problem saying that it needs to be addressed educational and the licensing fee, license license, that's that's okay when you say education I mean the week I program once again so you see here that Clarkson be advocated that thing that everybody needs to be educated better team feeder educated children need to be educated and we already presently do training for our clerks so you're saying that everyone is one of the dangers of smoking everyone needs to learn proper, I was right there so I just wanted to say that no one should talk with education to say smoking is cool the way to your exam so once again this is not about that it's about dormitory thank you very much, tell him about it, this is a different one, this is this this one you had deck okay we're going very good I wonder first of all charges if you wish to make an opening statement check check to be sure that I'm not in my head John's mother yes mr. chairman chairman and members of the committee I would like to address this committee and advise you that our group of poses House Bill 2111 the bill that would put a thousand dollar fee on, clerk in our convenience stores and grocery stores around the state and we have several reasons we oppose this bill I'd like to make it very clear that this bill is a tax bill it's not a health bill it's going to cost us jobs in the state definitely and it's not going to start not going to solve the problem of Youth access that members of this committee think it will and it penalizes small businesses much more so than large businesses, thank you mr. Hodges you seem to be here with every sin bill that comes up you represent the snuff industry and I think you know how many people have died of cancer stuff and now you're here with this bill I just have to question if there's any validity to any of your point well I think there's quite a bit of validity to my point this is really a business issue not a smoking issue is it your contention that it isn't a serious problem, I think absolutely it's always a serious problem when children get some cigarettes but we've gone out of our way in our industry to try to educate children number one and educate the people in the stores to make sure that they card people and they make sure that they don't sell to minors you're not getting that done yet this is a fraud you're not getting that done wouldn't you agree with that no sir I do not know I do not agree with that particular show that we are reducing, use of the vacuum and you let me remind you that you are under oath and ask you that if you smoking or using a smokeless tobacco products no sir I certainly don't think there is do not think that you are under oath yes what do you base that well I based it on the number of people I've known who use the product and quit without without having any problems so you deny that your members is selling it, at the time that a correct statement that's correct and you deny that you sell products until we absolutely make every attempt not to self chilling I'm going to call that wymer was 31 years old tell us what happened when you tried to buy cigarettes there's a store that's down the street for me and I've been getting cigarettes there for almost two years now that's where my friends and I like to hang out after school, there's a couple clerks there that we know that we can just go in and get cigarettes from nobody's ever asked us for any X ID or anything my older sister she's 16 and she goes to a different store whose it's closer to school that she goes to I know she she has some idea I don't know where she got it sometimes she is sometimes she doesn't but I don't understand what the big deal is because we're still gonna get cigarettes because we, want and we like them cool is it your testimony that you have no problem getting cigarettes in any of the stores represented by mr. Hodges I've never had problems and your sister hasn't had a problem but I know another children don't you just do you just walk in and get cigarettes are you concerned about your health, I can sign, I've gotten sick yet I just curious about your reaction to that well I have a great concern there she bought them to our stores certainly and maybe depressed about that that's our decimal will certainly investigate that and if it's true the law deals with this issue and will be punishing the clerk's away we have the Russian side there's no smoking in here I'm sorry, as it is we would deal with clerks according to the law in the state of we what what you've done nothing I actually no reason why this filter effects we've made every attempt to prevent children from getting the product as I said before this this bill really doesn't even address the issue with this bill does cost jobs, we were in a position now where if you charge each store with the thousand dollars on each clerk we're going to we're going to use this money you're going to have to come from somewhere and it's going to come in our convenience store is the right and prices on all products not just about to drop you can't run a convenience store without making money and you've got to you've got to create the jobs there and we're talking about a loss of jobs at thousand dollars at work, lots of how many jobs are estimates actually we have a we have a study that I'd like to submit the community they show that we'd lose at least 2,000 jobs just over this bill alone we have this done by peat marwick and we like to submit that are testimony what would you say to this young lady, first of all I've done I'd tell her that she's really not old enough to make the choice of using tobacco products and I would ask her if I smoke same thing I would tell my job, what would you say to me the lost his wife to cancer well I regret that I'm very sorry for your loss we all take risks in our lives and if your wife had to die from smoking cigarettes certainly apologize to you and that's really that all I can say that's adequate to you he has not hit well yes it's adequate to me I you know I'm not I'm not the one who asked your wife to smoke weed, we sell the legal product adults choose to use it or not use it that's our position and we certainly are not encouraging you to use it the situation is all that the money, how is that",0.8041455429090911,0.37610927,0.9128386

hnpj0015,"adorable aren't they hi I'm Barbara my husband Bill thinks I'm crazy putting these here but will I just tell them hey the world's a crazy place and you know it's never crazier than when you were smoker take the other day I was on the street outside the office building where I work enjoying a smoke when suddenly out of nowhere this man runs up to me and yells no smoking by the building smoke there and on the curb, I was shocked I mean there was two million cubic feet of air out there now I know radical but enough is enough I'm a smoker I like smoking and I'm becoming just a tad tired of people who want to make my choice their choice, it's almost like smoking is becoming a pain these days instead of a pleasure but you know there is a way we smokers can cut down on a lot of the things we don't like about smoking, it's this eclipsed by Vantage not just another new cigarette but a real solution to a lot of the things we don't like a solution that also happens to taste, incredible first thing you'll notice about eclipses there's very little secondhand smoke dry 95% less so it gives you a great tobacco taste a nice draw and lots of great smoke but Bingo the smoke is gone about as fast as you can say thank you for not smoking and there's no smoke at the lid end my husband likes that little feature a lot oh and check this out Eclipse please practically nothing to stay in your walls or, Windows, observe, try that with your cigarette you know I just redecorated and now with the clips there's nothing to stick to these Priceless Treasures it's while who would think that a cigarette could let us cut down on the things we don't like about smoking but not cut down on the satisfaction and guess what it's not for smokers like us who are saying that about eclipses people who don't smoke are raving about it too like my husband built, now when we're together all that lingers in the air is my witty conversation, I mean my non-smoking hubby not minding my cigarettes I must be dreaming but that's what's so fabulous about eclipses it tastes great there's almost no secondhand smoke no smoke from the lid end no staining no lingering odor and no ashes you heard right so now I can use some of my ashtrays for other things stunning isn't it and now bill says all I smell like is my perfume a simple yet intriguing blend of Jasmine and free-range well flowers, oh one more thing eclipse is incredibly low in tar and nicotine too, before we go one step further I've got to show you this okay you already know that Eclipse doesn't leave any ashes that's because it mostly heats the tobacco instead of burning it like your cigarette so what, Eclipse can lie flat on the table without leaving any burn mark So if your cigarette accidentally falls out of the ashtray which happened to me once during a very exciting show on home repair it's less likely to start a fire, but how does eclipse do all this let me tell you I wondered myself but actually it's quite simple let's go to a video tape from RJ Reynolds, Eclipse primarily Heats tobacco instead of burning it that's the basis for its many benefits yet eclipse is made much like any other cigarette with a special difference a tip made from high Purity carbon this tip is wrapped in an insulating heat barrier that keeps your eclipse from burning down so the tobacco doesn't burn the rest of eclipse is a blend of fine tobacco's followed by a regular cigarette filter that's how it's made, how does it work r.j. Reynolds as you smoke your eclipse the heat barrier keeps the tobacco from burning down inside the cigarette instead when you draw warm air passes over the tobacco getting it just hot enough to create a full-bodied smoke that carries the flavor of the tobacco with it it's put it in English the way Eclipse works is something like making coffee when you pour the hot water all the flavors release from the grounds and the grounds are still there when you finish but all the flavors gone, and so you had toss it when you're done just like you do your finished Eclipse but be careful guys while smoking Eclipse because even though there's no smoke from the lid and the tip still hot so don't toss your Eclipse till it's cool down, did I mention a Clips taste rich and full-bodied but is incredibly low in tar and nicotine let's hear about it from the RJ Reynolds folks themselves, most full flavor cigarette Styles have between 14 and 20 milligrams of tar Lifestyles have between 7 and 13 and ultra light cigarettes typically have between one and six milligrams but Eclipse which primarily Heats rather than Burns tobacco has about three milligrams of tar and it's full flavor style and one in its mild Style, for nicotine full flavor cigarettes typically contain between point eight and one point seven milligrams of nicotine lights range between .6 and .9 and ultralights range between point 1 and point five but Eclipse has just 0.2 milligrams of nicotine in its full flavor style and 0.1 in its mild style and that's our math lesson for today, but here's the bottom line Eclipse taste great and is really low and tar and nicotine you've got my word on it if you can handle one more number here's the deal eclipses tar numbers may actually be lower lower than 1 mg Y how well it's because it Clips mostly Heats rather than burns the tobacco which makes the smoke particles different from other cigarettes here's the RJ Reynolds man, smoke particles from other cigarettes are about twenty percent water and glycerin but Eclipse Smoke is the reverse about 85% water and glycerin something found in all cigarette smoke as well as many food products and baked goods so the smoke particles from an eclipse are different than other cigarettes mostly water and glycerin and what happens is this glycerin is Canada's tar like the kind from a burning cigarette if eclipse is, in wasn't Canada's tar it would have almost no tar from burning tobacco well that was a mouthful but darn impressive all right Barbara you say Eclipse has great taste and great numbers but what exactly is in this thing well you know there's nothing added to the tobacco of eclipse that you wouldn't find in other cigarettes but the smoke particles are different as we saw there mostly water and glycerin which explains why all I smell of the flowers and Wyclef, smoked taste super smooth and disappear super fast just like I used to have to whenever I do cigarette of course the real deal is Eclipse is a little different it first so it is a real cigarette it's a great tasting real cigarettes it's not a cigarette alternative or any of that kind of stuff but you do sort of have to get used to it in the beginning like first of all you need a good strong flame to light can't use a car lighter you need a direct flame and you need to take an extra pump for to when you light it, and you're not going to see Eclipse burned down like the cigarette you're smoking now in fact at first I didn't think Eclipse was lasting as long as my regular cigarettes but it does about six or seven minutes I know I timed it, when you start getting less smoke and The Taste gets weaker that's how you know your Clips is just about done, I gotta tell you I don't miss my old cigarette at all not one iota because the thing is after a pack or two of a Clips you'll say like I did my old cigarettes are history I'm not going back especially when it Clips is a whole lot nicer way to smoke especially when it tastes like this, all right it's time for me to stop talking and let you hear some questions people have about Eclipse with answers from some of the folks at RJ Reynolds, once your lie to and you've smoked it can you light it again I mean you can't just pick it up and smoke it again right now I mean if it's if you've smoked the whole thing for six to seven minutes of the case has gotten weaker you've gotten less smoke and it goes out you would not want to relight it at that point because the lighter is gone what is the heat barrier heat barrier on the tip of cigarette is made out of something that is called spun Glass and its purpose is to insulate the carbon tip, to stop a cigarette from burning which is why eclipse is a lot less likely to start a fire than other cigarettes but because it doesn't burn it's not adding anything to the cigarette smoke that isn't in other cigarettes what's the carbon tip is a like the charcoal I use my grill no it's not the carbon tip is made of a much higher Purity carbon than what you find in your grill I have a question yes the carbon tip does it make it like so you have more carbon monoxide than any other cigarette now it is not Eclipse has about 6 to 9 milligrams of carbon monoxide, tag which is actually less than the leading lights cigarette does it have the same properties as a regular cigarette I mean as far as what you're in taking into your body I wondered the same thing Eclipse uses a standard tobacco blend and there's nothing in that tobacco that isn't another cigarettes that was very impressive I'm curious about the prize are they going to be like competitive with normal smokes good good question we know that Eclipse cost us more to make because it is different but we will be charging the same full price that you would pay for the, like a marble or a Carlton a Winston or a sale are we experiencing what it looks like inside a cigarette you don't get my go ahead and cut it open check this out when you're through with that you actually have a hollowed-out cylinder is that what you think's inside I would say that that number back do is come down there okay we were doing some bedding as to what was going to be inside the cigarette earlier cook tobacco ashes, tobacco I remember those hold on there is a backhoe it's just like the residue of coffee that's right exactly now sometimes people will ask is that they can take that tobacco out and re-roll it and light it up again and smoke it and the answer is no you wouldn't want to do that because again keep in mind that when you have smoked your Clips you've extracted all the flavor from it so it really wouldn't taste very good anymore than using a tea bag for the third or fourth time with taste very good now let's watch some people, try clips for the first time yeah I really like it it's just as good as my mom belies excellent excellent for you like it better than my cigarette i've smoked Marlboro 113 years this would be something I'd switch to know definitely switch my wife would praise the cigarettes in the ends of the Earth he's so tired of the smoke and the smell and the dirty ashtrays and everything else she'd love this I like the idea that you can just set it down and it doesn't burn your furniture or if you know it's pretty much, much flame retardant I just want to get home and try them on my significant other all right now you're talking you know after you've had your first Eclipse you can see how it could make a world of difference but the real test is the real world so let's hear from some folks who've smoked eclipse for a while out in the real us of a, I love that my sister let me smoke in the house I couldn't believe it absolutely could not believe it and in the fact that it tasted good I thought they were Beyond fantastic acts out of their revolutionary having first thing his suit pants no holes in the shirt I mean just that an insult who's incredible I thought the eclipse would either taste like absolutely nothing or it tastes really bad because it didn't burn like a normal cigarette Burns but I laughter I had an eclipse or two or three it wasn't you know I was, kind of surprised it actually tastes more like a cigarette than I expected it to my friend that I walk with either a drive to church or she dressed the church in when I smoke in her car she says I can't tell you smoking I think smell it I occasionally go up to the bedroom or something to change I'll have a cigarette with me and next thing you know all your clothes smell like cigarette smoke with the eclipse you can't tell that you were even in the bedroom smoking with the eclipse, was great I could still do dishes and stuff and I didn't have this Burning cigarette burning up into my face and Ashes dropping in my foot or on my laundry while I'm folding it I didn't have any qualms about smoking in the eclipse inside the house because there was no visible you know smoke anywhere and there was no smell it was it was a clean kind of cigarette I thought would be the cigarette for the next Century I thought, it was incredible it was amazing cigarette it seemed to me that they made the cigarette just for me well that's the story about an incredible new cigarette called eclipse and incredible new cigarette that gives you all the pleasure of smoking without all that secondhand smoke, there's no lingering odor no stains no ashes incredibly low tar and nicotine all in a full-bodied smoke with super taste I couldn't ask for more except maybe a beautiful 18 karat gold electronic courts lighter with a high-tech fuel supply the last one year Well paid 149 of the catalog, or maybe I'll buy it myself who knows lady with the clips marriages All Over America will get better maybe it'll be the dawn of a new day of Harmony across this great land maybe chocolate will pin your thighs, okay that was a little overboard truth is it will always be people out there who aren't going to like that cigarette in your hand period

Horgan good morning tell us exactly what is that significant evidence that has been ignored well as I mentioned on another show last evening we cannot get into an argument comparing one study versus another but while there are studies that continue to sophistic Lee link us to the diseases that we are accused of causing there is also a significant body of science that says that the case against smoking is still an open, controversy and there was no scientific submissions are in fact on file in Congress because of hearings that were heard on this subject in 1982 benefit our viewers do mr. Horrigan isn't it incumbent upon you to cite those studies yes it is and I would add that the first ad that we published was what we would call an announcement add in that ad we stated that we would go on in the coming months to discuss the issues and the challenges do it for us this morning mr., Jurgen I think we need the information fried I will only highlight because I am not a scientist but for example there are reports such as a test run several years ago by the National Cancer Institute where for several years they injected whole cigarette smoke into the lungs of beagles the problem that the Institute had though was that those beagles didn't get cancer they concluded the test and four years later though, reports are not yet published would you concede sir though that people get lung cancer people do get lung cancer but science does not know the causes of that disease, all right mr. Benz have John bands have founder and executive director of action on smoking and health that's Ash thank you for being with us this morning what do you think of those r.j. Reynolds says Hey mr. Horrigan is using an old trick he's trying to convince the audience that unless you know the biological mechanism you don't know what causes something yet we've known for example what causes scurvy or rickets back in Columbus is day long before we knew the biological mechanism we don't know yet exactly why aspirin causes a decrease in Fever decreasing, swelling but we know very well that it does it and it's not just the testicle evidence Connie we know some of the elements in tobacco smoke which are proven carcinogens we've tested scientist not I am a lawyer with Scientists have been able to induce cancer on the backs of various animals in the lungs of various animals there is no subject in science medicine that I know of which has been as carefully studied we have had for the last 20 years as open a debate as we can this is the weight of the evidence this is one sir, in General's report this has been more study than ethylene dibromide letting are any other subject on which we have long since acted the question now is we don't need more debate we need action mr. Horrigan it is your desire to have more debate the tobacco industry Institute has been debating at all these years why are you presenting this ad now for exactly the attitudes put forward by mr. Benz off there are scientific studies that he relates to that he says establishes the case against cigarettes we say, there are reports that do not establish that cause whatsoever and because of organizations like his it has reached such an emotional Peak now that we would like to establish a climate of understanding rather than the emotionalism that drives against 50 million Americans who have made a decision to smoke the mr. Harrigan you've admitted that no one study can prove or disprove the issue the question is what do the studies show when examined together by reputable scientists every study that I know of in this, answer that question mr. Berg is amazing one organization one reputable scientific organization this country any other country in the world which has ever come out the other way mr. Horgan yes ma'am can you answer that question yes we have a scientific Advisory board made up of some of the most eminent scientists and America who pass on the scientific grants that are awarded each year by the tobacco industry those are no strings attached reports or studies that scientists are free to do and they are free to publish, as opposed to studies that we say have never made the Press just a hurricane you duck the issue you're saying you have your own scientists who take a view the band's manager not you have anything like the American Medical Association band's American Cancer Society the counsel of your lawyer mr. bands off give someone a chance to respond to your points we do not have our own scientists if we did scientific research in our own Laboratories no one would believe us the fact is we have evidence psychologist or pardon me, it's who pass on grants each year they are arm's length and the scientists are free to publish the fact is for over 20 years we have published our studies whereas reports to the contrary they must interrupt you mr.

that President Clinton mentioned well there are there are many state assistance, programs that the through the USDA they work in support of State programs principally State programs that are doing conversion now there there's an estimated that the FDA estimates about a 4% cut over 10 years in tobacco sales as a result of this regulation that's not a not a huge impact because as you just heard from our health care experts what we do the impact of this overtime, is gradual it doesn't affect current consumption so much as future consumption because you're removing from the market potential consumers in the future so that the the impact on sales immediately is as much less the job loss figures that are within the documentation submitted by the FDA are are significant obviously anyone who loses a job but it's not something that you want to see happen but the estimate is over the total 10-year period probably a total job loss, lost in the agricultural sector by of about 2500 jobs roughly 250 a year his help there are there are there are State programs that are available that are helping usually run through extension service and others that are helping tobacco Burly Farmers make conversion to other crops that's principle it is, the effects of this I'll have to check on that I have not heard I have not heard anything on that I my understanding is that the we are currently fed over there is currently federal assistance for some of the crop conversion efforts that's the states primarily run yeah yes a little idea now on the present preparation for the cat for the convention one is acceptance speech in many drafts now how many speeches will it be making, stop and some feeling of what's going on yeah yeah the president is a very, comfortable with how his own presentation to the American people is coming together not only in the sense that he will have many opportunities in coming days to address them on specific issues as we get a larger National audience as he'll it makes its way to Chicago by train but obviously when he accepts the nomination of his party next Thursday night it is an opportunity for the president to put before the American people not only his vision of what America can be in the year 2000, but also what specifically we need to do to achieve that destination he's been doing a lot of work on the vision thing he wrote just as completed a book the book is very shortly available that I think it really does articulate in many ways how he sees this country's challenges as we look ahead to the 21st century so step one for him was to really crystallized his thinking in the form of a book that would be a in a sense of mission statement of what America must do for the next four years, here's what he now will do as as he addresses the convention next Thursday night is set out a roadmap of how we get to that destination what are some of the things specifically that we must do together as a country to make sure we ensure America's promise for the 21st century that we meet our challenges challenges and we do so consistent with the values that the president has talked about often opportunity responsibility community so you will see him at probably one major, major event each day Monday Wednesday Tuesday Wednesday laying out a specific new proposal or a new idea related to some of the things that we need to do on Thursday of set of proposals that specifically addressed some of the challenges he sees for the country and also tying together many of the things he's been talking about over the last six months as you get a sense of a better sense of the architecture of the president's view of both world and America is we, we look ahead to a new century so preparation he's now got a first draft, yeah it's going to tell you something funny and I can't hisses they we often call it here at the right house the fire hydrant draft because the first draft gets the treatment that the fire hydrant sometimes gets if you kind of imagine that famous whistles it's he will talk it's a lengthy address one thing we, no and obviously obviously Senator Dilan do it to he spoke for an hour unlike you since you have short attention spans the American people really enjoy listening to these speeches and enjoy hearing a candidate for president lay out specific ideas there's a reason why Senator Dole talk for an hour the length and I won't predict how well the president will talk but I hope less less than that I mean given that the length is a recurring issue for him, it's not like there's not a recurring issue for him good speeches that are well received as a recurring issue for him and when he has spoken at Major occasions like the state of the union we have gotten an excellent response, his to try to not speak longer than Senator Dole did it's a goal of his to adequately present both the vision for the future and to substantively describe how we get to that destination and to do both you need to make a fairly well-developed argument that's going to take some time the best the best known whistle-stop tour was where Harry Truman was very feisty gave them hell and so forth, and the president's been a chance now for several days I don't think they're letting up on that really going to turn the cheek every time and never find and only like Joe Lockhart he will once again suggests that the coming campaign is not about insults that politicians hurl at one another it's about the ideas that would make this country in leave this country in a position to continue its greatness into the next Century to do that, he is going to vary directly contrast is view of the future and his vision for change in America with that the opposition because frankly he doesn't have much regard for the direction the Republican party and mr. Dolan particular would suggest that we should go over the next four years he doesn't have much regard for the kind of budget that they presented him and that he vetoed and back last winter what they tried to do this country when they attempted to cut Medicare and Medicaid cut the environment cut technology, gee cut education cut those things that really will build kind of future he will describe for the country the president thinks is very good grounds from upon which to contest the coming campaign so you will hear him both contrast his own thinking with that of his opponent but also more importantly put forth a positive View for the American people feel we need to go and how we can get there now I'm suggesting that will happen during the course of the four days I think he's already, he intends to he's got an opportunity on Thursday night to really talk to the country and talk to the delegates at the convention about how this country can realize its potential as we enter and I should be very clear about what that would look like what would America look like he wants I think we've been very clear that unlike the speech given in accepting the Republican and this president wants to look to the Future and not to the Past, past and he believes that what it is is to tell America what country can be in the year 2000 after four minutes of is leadership and to tell them very specifically and reach that destination provide that kind of opportunity asset type of responsibility of people as we reach for that goal come together as an American to address the problems we Face selected along the way like like ash what is it Asperger's, I do not know I think he didn't you need to ask you need to ask the campaign it's they are key States they also happen to be the way you would get to Chicago from nearby here in West Virginia if you wanted to go by train and did not want to significantly disrupt rail or rail passenger or rail Freight Service so we find a route and then we are confident is works for the various, carriers that we will encounter along the way or that we might potentially disrupt that also works for the communities where we find people who are enthusiastic about the idea of a train trip that will be maybe some unplanned stops along the way maybe one or two set events every day that will allow the president a bigger opportunity to speak to a crowd and lay out some of his ideas and it'll be fun most of all yes might wear, has the president kept a low political profile in Jackson Wyoming during the Republican Convention Center goal is going to Chicago this weekend and will be campaigning with Jack Kemp in California at least sometime during the Democratic Convention does that offend or upset the White House no I think fireworks having as hard a time as Bob Dole Is Right now I probably do that too yeah, they invited the president to give a speech by Labor Day saying that he turned them down there at 7:00 I don't know nothing about that I'll have to check yes he said this is no accident was he referring to the marketing and advertising the tobacco companies or the addictiveness of nicotine itself well he was he was reflecting on that very thick pack of scientific data the, support the conclusions made by the federal Food Drug Administration that nicotine is addictive drug that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco or delivery devices for that drug and that the manufacturing of those products well aware of the pharmacological and addictive effects of nicotine in the Satan all of those products is all very carefully and meticulously, ported and researched in the documentation that supports the rule that FDA has designed and it's important you know dr. Kessler didn't directly but I guess subliminally in a way that thick packet of material and that thick packet of justification that will appear in the Federal Register for you know one page of easy to understand regulations that should be easy for people to implement and the consequences have been designed I think, fairly so that they minimize the cost to those who have to make these adjustments in return for as I just said and billions and billions of dollars in savings for taxpayers and for individuals and the health care expenses that we won't have to bear if we can deter tobacco addiction among young people, yeah terrorists initiatives and legislation from the White House and well the president will continue to follow up on the work that began at the G7 working with other foreign aid or designed the international Cooperative effort secularism the Justice Ministers of the G7 countries met recently and began to design a program of activity that they will, they will be implementing 40 measures that the leaders agreed to at the seven as the president has suggested he will continue to Advocate that Congress do some of the things that were left out of the terrorism legislation that most recently considered so that we can have a better structure of law enforcement tools here and to combat terrorism then it because this is a problem that in many ways the president feels defines or at least describe, some of the security challenges we face in the post-cold War era he will continue fortunately to address this looking for other ways in which we can combat the problem with Ralph from the staff and will different congressmen and governors be hopping aboard and we'll have along the wave different local officials will appear I think you might see from time to time some of the people who have been at the convention in a very, high-profile role is on the train as we get later in the week you'll see in terms of the staff we're sort of spread out in coming days mr. Panetta and several of our senior White House staff people some of our cabinet members will be in Chicago they'll be several of us traveling with the president along the train people from our campaign operation will, so in both in the train and in Chicago so and the challenge of coordinating some of this work so we make sure that everybody is connected while we're chugging along is that something that people have spent some time with working through in the last several days likely will he be enforcing Democratic candidates along the way for example and I Western Kentucky race I understand Ed Whitfield fears that I don't know about that specific race fit, the president I have found that we get a very enthusiastic response from local Democratic leaders as well they'll be a number of them present to greet the president is he States and in their communities, I take issue with that I think he is done that pretty pretty often he certainly is been helping a lot of them gather the resources they need wage their campaigns has been a lot of that type of activity and been some and me just about every event I can recall recently we've had you know members of Congress who themselves are candidates for re-election with the president and working with the president he sometimes suggested it be good for them to get another opportunity to serve, yeah can you explain going back to technically Congress can act to do some things you know I didn't I didn't catch that I would I didn't quite understand what that 60-day period is but you might want to give a call over to FDA they can they can describe that I think that is a normal review process but I'm not sure specifically how that works, they do and they end these companies and many of the tobacco producing companies that Rebecca manufacturing companies that contribute to the Democratic party and remember they are in the business of providing legal products to adults who can make a free choice to use those legal products there's nothing wrong with it there's nothing wrong with being in the business of growing Burley tobacco there's nothing wrong with being a, involved in the manufacture of cigarettes they are legal products for adults who choose to use them the whole and sole focus of the work this Administration has done on this issue is to deter and hopefully cut in half tobacco addiction by young people and that's been the focus and that they will this will continue to be an industry that provides a legal product to people who choose to use it and those companies will continue to make profits, offer the sale of those products to adult what we are concentrating on is our kids and and certainly I don't think and based on the president's decision as he announced it today no one would suggest I hope that his thinking on this issue has been in any way affected by either Factor beauticians of the presence of these companies in the political life of the country departing he will tape the radio address later today and if we go long enough, here we'll have another briefing for you on that we the president subject will be protecting communities from section sex offenders and we have an embargo briefing will occur at 4:00 by an efficient Department who will walk you through some of the background that will support the text of the President's radio address but you again later this evening a Placid he plans to take that relate to see them, so there is a the president of some time ago if you recall directed the Attorney General to establish a National Registry of sex offenders and I expect the president to report on some progress that s is the lady and and is Chelsea Clinton going to be on the train and can you indicate any of the convention stars who will be on the train for example Evan Bach know they are going to be in they will be in Chicago the, lady plans a approach should be having a lot of activities in her hometown associated with the convention she'll be in Chicago in the believe that Chelsea will be out there as well I'm not sure,a stream of emergency lights fill the runway as teams of search Crews tried to sniff out a possible bomb not taking any chances the 757 made an emergency landing at oia just before eight tonight this man saw it fly in so what I first saw was that the emergency vehicles were out there at the runway and so I decided to watch for a while and plane landed it seemed like a normal Landing the fire vehicles followed it down the runway and that was about it stop, at the end of the taxiway and I figured that was that was going to be and they were going to taxi in went to dinner we know the passengers, work awaited by 9:30 186 people were on board Delta Airlines has kept them out of our view and officials here have not commented for some passengers are curious no one here seems panicked by the threat I've got a lot of confidence that the security is doing everything they can both here in Atlantis so we'll keep lying Kim bodice Channel 6 News,well you know first I'd like to you know applaud the president dr. Kessler for taking what I think is a Monumental Public Health step in in in this rule that's being adopted that restricts the sale of distribution of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to Children and adolescents I think the information about the scientific basis of nicotine, addiction is just getting really quite overwhelming obviously we've known for many years the association between tobacco and cancer the wrong heart disease pulmonary diseases like emphysema I mean I've been well well known but I think now we also know that the majority of tobacco people are dead addicted to Tobacco start in their teenagehood in childhood about the majority of Teenagers Who start smoking continue smoking five, years later and I think this is a quite a corrective action that restricts advertising and restricts product distribution to a very high-risk population well as I mean I think is that like to say it was all scientifically-based but I think your rap you've got a major industry here who has a lot of resources and I think they've used a lot of resources to protect protect their product and they're selling their product well I think the whole environment, being a change and I think I've been in public health arena for a long time I remember the first tobacco surgeongeneral Surgeon General Terry who came out with tobacco and for a long time there was a denial that tobacco actually cause disease and then we went through I just think the evidence is getting so overwhelming that even now these little seams by the states are based on strong scientific epidemiological basis and I've been busy even in defeat ever personally has the rethink, think they have product the way they sell that product and array their responsibility to the public I think the back probably some have known are wrong well I mean at the I mean I think that if that is the case and it certainly people who believe that I think that's really very very sad commentary on the industry to actually have plead ignorance if that occurred and actually have much more scientific basis after all this is a big big industry does a heck of a lot of, research has a heck a lot of attorneys working for them and all that mean this is not this is not a mom-and-pop operation so if if their research had in fact been that good and they had that I think that was really quite a responsible let's see here that there's good by the advertising is you know has something somebody with so many industry only to only advertise to switch customers among the tobacco companies well that's amazing because I don't know any other product that doesn't like new customers, but the the advertising is very awfully done I mean Joe Camel is very widely recognized by children across this country and after all we live in a day and age where we use a lot of cartoon characters I mean I can ride down I-95 in South Florida see signs lit up with Joe Camel at night there's other signs directed towards women for other cigarettes basically saying this is a woman's issue you know making so I think the knowing the product, act that we have and knowing how how susceptible to advertising in a pressure that adolescents have I think it's about time, there was a time when a divorced man would not have made an ideal candidate for marriage there was a time when some marriages would not have been accepted by some people in our society there was a time when some marriages were so shocking to the majority that they were not legal some still are not why are Bob Dole and Congress wasting our time with new laws attacking game, then also address the issues of what kind of objectives are we trying to accomplish with the reward system what are we trying to do with it what are we kind of behaviors are we trying to get at the the figure that's that's up next shows some of the key design dimensions of a reward system that is base pay and variable pay and then the degree to which those might be based on job size skills, individual performance team performance unit performance and Company performance traditionally we've largely used a base pay delivery system for most of the work force tied it to job size and individual performance my discussion so far in this segment and he has suggested that if we want to tie it to a team-based model of organizing we need to think about tying it to skills or competencies both base pay and variable pay and we may need to create variable, Vehicles which are tied to team performance business unit performance and Company performance that through those combinations of new practices we may very well be able to create correct seems the right motivation the right attack action and retention device for a team based organization with that let me turn it back to Joe who I think is going to hand it back to the audience yes I'm sure people want some access here so again if you have any questions for dr. Lawler now is the time to call in and, if you have a question and you're at one of our survey panelists all you need to do again is press that red call Button if you're calling him by phone the number is 1-800-562-9830 on a little bit earlier I guess there's been some recent criticism about pay as a motivator would you care to comment yeah there have been actually it's they seem to come every decade or so that is a wave of criticisms new articles and new books on them on the problems with pay systems and what they show, regularly is that you can really mess your organization up by producing an inappropriate or creating inappropriate pay system that the reality is you get what you reward with a pay system and if you reward the wrong thing unfortunately you get it the other side of it is if you don't reward it you tend not to get it and many organizations have suffered from least one of two illnesses when they redesigned their pay system they've zero no one or two things that they want to emphasize so that's all they reward people, op doing other important things as a result of that or they simply fail to measure the right things entirely and they motivate all the wrong behaviors so there's no question that a bad pay-for-performance system is worse than no pay for performance system so if you have the option between a bad one and none it's almost always better to take none what I'm arguing is that there's enough value added though and doing it right that it's worth looking for a good system or correct system alright particularly when you, moving to a team environment now we've got quite a few calls in the queue so we'll go ahead and we're going to turn it over to burn in Albuquerque your question keep contributions come from what we know today is hourly or non-exempt employees and salary or exempt contributions have you addressed this concern both practically and legally any personal experience here, Allied our hourly teams are actually operating right now under a reward and recognition program and that doesn't mean just non-monetary but we label it more under the reward and recognition and our high performance teams in our sales force are of the exempt nature and so they are rewarded with an incentive plan specifically designed for sales that's where we're at at this time, I'm okay we're going to go ahead we've got since we have so many calls here I'm just going to try to move this along quickly we've got Laurie in Milwaukee Laurie hi I have two different questions one is how do you include part-timers in a team-based organization and the second question would be how do you determine the proper equity for different levels of performance in a team, well I think that one of the ways to do it is there's there are for the part-time or question anyway is there are, Rob pro-rata approaches there are and I think really when you look at the individuals and structuring pay the real key is what is it that they value and different people in different organizations value different things for instance oftentimes the and it's not always just pay I think that my point earlier was that total infrastructure is very important and for regular employee sometimes in addition to pay the reward might be time off, and as a value that they would appreciate and for part-timers oftentimes what you have is some type of proactive approach to the compensation or award that they share as a same with people who are members of teams on a part-time basis just who want to hear the equity issue of individual Equity I think I'm sure we'll hear more about because it is probably the single most common issue that comes up when organizations go to teams and they start talking about Pacey, I'm particularly unique or not if not unique strong issue in the u.s. culture we have one of the strongest individualistic cultures in the world so there's a natural tendency anytime you start talking about teams for individuals to raise their hand and say yes I'm all in favor of teams but remember I'm the best one on the team and of course eighty percent of the people on the team would agree with them that they are individually the best one not that that person is the best one so you face that pressure for individual recognition within a team environment, on a regular basis we're going to talk a little more about that when we talk about performance pay as well as competency-based pay because I think you can argue that there are different answers there that is for competency-based pay you want to pay more attention to individual abilities capabilities and knowledge whereas when you look at performance you may want to focus more on Collective performance and reward Collective performance but ask about that again later if we have an answer question because that will be a certainly A continuing Topic in the, in the presentation okay let's move along we have got Dan and Knoxville, hi dr. Lawler referencing back to what you were saying about individuals 80% thinking they're the best one on the team my question is actually for Paula at Allied signal I'm somewhat familiar with your self-directed work teams and the work cells and from what I understand from people in that organization that the teams often breed mediocracy because of the fact that the majority of the people are not you're not the best person on the team that that is that maybe the 20% and, and often that 80% that may be somewhat average pulled down the other 20% and and somewhat like I say breed mediocracy and I'd like to hear your comment on that I'm glad you asked because another thing close to my heart is that you can't do pay alone we believe it Allied it has to be coupled with other initiatives such as Performance Management and particularly Career Development and we are heavily focusing on Career Development as a vehicle to change the culture the pay, long is not going to change culture and I like to believe that these things take time to sort out which is why we don't move quickly into designing reward systems we like to have the business strategy take over and that's what's happening with our teams right now in the cells and in the operations area we're letting them learn new initiatives of total quality Six Sigma a Kaizen efforts and we're holding back the pay design just a little so that it doesn't lead it, rather lags and we are using reward and recognition heavily right now as a transition into more team-based and Competency Based approaches okay we just use your key issue I think within the team is whether they can deal with that issue themselves I think you would say Wilma from your more effective high performance work teams that they can do that they can they can overcome that within the team well that's effective teams know it's taken time it's certainly, add something that teams can do on day one but over time I think we found that the teams are often impatient to really ensure that their team is on high quality because it's really that team that's responsible for results but we do have to provide them some resources to do that I know they're experimenting with just one of the thing and that's what you'll hear and if you haven't already it's like 360 reviews as a vehicle for teams to review themselves and provide feedback to each other to try to correct that okay we just got a few minutes here so I'm, just going to go ahead and get think see if we can get a few more I think you just got a lot of people that want to access to all of you we do have John and Huntington Beach high does the panel has an example of rewarding personal development skills competencies Etc in knowledge workers for example like Engineers or computer programmers, at Monsanto we're doing that and I think we're going to be talking more about competency pay and so on a little bit later in the in the programs and maybe we should hold off on that little longer okay so it's a good idea just to make the point it doesn't of course require a team environment to do that but the kind of skills and competencies that you reward differ in a team environment from a more traditional individual work assignment environment okay so we'll kind of table that until a little further on moving on in Vernon Hills we have, see I really had the same sort of question on individual performance and individual recognition that was already asked and the work that I've done was team's what I found is people like to work as teams they tended to produce far better results as teams but when it got down to rewards they each wanted to be recognized individually or at least they wanted to pick out that one guy on the team who really didn't, pull his load and does he have to get the same amount that we do and I'd like the panel to be sure especially dr. Waller to talk to those cultural issues that we Face here yeah and I think the issue it doesn't really give you an answer just heightens the issue is whether you go with that culture in the group or you try to change it you try to create more of an all for one there's no question in the United States we like a Most Valuable Player we spend a lot of time in our Athletics for example trying to figure out who that person, those two people are and we also of course like to punish the guilty that's when probably think we're best at historically on our organizations that 1% who's clearly identifiable I think the part of the issue and again will dress it more later is whether you do that formally or informally whether it's with inside the group and their group process or whether management comes in and intervenes and effective high performance work systems teams the teams tend to handle that themselves they, they are able to discipline fire eliminate poor performers and through social recognition and other vehicles to recognize the best performers if you're talking about a very cohesive high performance team I think that is the best solution to that issue rather than have management come in in a paternalistic over overarching view and say I'll fix the problem for you I'll get rid of the bad guy or the Bad Gal and I'll see that the glitter taken care of okay thank you, and thank you for all of your responses and of course your questions right now we're going to take a five-minute break and when we return dr. Lawler is going to talk about the use of skill-based pay we'll see you in five minutes, and welcome back well let's go back to our survey panel to answer a couple of questions again have you installed cash incentives for team performance yes or no and again the question, have you installed cash incentives 14 performance that's a yes or no question you can see in the display and if you'll just press that your response we're waiting for those answers to come in, and you can see the results with about 67 percent of our audience responding must be a few people still on break but those that did respond it looks like about 60% and it's creeping up just a bit have not installed cash incentives for team performance our next question for you is have you installed recognition rewards for team performance and again this is a yes or no question have you installed recognition rewards for team performance please press the, yes or no, and there are the results and again it looks like just about six sixty percent have not installed recognition rewards for team performance so what's your reaction to those were many ways it's not surprising in fact that somewhat with the data that we've been collecting from the fortune 1000 firms over the last several decades there's a tendency in organizational change to view pay as best left in a lag position that is to let everything else change until people start complaining about the, a system and then to change the pay system in fact the star model although it argues that the pay system perhaps should be paid changed simultaneously with the other elements on the star points out that when you get that kind of Misfit you will start to hear increasing complaints about the pay system and I think often the pay system is something that only gets changed when there's grousing and griping and complaining perhaps because it's a difficult element to change and it's a complex one to, sure so it tends to lag not surprising but maybe not correct either there's some argument to be made that it can potentially be a lead variable or a lead factor in the change process in fact speed the change process along if you don't wait until there's dissatisfaction with it okay well thank you for that and I think I'll just yield the floor to you and you can go on with your third segment so I mentioned the study that we've been doing of the fortune 1000 and here are the data from 1987 through 1993 is, you down myself and Gerald Ledford and Susan Mormon as you can see there there's been a significant growth in the use of knowledge or skill base pay as well as a significant growth in the use of Team incentives and gain sharing plans so there does appear to be the kind of change that you might expect if organizations are going to more team-based environments I still think though that you could argue there's a lag if you look at the adoption of power sharing practices particularly, we team power sharing practices like quality circles and participation groups other than quality circles the growth there is what more rapid than the growth in pay system change and the penetration is much greater that is a higher percentage of the companies that we study have quality circles and participation groups than have gainsharing for example there are more self-managing work team companies than there are appropriately in, scented to company so it does seem that across the board organizations allow pay system change perhaps to lag the installation of a team-based environment it certainly is true though that they tend to go together when we do a joint analysis of the same data looking at where you find knowledge or skill based pay where you find gainsharing and where you find Team based incentives the answer is very clear it's where you have a team, based environment usually later in terms of when it's installed but always where it's there so the practice in companies is telling us that knowledge or skill based pay goes with self managing work teams gainsharing goes with quality circles and other kinds of Team environments similarly of course team incentives go with Team based environments, the challenge of course is to get the right fit between the power sharing practices and the pay system let me just focus for the rest of this presentation on the issue of skill-based or competency-based pay which I would argue is part of the general movement toward paying the person rather than paying the job for decades the basic model module or molecule in our pay systems indeed in, our overall Human Resource Management Systems has been the job it's the thing that's described measured calibrated and paid and most traditional HR systems unfortunately for most of our traditional HR systems is becoming less and less useful as a administrative device is becoming less and less useful for a variety of reasons that graphic up there now demonstrates a number of them we already talked earlier in the program, Glenn and others about part-time employees about the dynamic nature of jobs certainly about the use of teams all of those tend to push us away from having a reliable stable thing that we can pay for called a job the other phenomena of course that's happening is that people often aren't contained in their contribution within a job description many people are worth much more and contribute much more value than their job description says they do and then of course unfortunately some people, will contribute a lot less value than their job description says they do so if we rely on that as the only measure of what they're worth that is we try to price them in the market based on a job description we run the very great risk of underpaying our most valuable contributors are most valuable people and overpaying are less valuable individuals that argues I think for increasingly focusing on paying individuals paying the person now question of course, this is how do you do that and what does that look like there are a variety of different practices someone earlier in the broadcast called in and asked about engineering's and paying them for their technical contributions that is a kind of approach to paying for skills somebody has and therefore for paying the person in self managing work teams we often see other approaches and let me just look at that for a moment in terms of what we see in high performance work teams, we tend to know those environments to want to pay people for the multitude of skills they have and encouraging encourage them to cross train and learn horizontal skills setting up a system which supports that has a number of steps in it it's probably too much detail for me to go into each of those steps but let me just capture a couple of the highlights you have to be able to identify the skills and price those skills and determine in the team, environment the right mix of skills if you remember back to when we talked about the four kinds of teams each of those were identified as having particular skill needs on the part of people the challenge is to map those skill needs onto the pay system so that the pay system rewards individuals for Learning and developing those kinds of skills we tend to classify the skills and my work on horizontal dimension, a depth Dimension and the vertical Dimension let's go back to the high performance work team for a moment I think we can see how this model applies the typical high performance work team setting individuals perform best when they can do all of the horizontal skills that are needed to operate in that work group that makes them highly flexible certain individuals also need depth skills if individuals can do their own set up in a machine shop or do complex, computer programming in a programming team that can make unnecessary bringing in outside resources and can make that team more self-sufficient finally in terms of vertical skills of individuals can through a star model or some other approach learn administrative skills and managerial skills then the team can be at least partially self-directed that is it can operate without supervision the next chart that you're looking at graphs some of the kinds of skill models that I've, I've seen developed within skill-based pay systems that is individuals in this case 8 a raid against a variety of skills that need to be learned in this case for individuals are allowed to learn for skills to individuals six skills and to individuals eight skills I'm not arguing that this is necessarily a general design I'm just arguing that this is a way to think about individuals, getting learning programs or skill profiles that they can master and how correct design of a skill or Competency Based pay system requires identifying what skills need to be learned we've got another studies Jerry Ledford myself particularly at the University of what kind of skill-based plans are out there we studied them particularly in teams and we find that the most common ones reward both breadth and depth they typically allow individuals to learn 10 separate skill, units and approximately after three years individuals turn top out and cease to have more learning opportunities because they have an Essence learned all that's within the purview of that particular team there are a number of advantages of skill-based pay I've already alluded to some of them but certainly most obvious are the flexibility that individuals develop in terms of what they can do if they're horizontally or laterally skilled they can do steps throughout, entire activities of that team if they have depth skills of course they can substitute for others but I would argue that the most important advantages of skill-based pay or probably in the area of understanding and perspective that is individuals understand the entire work process within their team they can therefore solve problems that couldn't otherwise be solved and grasp issues that could not otherwise be dealt with now one of the success factors for skill-based pay one clear one is employee involvement plans that we, study that have been most successful have significant input from the employees we're going to be involved in the actual plant why because that gives them a chance to input to a known the system of course they tend to work particularly well where it's an interdependent team that is where there's a payoff for people understanding the entire process and the work team more often than not they've tended to be in capital intensive situations either Capital intensive industry, manufacturing or in the service area and where there's a great chance for individuals to problem solve and add value all of this of course is congruent with a management style that is employee involvement oriented and where management is willing to allow employees to take some control take some Authority and make some decisions the power element that we talked about earlier there's also an employee element to this employees need to be interested in learning and willing to take the risks of trying new, kills and potentially failing, finally we found a skill-based pay systems need to be constantly updated as work changes as the knowledge requirements expand or are altered the system needs to be redesigned that requires an ongoing monitoring of the system let me just summarize what we've said so far about skill base pay has to be a situation where the organization needs the skills don't pay for skills that you don't need secondly you have to have a system to be sure that the individual has, skills and finally of course individuals should only be paid for those skills that they're willing to use there's really three tests then as to whether or not relation should pay for a skill need willingness to perform and ability to perform Let me just lead into another issue that we're going to talk about more detail and that is the issue of competencies skill-based pay is a term and a concept that's largely been applied at the non-management level sometimes among technical employees sometimes among, an employee's we've seen in the last four or five years a lot of installation or at least a growing rate of installation of something called competency-based pay which typically affects the managerial population in the higher levels in the organization there are a number of reasons for this I think one certainly is the successes that organizations have had with skill-based pay another is the issue I've already mentioned the decline of the job another is the whole core competencies concept of business strategy organizational capability, finally we're beginning to see consulting firms developing products and and tools that allow organizations to pay for competencies in other words we're finally getting some alternatives to job evaluation systems and point factor systems the challenge of course in competency-based pay is to decide what we're going to pay for well here's some examples of that I think once I'm finished with my presentation we've done one study actually was the help of Jay Schuster and Pad saying I'm that has, looked at what kind of competencies people are paying for so far and you know those are shown up in the graphic and not surprisingly customer focus is the most frequently paid for one the difference between competencies and skill based I believe is more of degree than of kind and skill base pay system you can actually watch and take a work sample and test for some whether somebody has the skill or the ability of the knowledge to perform that particular task and competency-based pay your, to look for more underlying skill sets or abilities that can be flexibly applied across a group of tasks those are therefore are harder to Define and often harder to measure for their presence I think it's fair to say that this point in the area of Competency Based pay we're in a learning mode trying to figure out how to make it work how to measure it and how to develop it I'm optimistic that we're going to make some progress there and I think making progress there is key to do, developing effective teams in the managerial world and in the knowledge Work World broad banding is one method that has been used to handle the pay mechanics piece of competency-based pay that is we've gone to fewer paid grades wider ranges and job sliding and that that can help that can move us more toward the ability to pay for competencies and to reflect individual worth more in the pay of an individual but it doesn't, ultimately answer the question of how are we going to measure individual competencies and how are we going to translate those into the broad banding if we're not careful broad banding instead of ending up as a way to recognize individual contribution and competency can end up simply as a inflation there a device that boosts everybody's pay upward let me let me turn it back now to Joe and I believe she's going to handle some more questions for us up with some more questions and please again this is, your chance so if you have a question for dr. loyal or I kept what is up with me today smaller or any of our panelists just go ahead and press that red call button again if you're calling him by phone we do have an 800 for you number it's up on the screen that's one eight hundred five seven eight eight one two six and we're going to get to those calls in just a moment but glad I was curious about how have you dealt with this issue of person based pay well one of the things that said was mentioning you get it almost when you get to this discussion competency skills, his knowledge what is a competency what's the behavior there's a lot of disagreement going on in the field now about what it is and one of the things we've done to try and look at the individual a person based pay part of the equation is on teams and team struction in our organization has been to balance those two I think you have to as one of the colors mentioned earlier they're saying what are you doing about the individual piece people are on this team but they still want to be a reporter, what are individually and the use of competency-based pay I believe is a way to balance this team award as well as the competency or individual person based pay of the reward structure often times what we've done is use competency design teams in the development of those particular types of pay practices generally looking at two types of new we have called cover them both under the topic of competencies behaviors and, functional skills and our knowledge and that's just one of the different people refer to them different ways and when you hear people talk about competencies you almost have to figure out asking so what how do you divine compensation yeah what does that mean so what our competencies is the first question and we look at it in two sides one behaviors and other side of skills and knowledge the behavioral side was similar to what the side that they had showed earlier which is typically what people talk about when they say competencies and that's the communication skills teamwork skills adaptability, the dependability Etc and on other side you'll have functional or knowledge and/or skills where you'll have computer skills technical knowledge industry knowledge those types of things so we'll use these design teams to create and the basis of competencies that you're going to use to measure your performance and then pay against those competencies typically in the higher Parts organization managerial and professional ranks and then oftentimes, skill and knowledge part for more task-oriented positions okay thank you for not Paul I understand your reward systems model included a variety of incentives and rewards Vehicles so how do you use the skill or Competency Based pay well we've just begun to get quite serious about competency-based pay but we believe it should be done in tandem with performance pay and we have expounded upon a model that takes, it's a look at competencies to support capabilities and learnings and I don't believe that the slide that you're currently looking at the model that we use with competency-based pay supporting capabilities and learnings is coupled with performance-based pay which we which rewards near-term individual and organizational results, our approach is somewhat different to the traditional skill based where you pay for skilled blocks and we actually have a skill based program in effect at one of our strategic business units but what we're looking for from competencies is to serve as a profile both for hiring the types of talent that we want in our company and to serve to continue to guide people as to how to get the work done so that we're paying for how they get the work done and not, just what the work is currently we're looking to base our Merit increases on these competencies and the competencies that we develop our we intend to put through our Career Development plans we currently do have incentive plans for our account team members the earlier structure I mentioned and we are now building competencies together with the people on the teams and with hema, at Birth we want to do once these competencies are have been completed is to contract with the employees on a development plan to help them prepare for the future in developing these competencies and then perhaps pay for that contract in their in their Career Development opportunities well Mama how is Monsanto use competency-based pay I think we've done some interesting and Innovative work in this area clearly I said said, we're really in the learning stages and the work we've done so far I really see probably as a first step of many models to come but we do have a model that's been in place for a couple of years in a knowledge-based organization and we're in the midst of implementing a second right now also in a knowledge-based organization the issue we talked about earlier of you notice a change lag or lead I think in these cases it's somewhat lag but probably not as much as historically we had Fairly major organization changes, it's where we had a very broad spans of control that really made the old system unworkable and it's we started to design programs we found we had to go back time and time again to employees and remind them why are we making this change and to tie them back to the business strategy and the new products organization that we've implemented competency pay we did use the design team approach that Glen alluded to earlier we and we also built this model on novation's, we're stages model and that career stages model basically looks at an individual as they progress through their career and divide that into four stages from someone who's just learning to someone who's mastered the skill to someone who's influencing others to finally to someone who's leading as the Visionary for the organization then around those career stages we've defined for broad bands from a paper spective people in the organization can get salary increases, in one of two ways everyone is eligible for a market create marketing Kris if the market justifies that secondly and probably more importantly however they're eligible for a developmental increase if they've demonstrated increased competency and growth through their contributions that they've made and this is a very interesting process in terms of how we go about it because we use a 360-degree process for employees to use in terms of their creating a development plan then the employee actually, Ali prepares an application to apply for a salary increase and appear panel ranks the applications to determine who should actually get the increases and in any one year we would expect about half the group to receive increases so we have used a number of different Tools in this particular application that I think helps support the team structure and let the team make decisions because we feel that they're the ones that often times know better, okay terrific why no we've got some questions from our audience so what let's go ahead and get started with Mary and Boston, yes thank you I'm glad to hear you speak so specifically about the dying concept of the job if you will many of the discussions that I've had with other people and I've had an opportunity to talk with Wilma specifically at several conferences the the process for selecting competencies and for measuring them is one thing but what about the actual pricing of skill and competence doctor Lawler you mentioned, at in passing earlier this is something that I hear about increasingly from clients and from colleagues where do you begin because many of the broad banding systems are really at their heart still looking at the value of jobs in the marketplace and how do we make that transition well with great difficulty I think it's one of the most difficult pieces you could argue in some ways that ought to be simple because really all you're trying to do is price the person in the job, me price the person not the job in the market and that there is no market for jobs jobs are not hired by somebody you're fired by somebody or traded but people are and what you need to look at of course is the actual Market transactions at is how much people are hired for people who are let go because they're overpaid excetera you probably see it played out most with temporary and part-time employees who really sell their skills at a market price all the time they know very much what their, ticket prices and in company usually knows what their market price is where it gets more difficult of course is where people aren't in the market testing it regularly and you're not getting feedback at the organization level in terms of what they're worth well that that question is exactly what we faced at Ralston because when you go into the market to try and price a the person based pay it doesn't exist there's no database out there for pricing these competencies or these skills that's not require we record it and put into the system this whole way of, I can jobs and so what you use is to take that basis and then extrapolate from it using some internal Equity approaches to try and approximate the value of the competencies and skills because that database is not out there that's very very good I like your use of the turned out of us because the data is there it's just not collect my collected that's it is that we're getting hired all the time and changing jobs we don't collect it that way because we collected around jobs and job descriptions and ongoing pay here right so to some degree I think you have to still rely on the job model and then extrapolate from, that to the individuals worth the market all right we're going to go ahead and move on to e0 and Charlotte and forgive us about some of our answers are a little shorter if we ask you to keep your question a little short we do have about 20 calls that we like to try and get to in the short time so he'll go ahead with your question yes I've got a question if any of the panelists have had experience in a union environment moving for traditional pay for classification to a skill-based pay and what what they experienced in with that, that in a second question is a piece of that is experiencing actually testing for those competencies, Allied has just recently negotiated with the Union to go into a skill-based pay format and it took a lot of work they design the skill blocks with two things in mine one for operations and the second set of skill blocks is 14 and they had to present these to the union it was recently okayed and they're just embarking upon it they do see this as a three-year Endeavor and the union has agreed to, that so they are going to progress very slowly in that initiative and measure it along the way so they have also had to set critical metrics to follow through on this okay our next call comes from us from Shawn in Long Island, during this segment of your presentation you identified testing for skills as one of the key issues and skill base pay I'm wondering if you can provide some commentary with regards to the legal ramifications of the employers testing for skills so far at least looking at the skill-based pay in the manufacturing world that has not been a problem because in you most cases especially been a job sample that is a structured observation of somebody doing a task force, period of time with certain establish parameters there may be a peer review process or something in there but generally it has not been subject to legal problems as you might expect around discrimination or adverse impact I'm less clear about the area of competencies I think we're still so early in that area that it's not clear to me what the legal issues are going to be there I do get concerned with some of the Competency Based systems I've seen where they tend to Define competencies in very general terms it looks almost like some, some of the old performance appraisal forms of the 60s when we said was somebody Cooperative helpful friendly nice responsible excetera with no behavioral descriptions and no quantification of that and we already know from court cases and a long history that those are very subject to adverse impact to Legal Challenge and to substantial problems thank you thank you for your question Sean we're going to go ahead and move on to Linda and Reston, thank you my question is also about working in a union environment and I wanted to see if any panelists had any recommendations about how to move to a work team structure in a collective bargaining bargaining environment with high entitlement and individual service based pay programs yeah I spent 15 years negotiating Union contracts and and we were moving in that direction I think one of the critical components which is what Paul had mentioned was involvement with the you, early on I think you have to have a partnership what you're overcoming is a long history oftentimes of mistrust that we have created at verse relationship at adversarial relationships in Union environments and so many times the key is early on involvement of the Union in identifying the ultimate objectives you're trying to achieve and then the processes by which you will go through jointly to achieve those desired end state it often times takes sometimes several contract negotiations, get through it you can do it outside of contract negotiations where you would have signed agreements to do something that wasn't wrapped up in a traditional contracts are several approaches to doing that but that is a prime opportunity for the United States I think because it is an untapped reservoir of potential for increased performance in organizations across it's just not been down a lot you traditionally we'll start with non-union groups and office groups where you have flexibility to do test models and do different things, so the early on involvement is the key to success in designing these programs in the union environment environment I think it's fair to say a union environment is a hard place to start the change process that's one case where it almost always does have to lag OK joining us again from Vernon Hills is Marsha, so far the the panelists and to a certain extent dr. Lawler seem to be talking in terms of that struck me is most relevant for larger organizations I tend to work with smaller companies which is really Dynamic segment of the American economy these days and I have two questions that I keep hearing from CEOs on these issues one is how do you keep total pay from going out of control and skill base pay or, competition competency-based pay once the system's been in overtime do you how much of something do you need and what you have enough do you deny employees the opportunities to develop the skills that you've identified as important the other question I have that I specifically like dr. Lawler to results to respond to is, it seems to me that on the skill-based pay in the competency pay they stay here we're talking a lot about paying for potential and what I'm hearing from my clients is they don't want to do that they want to pay for results and how would you get from paying for skills to paying for actual results achieved we're going to talk about the latter question Nick so hold off on that, and I think the argument is you have to pay to get the person in the door and the person has a market value and that market value is a result of what they can do so you have to find a fit between what you can afford and what the market prices for what that person can do the second piece of course if you want them to do more and to learn more you'd better reflect that in your pay system otherwise you'll be developing somebody for somebody else's enjoyment and long-term profitability so I don't see it as a question of potential, has performance I think it's a question of combining the two and I think you made that point when we made that point as well earlier as did Paula that you've got to put the two pieces together they don't substitute for each other from but cost perspective what we've done in our competency models that we've implemented this far is we have continued to manage to a salary budget and by doing that you know some people would say well your are creating some internal competition, whatever we felt like we really did need a mechanism in place to control costs and make sure we were really recognizing the best development the other tool that we've used in our second model is the use of lump sum increases instead of annuity additions to base pay so that at the managers discretion they can determine whether or not they're going to have an actual increase to the base pay or whether it's more appropriate just to give a one-time pay amount to recognize that competency okay, I resonate with your comment about small organizations because I think often what the small what small organizations need to do is not become big organizations that you're right a lot of what we've talked about in terms of histories of elaborate job descriptions and job evaluation systems and point factors and so forth is characteristic of large organizations so small organizations never had the time or the capability to develop those they often saw it as a success experience to move to the point where they could begin to do that, I think what we're arguing is that that may be the beginning of the end now that you don't want to move up to that you want to continue a lot of the same more individualistic practices that you have when you're small but there's some real strength in it alright well let's go ahead we've got only time for one or two more questions Susan from Boston, hi my question is a little bit more philosophical in most all of the the team-based seminars I've attended there's always some time spent on skills-based pay or competency-based pay and yet in my mind that's still encouraging us to pay the individual and not the team and I was wondering if we're going to get to how can you combine those two, yes we are going to get to those two I agree it is paying the individual but it's recognizing that individuals and our culture and our society at the moment have different Market values and if you pay everybody the same and they have different levels of Competency you will lose your best people and never lose your worst people okay so you do have to recognize that there are differences in market value okay coming back to us again from Knoxville Dawn, I had I'd like to have you talk about some of your research and findings related to the emerging concept as many Enterprise at think that's linked open book management has a lot of potential for team based compensation, absolutely there's we typically as we get into the next segment on performance-based pay the issue of trust and open book and the degree to which somebody can develop a line of sight the ties their individual performance as a team member or as a part of a several teams that form a mini business or self-sufficient business Enterprise becomes critical that's the best way I think in many cases to develop a line of sight that is a motivating pay system, for individuals who are in teams and it's one way to address that issue of pay for performance in a team environment what you reward the individual the team Etc and it is a matter of trust and trying to enhance that line of sight through open book Management Open communication clear measurement and a clear tie between measures and performance okay thank you so much for your questions please use your keypad to answer the following question do you plan to, and your use of teams yes or no again do you plan to expand your use of teams yes or no, wow overwhelmingly 90% say yes so while I'm with that I'm going to turn it back over to dr. Lawler for his insights on the pay for performance impact teams and obviously we've had a lot of questions already on pay for performance issues with teams and that's not surprising it is a critical issue and one where you would expect change as you move to a team-based environment you may recognize, the graphic that's up on our monitor now is one that you have seen before reason of course is simple you have seen it before we talked already about the issue of skills or competencies whether it's paid in base pay or variable pay and the point was made I think that one way to control cost escalation with respect to paying for skills or competencies is to pay in the form of variable pay rather than in terms of base pay thus avoiding the creation of an annuity that reflects, those which may be obsolescent after a while which may not be usable by the person at some point in the future matches same logic applies I think to paying for a performance the old pay for performance model that we had paid base pay adjustments to individuals for one time performance thus creating an annuity that may or may not reflect person's current performance level so the argument pretty straightforward one is that if you want to pay, pay for performance you have to move over to the variable side that of course is particularly true in a high inflation and a low inflation environment where you don't have inflation canceling out past raises and creating large raised buzzers for you what in fact happens in a low inflation environment is you have such a small raised in virus such a small raised pool in the traditional pay system that you don't have any motivating power to deal with so you have to move to the right have to move, the variable pay side of the column that of course doesn't say what level you measure performance at that is do you measure and reward individual performance team performance business unit performance or company performance that I think is the real design challenge these are the numbers that you saw earlier in terms of the percent of the fortune 1000 companies using pay-for-performance approaches and as we said then we do see an increasing tendency for large organizations, to reward Collective performance through profit-sharing gain sharing group incentives esops and other vehicles that's not surprising because we said earlier moving to a team environment I think naturally pushes you toward Collective rewards for performance whether those even if you're just one a teeming environment versus a team based organization there's something to be said for Collective pay for performance let me, just review what we've said so far about pay for performances we talk about some different designs for pay-for-performance systems we've pointed out that importance reward importance is very much in the eyes of the individual you have to be sensitive to that that line of sight is critical people have to see a connection obviously the more people you combine the lower the line of sight, harder to see how a group of people affect performance as an indie if you as an individual see how your group affects performance then you how you might see a tie between your performance and your pay trust is critical we had the question a few minutes ago about open book Management in essence pay for performance is trust it's the belief willingness of the employee to suspend their suspicions and disbelief about the system and risk that in fact if they do something they will be rewarded for, it how do you build trust with involvement with openness finally we also know from pay for performance systems that you tend to get more of what is rewarded and less of what is not rewarded and the thick picking the right mix of things that are rewarded and things that are not rewarded is key to reinforcing teams reinforcing the right behaviors and finally a point that I like to make is that direction changing somebody's direction is easier than, changing their effort most Collective pay for performance systems and here I'm talking about profit sharing and gain sharing plans probably do more to cause people to focus on certain performance metrics and certain performance outcomes than to dramatically change the amount of effort or the might amount of time that they put into their job all this of course brings us to the issue of Performance Management and how you do that if you're going to reward performance and any level you have to be, able to do Performance Management well it may be done within the team it may be done by the supervisor it may even be done by the total organization by the CEO in which the CEO sets goals objectives provides feedback Etc but regardless of which pay-for-performance system you operate with have to be able to do Performance Management you may want to do it at several levels the figure that you see now highlights the key points and any Performance Management System it has to deal, deal with development it has to view deal with reviewing performance it has to deal with defining performance and that I would argue it has to deal with rewarding performance given the discussion that we've had so far there's the issue directly of at which level do you, manage performance the individual level the group level unit level or the total organization level all too often in my experience organizations tend to think in an either-or situation at is we got to do it at the individual level or maybe the group level or maybe the unit level or maybe the organization level I'm going to argue and I think you'll hear the panel members at times at least agree with me that it may be possible and indeed necessary in some situations to manage performance at two, two or more levels that is to create reward systems that reward individual Performance Group performance business unit performance and Corporation performance and in fact the right combination of those if well managed can produce the kind of behaviors the kind of direction that will lead to a high performance organization in fact often just rewarding one of those incorrectly directs Behavior let me just, present Continuum of thinking about rewarding individual versus team performance that we've used a lot in our research and we find quite helpful the traditional reward system usually operates at the first point on this Continuum that is it measures and rewards individual performance most organizations recognize that when they create teams this is no longer appropriate maybe they read demings work maybe they've just heard the members of their work team say wait a minute we're in competition, here when in fact we're supposed to be cooperating what they often do is move to the third point on this particular table that is they continue to reward the individuals but they measure teamwork they add to the performance appraisal system or a item which says cooperation was a team contribution to the team or they put in a peer review system that identifies who's really valuable contributor the team and who's the not so valuable to the member of the, team they then use that to drive an individual pay-for-performance, this of course is a step toward creating a more teamwork oriented culture but it still puts people in competition particularly if it's part of a merit pay system where there's a fixed budget being divided up among the people in a work team if you're not careful you can create a world in which individuals are competing to be the most Cooperative doesn't sound right to me at least and indeed if you ask people who are in that kind of environment it doesn't sound right to them, our argument is that if you really want cohesive teams you have to move down to the bottom point on this next chart that is measure and reward reward the group as a whole, do Performance Management set goals Etc at the group level and reward everybody in the group at the same level several questionnaires have already pointed out that may not go down well in the group and some groups still want to recognize the MVP and so forth and so on so you may want to go one step up on that chart and reward the group and then have an overlay of MVP award or special award but that's a very, tricky process to introduce into certain kinds of groups particularly high performance work groups because you've got a deal very well with the issue of who nominates and who identify as the most valuable player if that's a management decision particularly if it's a unilateral management decision which supervisor identifies who's the most valuable contributor you can get significant resistance and rejection of that by the members of the group I've even seeing the winner of that award whether it be cash or recognition turn it down because, they feel that they could only should only be judged and evaluated by their team members for such an award so it's a tricky point to be what one way of thinking about this Continuum is in terms of the kind of behavior you want out of the group you want a highly cohesive group highly interdependent that's focused on a single outcome that they're all responsible for then you probably do need to be down to the bottom of this list that is where you measure and reward the group equally, if you have a little more space for individual initiative you want to recognize the individual who may want to move one step up if it's a relatively Loosely connected group of people then you may operate somewhere further up this list of reward practices just measuring teamwork for example what we said let me go back and Briefly summarize it and we talking about group rewards as rewarding as a group key is how interdependent the work is the more interdependent it is the more you, want to reward the group for their total performance there is a values issue here the values of the group of the values that the individuals have about individual performance you want to pay attention to that you may have to some degree if they're strong individual values pay it to recognize that through allowing the group to reward individuals it's important I think to have peer assessment in the process of particularly if you're going to reward individuals differently customer feedback is critical, to keep this team a to any team focused on who they're servicing and then finally and several people have mentioned this already when you talk about groups and group rewards it's important to look at your measurement systems at your selection systems at your training systems at your overall Performance Management System to be sure that they're supporting the right kind of team performance often I find failures in, team performance management or really not pay system failures their information system failures improper work design failures failure to get data from the right people what when looking at Team Performance Management we find some interesting special issues emerge and that is the whole idea of Team development needs to come front and center we're used to in Performance Management thinking about individual goals and setting objectives for individuals to learn particular bodies of knowledge or, we improve their performance in a particular area what the trick and team Performance Management is to do that with teams to help them set goals and develop around being more self managing increasing their knowledge base increasing their ability to perform functions that might previously be a staff function or improve their own group process critical development issues for teams that need to be dealt with in 18 performance appraisal environment the several people mentioned and I'll just, the add to it that we find in evaluating teams it's particularly important to get data from customers from supervisors from teams that are before them in the work process and Essence to get as much performance appraisal data on them as a team as possibly can be gathered and then finally the argue we find the teams that perform best do good self-analysis they may need help in that they may need a facilitator they may need some instrumentation some questionnaires, some surveys but they need to be able to analyze their own work process as to why it's going well and why it's not generally though in terms of Performance Management the team level it's really a matter of going through many of the same steps that you go through if you're doing good Performance Management with an individual set goals you determine how you're going to measure performance you establish a rewards contract and you agree on any training that's needed to support that once you're into the performance period for the team, you need to do regular updating on how things are going give ongoing feedback perhaps change the contract if it's if that's needed because of dramatic changes in the environment and then of course at the end do a full debriefing with the team get input from whoever is relevant but particularly get input from the team get their ideas as to how they've performed that's when you need to get them to do a self-analysis self-evaluation, and get input from others complete the overall appraisal of the team in a joint way here I think is a skill that the supervisors need to develop for the team they need to be able to deal with the team as a team and that's a skill that many supervisors don't have they're used to dealing one-on-one with individuals instead of dealing in a group situation in which you collectively evaluate the performance of individuals as a total team and then, of course if there's going to be a pay action based on team performance degree on that and make it public let people know what's happened as a result of team performance let me go for a moment to the next level of performance aggregation and talk a little bit about gainsharing gainsharing is in many ways an old friend or at least a well-established practice it's been around since the 30s or 40s or earlier we had some questions about unions gainsharing is particularly interesting because it was developed by Union Leader Joe Scanlon, who had a radical idea he argued that if you wanted labor and management to cooperate you ought to give them a common goal and what better common goal is there than making more money for both parties and his rationale I think was pretty valid that if you give employees a stake in the business you agree to share gains with them they'll be more motivated to generate gains than if they don't have a stake in the business and a share of those gains his model for doing that was typically operate at the department level or the office, level or the factory level and generate a bonus paid, for bonus is paid by a formula to all employees in that location key issue in any bonus plan or any gain sharing plan is creating a fair entrusted standard that is a comparison that everybody can agree is valid to history determining when performance has actually improved second key issue relevant to measurement has to do with the comprehensiveness of the measures as we said earlier if you don't measure something it's likely to decrease, many gain sharing plans have failed because they haven't measured the full array of behavior that you need from a plant or from an office in order to be successful then of course you need timely bonuses to help establish the line of sight key interdependencies is another point in terms of what it takes to make gainsharing work that is you need to get enough collection of people together so that you're motivating the right cooperation gainsharing plans are often particularly effective in, continuous process production facilities and interdependent service facilities because they can motivate teams to work together they are nice compliment in some cases with individual team-based rewards because they deal with the issue of what happens if team a needs to work with Team be in order to make the place effective maybe we don't just want to get team a to be optimally effective and Team B to be optimally effective we want them to work together to make the total organization optimally, effective okay other points in terms of the success of gainsharing include communication about organizational performance the earlier question about open book management of course applies here involvement opportunities tends to be a clear predictor one of the interesting things about the early gain sharing plans and Joe scanlon's model for gainsharing was the use of problem-solving groups in fact many gain sharing plans Advocates argued that problem-solving groups quality circles did not start in Japan than in fact they started in Scanlon plan, bunnies where employees got together to figure out work method improvements in order to generate Improvement which would fund the bonus and indeed that's proven to be a very successful complementary system it partially answers the question that I asked earlier around why should an organization Implement a suggestion that comes out of a problem solving group the answer in terms of gainsharing is because they'll profit profit goes not just to the person who thinks of the idea and the, develops a but also to the person who implements it and adopts it finally in terms of gain sharing is a lot of evidence that they work best when everyone in the organization has a say and in fact often boats are say in the creation of the plan and votes on its actual implementation not surprisingly when we look at the results of gainsharing the first outcome that's identified in the research literature is better Teamwork because your reward everybody as a collection you create a more teamwork oriented, ation now earlier I distinguished we a team work based organization and work teams and I think the distinction is useful here gainsharing probably does not create self managing work teams and necessarily reinforce them what it does more is create a teamwork based organization you may need to do something addition if you want to create a self managing work team based organization, so gainsharing has I would argue along and quite positive history in the United States and has shown a number of quite impactful results one of the issues that often comes up with gainsharing is can you or should you combine it with other kinds of pay for performance for example profit-sharing or stock ownership the next graphic shows a model where that is not done that is here we have an organization which has profit sharing from top to the middle of the organization, ownership from top to the middle and gain sharing below that that's a particular design why would I show that design well I'm trying to illustrate the point that if the lower part of the organization particularly if a plant or a department is relatively autonomous independent of the rest of the organization seemed at that Middle Point might not be bad, on the other hand if it needs to be integrated into the rest of the organization that very seem might be quite dysfunctional the here we're back to the issue of course of structure versus pay system design what kind of seems do we want and of course the issue of the ability to produce a line of sight ownership and profit sharing when it goes all the way from the top to the bottom of an organization is likely to have poor line of sight on the other hand it might be worth doing if you want to create an overall, integrated sense of a single organization that's what this next graphic shows it shows profit sharing and ownership going from the top of the organization to the bottom as well as gain sharing so in this organization somebody down below at the lowest level would have much expanded information knowledge power and rewards about their work be part of profit sharing that be part of ownership they departed gainsharing so in that situation we should have a true teamwork environment from the top to the bottom with no, oh seems or at least no major seems as well as the opportunity for other kinds of teams let me let me just summarize them by going back to the kinds of teams that we identified at the beginning and arguing what kind of reward system practices are particularly appropriate for those types of teams we started with the problem solving team I would argue that skill base pay is helpful for problem solving teams it's probably not critical but it's helpful it's helpful because it, skill base in the organization and that allows people who come he produces people who can participate better in problem-solving activities the better overview better integrate of knowledge the organization they produce better Solutions gainsharing and profit-sharing they are also very helpful and perhaps necessary in a problem solving team environment interestingly enough the Japanese who have a form of profit-sharing always combine that with their quality circles earlier as I mentioned Scanlon are, good for combining gain sharing with problem-solving groups finally there's an argument to be said for having recognition devices that recognize the quality of the ideas I say recognition here because I think it's important not to get into Financial rewards for producing ideas producing ideas is only part of the way to improving your organization I get concerned if you reward it too heavily and with too much of a financial reward clear, or people who would disagree with me on that terms of high performance work teams think the list of prescriptions is somewhat different skill base pay particularly skill base pay that's horizontal depth and vertical area is critical to high performance work teams also I would argue team incentives are very possible here Pure Performance appraisal is very possible as the team's become more mature and more self-managing they can handle it finally gainsharing profit-sharing can also help and be calm, Elementary to high performance work teams project teams somewhat different set of issues but similar prescription skill-based pay is critical, one of the mix issues little differently the project team is often the project team you need depth knowledge more than breath Although our studies particularly the work done by Sue Mormon and Monty Mormon and Susan Collins suggest that some cross training is helpful in concurrent engineering teams perhaps the most critical thing there is having individuals with good depth knowledge key issue team Performance Management and project teams is critical if the individual who's managing the project doesn't have the ability to evaluate the team in effect the pay of, visuals you lose the focus on the project and people focus too much back on their functional home or on their other responsibilities and then finally I think it makes sense to complement teams with t of that nature with performance pay finally coordinating overlaying teams the issue again is I think skill base pay is appropriate mix is critical depending on what they're trying to coordinate or what they're laying overlaying I'm not so sure you can do as much with rewarding these kinds of, teams as teams they don't produce products they don't produce Services what they often need is help and implementing their ideas that brings us back to the idea of gainsharing profit-sharing stock ownership and perhaps hear some individual competition contribution and recognition for people who are particularly outstanding heroic type figures in these coordinating overlaying groups they're the ones I think we know the least about at this point so I'm probably least confident in my prescriptions for, how you create a team and support of reward system for this type of teams let me turn it back to everyone else now and see if I think we're about ready for a break is that weird we have one more question for you so thank you for that and we're going to go ahead and turn it back to our survey panel here's the question what do you see as the key issues facing teams a developing effective pay systems to support teams be training and development to support teams Effectiveness see providing a, appropriate organizational structures to support teams and D leadership issues again the question what do you see as the key issues facing teams a developing effective pay systems to support team be training and development to support teams Effectiveness do you providing appropriate organizational structures to support teams and D leadership issues, and the results are in it looks like just over forty percent believe that it's providing appropriate organizational structures and we're pretty evenly split among the other ones well right now we're going to take a five-minute break and Upon Our return you'll be able to hear from our panelists and once again you'll have an opportunity to call in with your questions

how it can help you we'd be pleased to have you as a member, brr,welcome back we're here with Ed Lawler Glenn Dalton Paula Maser and Wilma shop and if you have a question and you're watching from one of our interactive locations pressure read called button now if you're calling in by telephone that number is 1-800-543-8242 and we're waiting for those calls to come in just got a couple of questions Glenn I've heard a lot about the cross-functional teams you've created Ralston Purina how are these teams structured well this goes back to one of the questions actually it was asked earlier about, in this and other than the manufacturing or non-exempt area and this particular group that we work with was in our sales organization where we had the traditional sales organization our old organization was one in which the structure of their organization was traditionally you had a sales person out there was a point person with a buyer and then supporting that person was a group of traditional organizations Marketing sales Finance systems training Etc and as we look to get, closer to our customers we saw that that really didn't make sense so what we had to do was to transform the organization into a new organization in which we created cross-functional teams on the at the locations close to our customers where we'd have on a team cross-functional representatives from Marketing sales Finance training Rd systems Etc so that we could interact directly with those positions for our customers and what Ralston did in that circumstance we built a, model of a competency-based system in which there wasn't there were not only measurements and objectives set for individual performance but also team-based objective set so it was balancing that need for individuals will be rewarded as individuals as well as the team-based result those were measured in a multi-source assessment environment or 360 environment and so we had a balance of individual rewards from a competency-based competency basis as well, well as team-based awards for the group and a balance of Behavioral objectives on the competence and results that the team achieved so I think that helped to satisfy this seemingly this contradiction between having a team yet rewarding for individual Behavior so we first change the structure and then change the infrastructure to support the new objectives for that group okay now Paula I understand you have an incentive plan for your account team can you describe how that works, yes we have an incentive plan that deals with four key metrics and we can get the picture up I could help talk through that it's the one on plan metrics, one more here we go and what I want to point out here is that the actual performance in revenues and bookings is measured on a year-to-date basis each quarter against the year to take quota and this is the expected level of performance the important piece here is the waiting's weightings are established by each team to reflect the appropriate emphasis for the revenue and the bookings the teams decide what weightings to apply that will then in, packed their end results and this plan also takes into account to Target metrics and that's on customer satisfaction and the customers actually have a part in deciding this the problem resolution cycle time is determined with the customer and the to identify customer driven needs are taken from their business plan the final metric is business milestones and there are actually three identified actions and these set the targets the business Milestones serve, as an accelerator to the output of the plan and actually have to be completed in total to have any effect okay well my how have you use pay for performance at various levels within your organization well it might be until we really made a lot of progress I think with variable pay and we basically have some type of variable pay for just about everyone in Monsanto whatever level of the organization they maybe they're designed to plans are designed to run the businesses so they're different from business to, a business and they may be team or individual although at the non-management level probably the majority are team-based let's maybe just talk about it example within parts of our organization what we've done in order to allow for the differences that are required by the team's is we've set some common boundaries like what the target payout is and what the outstanding payout is and then we've let the organization's decide what the appropriate team is and what the goals are and how, the plan should be paid out if it should be team or individual this is created some consistency across the organization while still really addressing the needs of the individual business units as Ed mentioned earlier also we've also provided incentives at different levels in the organization so this is like it a gainsharing level we've also used broad incentives throughout the organization for example currently we have an incentive in place for everyone in the organization to reward for our OE achievement and, again that's a corporate goal and really to focus people on the goal probably more so than to really have them act differently so that it's important to them and from an equity perspective you bring in your benefit plan and you have major opportunity for employees to own company stocks ra 401K so I think we need to look at all these programs and conjunction to really see how we're putting our reward package together okay well it's got plenty of calls in the call Key so why don't we just move forward that, in Tulsa your question yes I was just curious about the panel's ideas on moving away from East compensation whether they ever see us totally moving away from annuity based compensation anybody wanted what's up come / I knew it I think that we are seeing a trend away from that and I think that basically the mirror, merit-based pay system is history I think when you think think about annuity it depends on what you're paying for and in that annuity As you move to person based pay their that in effect when you build an acquire skills and competencies as an individual you pay more for those on a base pay system you're paying in annuity to that individual and you look in high-skill high-knowledge areas you really are paying for in annuity and investment that person to continue to acquire and grow those skills and knowledge and, I think about an annuity that tends to be a performance-oriented or knowledge or their contribution oriented annuity as opposed to a time-oriented annuity that is you've been here for a long time and therefore you're getting more pay and so as you it may be a distinction is how you Define annuity based pay I think we are starting to see applications of pay for people who are developing higher and higher skills especially in the very technical areas Engineering Systems product development R&D and those types of areas where you, to pay for the accumulated knowledge that this person has acquired over time I'm not sure we'll ever move away from time-based pay as at least a piece of compensation price but we're certainly eroding it we're certainly moving pretty vigorously away from it may never go away completely however I would agree yeah okay it's certainly inherit and all our systems today all right well our next call comes from Alex in Portland Alex, yes this is for dr. Wyler have you ever heard about early design team is being dedicated full time for up to six months to design at a plan that's first question second portions of the pepper plant is transition paid teeming City pole and a game shade and skill base to be implemented within a little over a year to 18 months what are our plans are opportunities for success in this, that's it that's all what sounds good the issue I think you have enough time assuming that you can dedicate a fair amount of that time to the effort but it you may need some outside help and I'm not necessarily Consulting help but at least visiting some organizations that have made that transition finding out some best practices and educating yourself around what's possible and what the options, bizarre but it certainly should be a doable task of course it all a lot of it depends on what conditions you're starting with and what your situation is at Ground Zero exactly yes yes, okay we have visit outside companies we've seen the rewards that we've had outside Consultants on different aspects some that you've known and one of them that we've was in the book presented today so I think we're well on the track I would report has anybody with all four components we have been a year to 18 months does that improve our chances for success, well I would say that the real issue here is matter of the point that they had made earlier and that is what do you start your ability to devote resources what's your cultural environment for that pace of change we've got a Continuum that we use that talks about the organization's ability to engage in adapt and then Implement that change effectively so in the abstract as they can you do an 18 months I absolutely I think it can be done can you devote the resources that it takes to do it properly to design properly and then, Implement that change properly is a second question and then thoroughly is the culture of your organization receptive to that type of change in an environment where you still have to do is reach to say still got to feed the dog I mean you still have product to make you still have services to provide can you do that and continue to run your business changing wheels on the car while it's running around the Indianapolis 500 is one if it's in the shop that's one thing but when you have to put it out on the road and run it that's another another question so that it wasn't in their own environment I think one thing you didn't mention, is the current felt need for change and what the pain is in situations where there's a strong felt need for change I've seen organizations take the car in the garage stop the organization in essence restaff it restructure a tree rewarded we change the reward systems in a very short period of time and get up and running that's a high-risk strategy but if you've got enough pain and enough need for improvement that may be the best strategy a risk your strategy yet maybe doing nothing and a level of leadership is leadership committed to that pace of change in fact we did, one in less than 18 months total",0.8287849565306126,0.6252788,0.91283923
hpnh0063,"at these rates of growth have been greatest for the top two Marlboro the non-mental leader and Newport the number one Menthol in the country, finally only two companies Philip Morris and lorillard are gaining share and volume overall which is the ultimate measure of success but relative to the size of each wore large rate of growth is highest, based on these results there is no question that the commitment of everyone in lorillard has continued contributed to a very successful 1997 and given this solid foundation we will enter the coming year in a strong position to meet new challenges and working together take advantage of all the opportunities available to us for continued success thank you thank you,some things seemed Eternal some people meet the test of time some images always, make a smile some classics will always treasure with style that indoors, and products that are a part of our Lives products with staying power quality tradition for over 70 years it may be old but it's still gold, ladies and Gentlemen please welcome the group brand director for old gold and Maverick Judy Young, good morning everyone, the old gold brand has become the Hallmark of Laurel Arts tradition of providing consumers with quality products at a good value, the oldest lorillard brand has a rich and admirable history, clearly the key to old gold success for 71 years is its record of anticipating and keeping up with the times, since its repositioning as a discount brand in 1993, all gold has grown every year doubling in volume and share, this growth slowed in 1996 as competitive Brands were becoming more aggressive in response to declines in the discount segment, old goal volume was on the decline during the first quarter of 1997, several programs were added to the promotion plan for the second half of 1997 to make it much stronger, it paid off Excel data for the most recent six months shows old gold is up 5%, although ogos volume 4 1997 will fall short of last year by 5%, volume gains over the last several months indicate an opportunity for old gold to regain momentum in 1998, this opportunity is underscored when we look at some individual successes in 1997, working together the folks in six divisions beat the trends achieving double-digit growth for the brand based on year-to-date Excel data, Kansas City Missouri where old gold is flying off the shelf volume is up 10%, congratulations to build Blakeslee and the sales reps in the Kansas City division, Minneapolis showing volume gains of 12% thanks to Paul pribyl and the sales reps in the Minneapolis division, Paul there's just no disguise that can cover up the success of old gold in Minneapolis, Chicago Southwest up 13% thanks to Tom Arnold and his team in the Chicago Southwest Division where they are grabbing those cartons of old gold right out of Tom's hands, Concord New Hampshire up 15%, it's no wonder with Charlie O'Neill and the Reps in the Concord division stomping the competition nice job, Omaha up 16% and with Michael Tom Moonlighting at the old gold dancing pack it certainly no surprise and Kansas City Kansas up a whopping thirty three percent Bravo Terry Donovan and his team there's certainly no shortage of innovative ideas to drive Ogle volume and Terry's division, during the break this plaque will be presented to each of these division managers in recognition of their divisions old goal success story in 1997, congratulations on a job well done let's give these people, old gold has posted other gains in 1997 as well, let's look at individual packing performance, the king box packing is up three percent versus a year ago and filter box 100's are up 57 percent versus year ago, let's look at achievements in the area of merchandising, old goals new enhanced displays which developed to gain visibility at retail you successfully placed over 12,000 carton units and 3,000 floor display units, an old goes new Ultra and Menthol packings introduced in April are really beginning to gain momentum, yes it may be old but it's still gold, the brand that's been around for 71 years, the brand that has a Heritage and has become a tradition, we cannot say enough about the value of Heritage and tradition when we look at what consumers are buying these days, the style Joe has become a driving force in the hearts and minds of American consumers today, down aging is a trend which will continue to shape buying habits for the next 10 years and what is down aging, it's the desire to recapture parts of her fondly remembered carefree childhoods and bring them into our more complicated not so always fun adult lives, so we buy board games that we played as children collect Barbie dolls and 60s and 70s CDs, Aging in 40 plus the Rolling Stones just kicked off an international tour and tickets are off the board, Joan Collins and Paul Newman both 60 plus our cast as the sexiest of sex symbols, more than 12,000 of the runners who ran the 1997 New York Marathon were over 40, 124 of them were over 70 years old, remember how much we liked Halloween, fifty percent of Halloween costumes sales are now two adults, versus ten percent just ten years ago, Scott Benson from our market research Department confirms more than half of the increase in adults sales has been pinpointed to the folks who work at Laurel Arts corporate office, some of the hottest sellers for videos are reruns of I Love Lucy The Honeymooners The Lone Ranger and Death Valley Days, the hottest radio format is golden oldies the number of stations showcasing Elvis The Supremes The Platters and The Temptations has ballooned, at age 67 Ray Charles recently released his 5 CD set entitled genius and soul and it's flying off the shelves, as we've just seen Americans are feeling nostalgic, and tradition and feeling good are definitely in Vogue oh yeah it may be old but it's still gold and our old gold brand a quality product that has withstood the test of time, emanates tradition, and this tradition must continue in 1998, the 1998 marketing plan was engineered to keep all gold on the growth track, our marketing plan is aggressive to achieve a volume goal of 2.1 billion units an increase of 10% versus this year, our promotion plan is aggressive to meet this objective, the tier structure strategy put in place this year will continue, for 1998 the tears have been streamlined from four to three based on Excel data, tier one or more kits were all gold has a share of Market greater than 1% and discount brands have a shared development index greater than 100, they're strong all gold strong Discount Markets, tier two markets are markets were all gold has a share of less than 1% and discount Brands and STI greater than 100, underdeveloped old gold strong Discount Markets, this Market group represents an opportunity for old gold to build business, and tier 3 markets are underdeveloped for both old gold and discount brands, in all tears were increasing the coupon coverage to 80% up from the current 65% enough coupons will be produced and distributed to cover 80% of all old gold packs and cartons scheduled to be shipped during 1998, in tears 1 and 2 we're increasing the value of the coupons to focus spending in the highest opportunity markets, to your one and two markets will be supported with 30 cents and forty cents coupons on packs and three dollar 350 and four dollar carton coupons to beat the competition, tier 3 markets will be supported with a single rate 30 Cent and three dollar carton coupon, to meet the competition for high-volume carton Outlets supermarkets tax differential and Indian stores that do not accept coupons, old gold will be supported with by Dan's during January through March and July through September in all tears, to recap savings promotions will be continuous throughout 1998 in all tears and all tears will receive 80% coverage support in tears one and two will be more aggressive to continue to grow volume in Old goals strongest markets to your one, and to build business and opportunity markets tier 2, all tears will have to three-month by downs and high-volume carton classes of trade that do not accept coupons, for merchandising in 1998 the brand will continue the classic taste classic values theme throughout the first quarter we're strengthening our point-of-sale pieces during the second quarter improving the price call out by increasing the space dedicated to pricing, reducing the amount of clutter on our Channel strips and header cards, ensuring all gold POS stays up longer at retail by developing permanent pieces that are more versatile, and designing carton coupons that are more impactful, all go merchandising presence for 1998 will be much stronger with increased placements of excel displays, the expanded use of the enhanced counter display, and floor display units which include the Promotion Center and enhanced carton displays, to help keep these displays filled with promoted product we're increasing the amount of backup stock to bridge retailers until the next schedule call, the most exciting program for 1998 is still in the works and all gold continuity program that allows consumers to exchange old gold upc's for coupons good for free packs or cartons of old gold, the first objective of this program is to create awareness and excitement by establishing a point of difference a reason for competitive smokers to try and stay with all gold, the second objective is to hold on to old golf franchise smokers in a very competitive Marketplace, ol goes continuity program will be enhanced with an exciting sweepstakes offer, the grand prize has not been selected yet but it will be just as exciting as the Grand Cherokee shown here, to guarantee this program gets the attention of competitive smokers full retail as well as media support is planned, plus 3 business building ideas are being considered, first the launch of old go lights box 100s to take advantage of the industry growth in lights and box packing styles, second testing an old gold package redesign the objective is to leverage the successful elements of the current pack while giving the entire line a more family look, in other words continuity among full flavor lights ultralights and menthol, and third we're looking at a direct mail campaign aimed at rewarding both our existing consumers and those of our competitors, this is a critical point that relates to our long-term success with the old gold brand, the key to keeping our existing consumers and attracting new consumers will depend on how much added value we can deliver, product plus plus plus, our consumer database will become our most vital resource, in the 21st century companies will set up whole departments dedicated to finding ways to open dialogues with consumers and to keep them going, even the term consumers will become obsolete we will call them by name every consumer will be pinpointed targeted and corded, this is our challenge if we are going to take old gold to new heights, let's ask ourselves what we can do to earn the Loyalty of old goals consumers and then deliver, we can meet this challenge together, we have all the elements to be successful, we have the product, and the people behind the product, we have new and exciting promotions to stimulate awareness and a sales team that delivers, working together remembering old goals Heritage and tradition of quality and value we will make sure that 1998 is another turnaround year for old gold, and now it's time to move our attention",0.8674270785087725,0.63418907,0.9128387

Bruce Springsteen as kids growing up in Deal New Jersey Patty and Stephanie were the best of friends but I'm Fame and rock and roll sent them their separate ways then Stephanie began dating Patty's brother Michael a year and a half ago she fell in love with him but according to Stephanie things turned ugly one night I stood him up, and he followed me and I didn't know it the next thing I know is that I'm in his car and with his with his left hand he drove he was steering the car and it with his right hand he just punched my face like a punching bag and knocked out my front 27 stitches under my left eye and pulled out the hair in the back of my head the next day Stephanie went to the police and filed a complaint the police issued an arrest warrant against Michael and even though she got a restraining order against him he took, per Florida eventually she withdrew the restraining order and even dated him again before cutting off their relationship once and for all then Stephanie says Michael bombarded her with a steady stream of letters and phone calls from Florida declaring his love and affection very very strong Love Letters from him you know the best it's like too bad it wasn't from somebody else Stephanie says After ignoring Michaels appeals her photos were posted on the internet and in the last, last few weeks about 50 somebody's have written these sexually explicit letters more arrive each day most frightening of all the letters from men who want to come visit her Lieutenant Patrick Joyce is with the Long Branch New Jersey Police Department they investigated Stephanie's cyber photos and they say they traced the source to an internet account in Michael scalp is named it's a horribly embarrassing terrible thing that has happened to her but there is no law that deals with this specifically even if, put a law in place and you hire 5,000 more policemen are you do whatever it's virtually impossible to control each individual person in who has access to the internet no charges have been filed but according to the cops even if he did put these photos of Stephanie on the internet without her permission he's committed at worst a misdemeanor no matter how nasty that's not a crime that New Jersey officials would pursue against someone living out of state so we went to Florida and tracked him down, down near the luxury apartment his parents owned in Miami no comment okay but you know you put those pictures that you had of her you were the only one who had those pictures and they ended up on the internet you know about that you know she's got to she's got two kids put her address on the internet with your name how about it obviously wrong has occurred here she has been victimized, the remedy is a little less clear I would hope that he would smarten up or someone in his family would try to slide them up this is just a is it dead end Road this kind of behavior the original site of Stephanies nude photos is now closed but the images will continue to float forever through cyberspace as anyone who downloaded the photos can always repost them and for Stephanie the fear of what could lie ahead is the most frightening of all she doesn't know about the, I that's out there that hasn't contacted her that will just take the information off the internet and show up at the door, while there apparently isn't much that police can do in this case Stephanie is considering a civil suit against Michael still to come today on Inside Edition friend star Matt Le Blanc answer some of the questions you may have never heard asked before but first what is it in some common household appliances that investigators say resulted in fires like these, most of us think of our homes is the safest place we can be but in reality we may be surrounded by danger many of the little electrical appliances that we depend on to make life easier have the potential to be real killers in our Inside Edition investigation Matt Mahar explains why an office Goes Up in Flames with a fire man trapped inside it was a sight that I'll never forget my life the, fireman who had half of his face was black and the other half was on fire, and a couple would help rescue their son from his burning bedroom face a parent's worst nightmare they told us that there was chances they could have brain damage and we couldn't let him live being brain-damaged Amber too, so we let him go what do investigators say is the cause of these fires a toaster and a baby monitor and if you're wondering what these and other appliances could possibly have in common that so potentially deadly you might not believe it when we tell you it's plastic Plastics that are used for these products are particularly flammable tap Kennedy chairman of the National Association of Fire investigators says there's nothing really wrong with the plastic itself but it becomes potentially deadly when you rap, it around an electrical component that could malfunction or beam is used and overheat it's not tens it's hundreds or thousands of fires are caused every year from appliances with flammable plastic casings we couldn't believe that it was such a small appliance could cause such Devastation to a brick building fire investigators blame a plastic toaster for the smoldering Blaze two and a half years ago that took the life of a firefighter Don Hargraves and destroyed Christine mcburney's Lon, office in Pawtucket Rhode Island they believe the toaster overheated and caught fire this stuff melts it burns it drips down and the continues to consume over items fire investigator Michael Lane says he sees lots of fires were plastic is involved Ella prompt our strips tough fans to thermostats it's just were metal this absolutely would not have happened Christine McBurney agrees and is suing Black & Decker for the damage to her Law Firm the company wrote uh saying it's toaster was not the cause of the fire, fire and told his Black & Decker stands behind the quality and safety of all of its products which the company also says meet all Industries safety requirements to find out how flammable the plastic on most toasters can be if they malfunction in overheat we used a burn tablet which is a standard flammability test it immediately caught fire and within minutes the Flaming plastic was melting and spreading across the table electrical engineer dr. Jesse Aaron Skeen conducted the demonstration toasters of course, past used to be principally metal and to find them with these thermoplastics that burns so easily is really a surprise to me Robert holding is the president of the association of Home Appliance manufacturers and he defends the use of plastic material has to deal with a variety of safety considerations fire is one of them but not the only one safe surface temperatures are in issue sharp edges are in issue all of, of those plastic is the optimum material for youth but Inside Edition has obtained a letter indicating the consumer product safety commission is now re-evaluating the use of plastic in household appliances from space heaters to coffee makers 20 years ago we started putting these lot o matic drip coffee makers in plastic housings and 20 years ago our fire problem problem started with them but manufacturers say about five years ago they added a backup electrical safety component designed to prevent coffee makers from overheating, and catching fire in the first place since then they say the problem has gone away but again these are all mechanical devices at Mechanical Devices fail so if mechanically everything goes wrong you better fire in about two minutes depending on the coffee maker of the plants that you're dealing with when we reviewed last year's consumer product safety commission incident an accident reports we found several complaints of Hamilton Beach Proctor Silex coffee makers overheating melting and catching on fire, are so we bought a new Proctor Silex automatic drip coffee maker and had one of Kennedy's Engineers duplicate an industry-wide safety testing procedure he made it over heat by deliberately dismantling the safety device is at about 2 minutes it was smoking at 5:30 was fire and by eight minutes the coffee maker was engulfed in flames and it's not just Proctor Silex the plastic on many other leading brands of coffee makers just as flammable in a letter, Proctor Silex told us it's coffee makers have a safety system that has never to its knowledge failed but we found at least two instances the company also said that its Plastics meet industry standards remember we created the problem in our demonstration but as it shows a plastic could fuel a fire if the product malfunctions question were asking ourselves now is as is the consumer product safety commission to have we made a mistake should we have been taking away the fuel making it more fuel safe instead of, ignition safe for years the cpsc and manufacturers have been telling us to unplug our appliances when we're not using them it's just good sense and secondarily if you're using an appliance stay in the area in which is being used but if these things are so safe why can't you leave them plugged in Lifted on 24 hours a day three years ago Nathan and Jennifer Mercer's two young boys were trapped inside their bedroom when investigators say a plastic baby monitor, first into flames three year old Bradley died an 18-month old Travis underwent numerous surgeries for burns that covered nearly half of his body is there for the child safety and, he could start a fire that's not the way it's supposed to work investigators say it was a Jerry baby product Model 60 to monitor that started the fire it's been recalled but many may still be in use dr. Aaron Skeen used a burn tablet to show us how quickly the plastic encasement can burn if it malfunctions and overheats again we were testing the flammability of the plastic not the internal components of the monitor dr. Aronson has testified on behalf of the Mercer's, who are suing Jerry baby products the company has refused to talk to us but in court filings denied its product was responsible for the fire but it appears not all appliances use highly flammable Plastics take a look at these they're all Black and Decker toaster oven and an under the cabinet toaster again we ask Kennedy and Associates to remove the safety features to see what would happen if these items overheated the sides of both are plastic but even after 45 minutes of, Colonel fire plastic never burned we wanted to know why but Black & Decker wouldn't discuss it with us so why are some products made with plastics that can withstand this heat and others aren't cheaper it makes for less expensive product that would be one of the considerations the material has to be manufacturer below it has to be affordable and it has to be reliable but Pat Kennedy says the most important thing is to make them less flammable something has to be done we haven't met, made appliances fire safe in their entirety yet now one final note all of the appliances in our report carry the Underwriters Laboratory seal which for more than a century is meant that the product has passed its safety test we tried to get a comment from the underwriters lab they wouldn't respond to our request coming out the Royal who may soon be giving Diana Run for the

state North Carolina's unemployment rate has been cut, cut to the lowest ever we're building better roads better schools better jobs and a better future for North Carolina I hope you'll take a look around so we can keep a good thing going for our state you may need the umbrella tomorrow will tell you why it 11, a human being that the tobacco industry has murdered, his lungs ravaged by emphysema Louis Vickers is a slave of the oxygen tank and medicines which help him breathe your chances for a long life it's over now you're 59 now let's correct that they give to the place any kind of a how they have a place to imagine that now it's just a matter of of now how long before I catch a cold how long can I keep fighting it off, and it's all hips energy pixelated matches unable to work or even to walk very far Vickers has long tried to interest lawyers in a suit against the tobacco companies even so he has kept smoking, I try to hold myself on the very low, ultra light cigarettes and I try to hold myself at around between a half a pack of three quarters of a pack a day could you stop smoking I don't know I get up in the night and steal them I haven't added I'll give you that when they've got me in the hospital in intensive care I'll get up and slip out to go see them out the other ones I was smoking seriously when I entered the first grade to schools but the time I got to the fourth grade I was smoking like a date, always before lawyers told Vickers he stood no chance the tobacco industry had never lost such a case, then in June a jury awarded four hundred thousand dollars to the family of Rose chip aloni a smoker who had died of cancer lawyers are more willing to listen to you now that they're home we'll talk to you now before they would talk to you so today Vickers will talk to the famous and flamboyant lawyer Melvin belli in San Francisco I think, - on there isn't it well I felt worse I suppose you pooped it was your freedom of choice to smoke or not to smoke to that right I felt that way and all that's what they're going to say during the trial but I'm going to prove to you that you were addicted and you couldn't stop if you wanted to that's the big thing we've got going for us now that you poor bastards at have got this lethal commodity and you are addicted Bella agrees to take the Vickers case we're going, sue the bastards are you more willing knowledge your firm or willing and the legal profession generally tort lawyers more willing to accept these contingency cases now that you have had that there's been a victory for the point is I don't think I'm more willing guess my my zealous friends at the bar City that Bell Eyes Ears pick up at the sound of the ambulance I'm always willing to take a case yes we're more willing to take these I guess at the present time after the chip alone, no we've got to overcome the feeling the feeling that that you're killing something that's indigenous to American what makes America great your freedom of choice I want to kill myself I've got the right to jump off the building I don't think that you have I think if I can show that the people are addicted then you don't have freedom of choice you know the jury in the chip alone it case found that that the death of that woman was 80%, her own liability because she had continued to smoke some of this your own responsibility yes it is - to some of it my responsibility as well as it's theirs I don't expect them to come in here and be able to clean me up and put me back like I was when I was 3 years old but I do expect them to come in here and do something for the damage that was done up until the time that I was aware and knew that it was hurting me, people all the time cash is taking young people's lives have you heard about the Richmond quit smoking project I've heard something about the Richmond we're gonna try to eliminate smoking altogether it a campaign called kick their butts out of Richmond this predominantly black San Francisco suburb has declared war on smoking because studies show minorities particularly black, is are smoking more and dying more than whites from heart and lung disease, several studies show tobacco companies use neighborhood Billboards to Target blacks there definitely is a correlation between what children see and what they do Edith Davis of the stop smoking project cigarettes happen to be one of the things that they kind of Ford so they sort of grow for the glitzy messages the sexy messages obsessing glamour can be yours with with a menthol cigarette right the overall cancer incidence rate for blacks is increased more than twice as much, such as the rate among whites so tonight the Richmond city council is hearing a proposal to ban all outdoor tobacco advertising Jen Denton represents a billboard company we all have an opportunity to say our piece to buy advertising in this country tobacco and alcohol or illegal substances in this country people buy them people know what they're doing pretty much it's the children we'd be most concerned about we can take their money and Advocate against mokey another controversy whether cigarettes, hers are buying influence through financial support to Black institutions and politicians the issue stirs debate at Berkeley's Institute for social change we're in a climate in which many black institutions and agencies are in need of resources right so it's very hard for you as an individual institution stand up and say I'll not take that money it's Smoky money it's not dirty money so this is very clearly that if you smoke cigarettes going to kill you there is no influence, no buts about it I would agree with that all I'm saying is that you can take the money and still not smoke you can take the money and Advocate that

tobacco advertising is a package if you will that run on Moran of the industry funded tobacco Institute it there are smokers who are members of minority groups there are women, smokers there are white male smokers so each of those are part of the customer base so in that sense as part of the customer base yes there is advertising directed to those groups what position does the industry take on the dangers of secondhand smoke the industry looked very carefully at the surgeon general's report of last year the scientific evidence on secondhand smoke simply does not support contentions that it is a health hazard to, average healthy nonsmoker I think that the anti-smoking movement has reached a very critical point where smokers and people that are looking at this issue less emotionally than the very small but shrill anti-smoking movement is are going to start weighing into the debate, McDonald's presents future Olympic hopefuls Carlos Tapia romano and is innovative soccer-style what a

live from Tuesday to Tuesday I have for the last nine months this meeting is what, just keeps me at it so I'm just going to be way they see it they're not cured of their addiction they just have it under control after the meeting we talked about how close to the edge they really are we'll see your attics are you all addicts in the same way that an alcoholic is an alcoholic he may not have had a drink for 10 years but he's an alcohol right up without if I had one puff of a cigarette I would be back to probably more, of the three packs today within two weeks detention is that powerful so it does come down to one day at a time even if that one day is four years or three and a half years it's one day you can't be done and it's worth stuff yeah and it's crap that you know if you're going to put anything out there it can be done whole bunch of, perfectly normal people hooked on cigarettes to whatever degree are able to stop there is hope what I'm hoping that people have home watching this will at least get a vague feeling about, is how it works and I know there's no simple Magic Magical answer to that but give me give me some help give me a I tried to stop over and over and over again and I could stop, for short periods of time anytime I wanted to is easy to quit as how to stay quit the became that the became the issue and I couldn't do it I couldn't do it I couldn't do it I would meet up myself about it I couldn't do it the point is I came here and I didn't do it we did it I couldn't do it by myself that was the bottom line it will ruin your dues and smokers Anonymous they pass the plate just to cover expenses and each meeting ends with, prayer it's part of the smokers Anonymous Credo that prayer and meditation and the group can save them smoking War isn't about to burn out every 48 Hours 8,000 Americans start smoking this summer one Tobacco Company launched a five million dollar ad campaign telling smokers they have political and economic clout and should, use it and finally a grim reminder from surgeongeneral Coupe every year he told us the tobacco industry loses more than 300,000 of its best customers to death by smoking, I'm Dan Rather until next week that's 48 hours, for profiles in quality dealer serviced at Ford we're committed to building the highest quality American cars and trucks as a Ford dealer we want to back that up with the highest quality service in America that's why we can offer six year 60,000 mile powertrain warranty and we can back it up with lifetime service guarantees we're is determined to provide quality care as we are building Quality Cars, your Ford and lincoln-mercury dealer quality is job one, it just Sunday paper McDonald's Olympic game when the u.s. wins you win but for this u.s.

htfb0183,"the purpose is to refresh your minds of what the science is on environmental tobacco smoke and where the strengths lie and why we're in the position we're in, in order to actually look at the science and ETS we really have to look at two or two areas first of all is the chemical and physical characterization of ETS or just to answer the simple question what is ETS and then I should go into more detail on the epidemiological studies that have been interpreted in different very different ways by different people I give you the reason why we think our interpretation is the correct interpretation and is supported by the science, so the first principle on environments tobacco smoke, is that whatever people may say about environment must Mark wherever it may come from it is not the same as the smoke that comes from a cigarette that a smoker inhales environment tobacco smoke in the room is not the same being exposed to it in the room is not the same as smoking a cigarette even a very small part of the cigarette, first of all the formation of environment tobacco smoke itself is somewhat different in that it comes off both ends of the cigarette but the major component probably comes off the burning end of the cigarette and it's very heavily diluted by Far and Away the Mage Constitution comes constituent in environmental factors smoking almost any circumstance is the air in the room, secondly when it comes into the room for all sorts of different reasons it reacts with and it adds to and it is diluted Changed by all these factors in the room itself changes chemically and physically from the smoke that was originally created so no particular point in time can we ever tell you exactly what is contained in the environment tobacco smoke, I don't find myself like a smoke that's formed in this room here will be entirely different from the biomass tobacco smoke formed in another room somewhere else, and this is this this quotation actually comes from toxicologists textbook called Patty's industrial hygiene which is very widely used when there was a chapter on it environments tobacco smoke in the workplace by Domingo viado a couple of years ago and one of the things that we quite often see in the literature is people telling us that okay we'll accept that if I misspoke a smoke isn't the same as smoking a cigarette but in fact it's much worse than because it contains all these really nasty, Chuckles in it at much higher concentrations well that's a total misrepresentation of what the science actually says if you look at sidestream smoke to analyze directly off the end of the cigarette there are differences between it and mainstream smoke and some of them show higher concentrations of some substances that is not environmental tobacco smoke once it gets into the room it's vastly diluted, the aleutians have been shown to be up to 144,000 now I have never seen a figure of a comparison between science dreams broken mainstream smoke which comes up with a ratio anywhere near 144,000 so whatever the ratio may be between the two when they're actually produced and measured in the laboratory has got no relation to what the overall relationship is going to be in the room itself,so just a close-up on that section basically these are the reasons why we're environments like a smoke can't be compared to mainstream smoke to the smoke that a smoker inhales therefore any what we want to investigate what the potential effects of environmental tobacco smoke are we have to look at environmental tobacco smoke, and when they do that, the first thing is the vast majority of the research actually fails to make any valid link between environmental tobacco smoke exposure and individuals and disease of any sort, other few studies that do report it there are statistical there are design problems with them, this is we're talking about epidemiological studies here and in order to understand why there are problems with these studies you need to understand a little bit about epidemiology first of all epidemiology is an observational science it goes out into human populations and it observes differences between sub-samples of human populations, it can never prove causation, it can only indicate directions which can then lead into scientific research in laboratory medical research which my identify the actual cause, any epidemiological association however strong it may be cannot prove that there is a causal relationship, very briefly there are two basic methods of epidemiology arguably there are other forms that it takes but these are the basic forms of that as I say it's an observational science the muck by Far and Away the most common form is this form here where basically the study director will go into a group of people in a hospital who stabbed him in particular disease for example lung cancer all the people who are suffering from lung cancer for a period of time they will take they will look at certain an implicit details of them their age, age their sex where they lived and they will try and match them to people of similar age similar sex similar living quarters for example in the population who don't have that particular disease in question are normal or healthy as far as that disease is concerned then they go into each of those two groups and they compare them for the level of exposure in the 80s studies they are some detailed questionnaires but when they were exposed to ETS 30 years ago, the other form and then they actually do it they do across calculation based on that they will calculate the rate of disease in the exposed people compared to the rate of disease in the unexposed people the prospective study is actually kind of a simpler one to understand in many ways but it's much more expensive and it's a long-term what they do is they take a group of people across section of of population at a particular time zero and they follow that population through and see what diseases they come down with, now for something like lung cancer that probably means the following them through the region of 20 to 30 years so it's a long it's a hefty study and it's a very rare disease so you need to have a huge number of people in order to get sufficient number of cases coming out of it so basically what you're doing is you're looking at the exposed population compared to the unexposed population in seeing how disease develops in votes, and this is what I was just saying before had the basic calculation to come up with the final result which is usually expressed as a relative risk is that they calculate the proportion is very important is the proportion of sick people in the exposed group compared to proportion of sick people in the unexposed group and that ratio is what tells you what the association is with the exposure and the disease in question, so, very briefly I'll go through this bit more simply on this one if the happens to be 100,000 people who are exposed to the substance in question and 100,000 who will not if you have the same number of disease in both groups then there is no association between exposure and the disease or no visible one, quite simply put if you have 100,000 Exposed on one and one of those not exposed if there are more exposed than there are more disease in the exposed group than the not exposed group then you come out with a relative risk of just over wanted 1.2 in this case could go out 25th, if you have less and this does happen if you have less disease in the exposed than you would in the major group you'll get a relative risk somewhere between 01 and this will be indicative of a protective effect between the exposure and question and the disease in question, now just go back to this one this usually raises a few questions, people seem to question my ability to count, as I've just said one indicates no effect less than once as a protective Effect one to do is a weak effect and above three of the strong effect well the reason why there's nothing in between two and three is because what I've actually put down there is one or two is universally agreed by scientists buy textbooks that that is a week range relative risks it's fairly University agreed that anything above three some people would argue for five is a strong effect, in between two and three there is very definitely a gray area there are some people who would say that a relative risk of 3 is still a week risk and there are some people who would say that anything above to as a strong risk so I have deliberately left the Gap there that is a more gray area of epidemiological risk, which Camp brings us to the interpretation, if you're talking about the strength of the study and you're looking for a study for a result which is supposedly strong to help to prove your cause and if this is quite an interesting quote which comes from the actually from the National Cancer Institute sure most of you must have seen this before and at least one of the packages you receive recently this was the press release that came out after a study was published on induced abortions and breast cancer, and in the that particular study there was a relative risk reported of 1.5 I believe between induced abortions and breast cancer and obviously this was a fairly controversial area particularly the states to such an extent of the National Cancer Institute felt that they had to take a position on it and the position that they took on it were that we can't worry about this sort of figure because there's two probability that there are factors such as confounding factors but and biases which are contributing to this result, now this is exactly I mean almost word-for-word what our position is on environmental tobacco smoke, I'm not going to go into too much detail about, that the significance of the studies I can easily answer questions that people want to but there are your statistical test that done the studies to establish whether or not a relative risk comes out by chance because it's sampling errors and it there is not much contested about the actual statistical significance in the studies in question, the third point I was making about interpretation is the validity of the study, this is the key for environmental tobacco smoke and these are really the factors that you need to remember and try and understand as best as possible because it's an observational study on populations which is selected and because no selected population is either going to represent a is never going to representative representative of the population as a whole exactly and B is never going to be completely controlled in comparison to the group that you're comparing it to there are always going to be, some problems as far as comparison between these two groups concerned now I've tried to Outlook to separate these into into four basic areas but by Far and Away the most important ones far as we're concerned of the two ones here exposure measurements the methods which are used for measuring exposure to environmental tobacco smoke lead into problems of recall bias and this classification and confounding factors, now as I'm sure you're all well and truly aware by now all of the epidemiological studies so far and environmental tobacco smoke have used relied on almost entirely questionnaires asked people about what their exposure was to environmental tobacco smoke from their husband from their wife from their parents from work colleagues up to 20 or 30 years ago, none of them have actually measured environmental tobacco smoke exposure or biet some of them have taken some sort of surrogate measure of as well using biological biomarkers as coating Etc but that won't help you for long-term exposure in the past, one of the problems that that leads us to is what is recognized as recall bias which is common phenomenon epidemiological studies it's not unique to environmental tobacco smoke there have been many reports on the record by has particularly common to anything that reaches the Press that's in the papers that it's discussed that is talked about the people are aware of what happens is somebody contracts lung cancer they are looking for a reason why they contracted the lung cancer and they read in the papers and environmental factors, Polk has been reported to be linked with lung cancer they have more chance of remembering an exposure than somebody was perfectly healthy and doesn't read the papers on cancer isn't really interested in what the association wasn't doesn't remember far back or can't be bothered to remember from back there are other aspects of recall bias there's that the the non-blind questionnaire I mean somebody who actually makes ask the question who knows that this is the case or this is a control and this is very often the case can actually influence the response that comes out at me like who are you sure, you read exposed to environmental tobacco smoke a where do you think you're linked accounts came from otherwise that sort of, we have we can't prove or measure these things but it is widely recognised both by us and by the aunties that these exist the argument lies on how you quantitate it and how much it can answer the results that are seen, am I doing on time Miss classification again I'm sure you are all you've all heard this term at least a few times now basically these are the fact that some smokers for all sorts of reasons to deny the fact that they smoke in an epidemiological study where you're relying on people telling you that they are non-smokers being non-smokers if you find that there are some smokers in that group that's going to affect your results it's particularly important to remember that this own this is a this causes an upward bias of the relative risks in the, environmental tobacco smoke studies because it is a reported Association that smokers marry smokers because smokers Mary smokers there is a tendency to be more Miss classification in amongst the exposed group in a spousal study than there would be in the unexposed group in other words the so-called non-smokers who are exposed to ETS in this group are in fact have a higher percentage of active smokers in that group, the reason why this has an important effect is because as we acknowledge there is an association a risk factor association between active smoking and lung cancer and this would automatically bias the results upwards I'm not going to play too much on to this there there are several studies that have indicated to us that in epidemiological studies where you have lung cancer cases there's not always very confirmation that they are, lung cancer cases this is particularly important for lung cancer because it's an internal organ for a start secondly it's a Cancer and Cancers come in two forms primary and secondary cancers now the primary cancer is a cancer that's important for the etiology of the disease that's where the cancer was actually formed and that is where you would expect to see them up for the biological mechanism behind it the secondary tumor could form almost anywhere in the body it's a break off from the primary tumor and the circumstances in which it forms are actually dictated more by physiological processes in the body than by the etiology, cofactors themselves for example the lungs is a prime site for secondary tumors because they have a very constricted blood circulation in there and any cell that is broken off and carried around the blood circulation have a high chance of being deposited in the lungs so quite a high percentage of lunchroom has are in fact secondary tumors, misdiagnosis of disease somebody saying they have a primary lung tumor actually turning out to be a second and really does have a significant effect on the results that come out, probably again one of the most important things as far as environmental tobacco smoke studies is concerned as I said there is no way that you can do a totally controlled population comparison between groups that are exposed and groups are not exposed the ideal Epley epidemiological study would have individuals who were identical except for the exposure of the disease in question, and that's just not possible to achieve on top of that we are now aware make an increasingly aware from studies on confounding factors that being at the very least being married to a smoker is or is in its own right associated with what many people would recognize as risk factors for lung cancer heart disease unhealthy lifestyle in general this is bound to have effects on the overall results again I'd just like to reiterate on all of these or all of these subjects that I just the biases and confined by just put up here, they're not contested by the aunties they will accept that these exist and in the large part they accepted it would actually effectively reduce the relative risk what they don't accept is it would bring the relative risk down to drown 21, We Believe firmly that did that it would and one of the errors that we have seen frequently over and over again by them is that they will take each one of these on its own and say it doesn't answer the question it doesn't bring it down to one they don't add them all up all these things add up if one brings it down the next one bring it down a bit further a bit further and as you'll soon see we're talking about very small numbers here there's not much adjustment that needs to be made to bring it down to one point zero, so what are the actual actual study data itself I'm going to whiz through this one very very quickly so we're getting short of time basically we now have as far as we're aware of 40 studies that we recognize as having the rest of the those relevant data for spousal smoking 32 out of which suggests is no statistically significant result I do have all the studies here at I don't think it's really appropriate to go through and of each individual one now but that the ones these ones highlighted here are the ones that come out with a significant, result the only thing I will just because it might have difficulty in reading that I suppose it's your address read the actual figures of those that significant a 1.6 1.2 92.1 12.01 2.08 1.45 1.65 and 2.16 the point obviously being that these are all honor around the to and Below level, simile for workplace smoking that are 13 out of 15 estimates suggest that there's no increase I could do the same thing with the table there but I don't suppose this much mileage and going through that one just now, so in summary because epidemiology is susceptible to a large number of weaknesses there are huge problems with the vast majority of the studies that are published on whether huge problems with all of the studies that are published so far on everything knowledge and ETS exposure most of the studies don't suggest an association of those that do it's a very small risk and it's certainly in the area which I believe the majority of scientists toxicologists to virtually any field, and if it wasn't ETS would be looking at in a totally different light, and I think you've probably all seen these sort of conclusions hundreds of times before basically we're saying being in a room it's not the same as smoking a cigarette and at the science behind environmental tobacco smoke does not show there's a link with any particular disease, and I do, okay is that what happened,another area would you expect science cannot draw conclusion unless it went the other way other words 80% of the studies were showing an association science is not what someone would be looking for why there's different studies and it wouldn't draw conclusions with found one, you don't have the answer,the number of actual lung cancer cases need to be studying biggest what I think is here to come study at 51, aesthetic that's why you don't put too much weight on that music is here the company cited study is designed to totally different way that actually has more strength to it compared to patients despite the fact that you come up with very low biggest that's one of the weaknesses in it but because what you are actually doing to identifying all the lung cancer cases that were produced in that in the exposed group in these in the entire population we are avoiding some of the problems of selection bias and handling and comparison, I think the best representation of the power of the study of society, could you go over what the other side might say about the studies that show weak relative risk and how they say that sometimes those still need Behavior, well the major the major ones that you place the scientific basis on is that the bottle supportability arguments, those people will hopefully go on to say that there is a tendency for them to be above one, and because of this gnome association between Act of smoking and lung cancer, that's what they expect is given what we are constantly arguing about now, it just hasn't got the power to investigate now we be very conservative and saying welcome to what we've basically doing is taking the worst personal taxes and have it, and though this is a real sample and that's the reason I think it is for all explanations is this location by the American Cancer Society which is everything below discounted because there's two days to come, reach and point on their baseball with a broom,who is he, in 2001 question to be very careful if you're going to have to have to move on a break I'm going to be a Sports Talk just one I just wanted to do some people I didn't introduce properly just to make sure you know who they are texts are from our science people science and technology department research and development head Sounders Ruth you've already seen my, Bullet to the back of the room handled right so we've got lots of scientific enough today and Michael really who's our legal department damaged load, Bruce presentation I'm just going to go and the great value of that presentation is to give you confidence really that what you say has some validity that's the key thing although remind you of course you're not science fiction, and when you ask them questions is that food can you get you say it's definitely not saying that, so even when silence dis are challenged in any lives in their field they will not there is the different student causal associations of so again it's just do it wait what'd you say scientists all the time I was virtually every day of their lives also remember today's media focus and some of you may be interested to this, I'll send this to short sell some of you may have come across this on the network this was a this was something in the Press Gazette of the UK and it probably doesn't it applies differently in different countries but some interesting lines there about journalists and their interpretation and knowledge of science if you think about any journalist working for any newspaper at any time or radio or TV station if they really understood, science, wouldn't they be in science, why are they working journalism if they were really eminent in their scientific field and of course many of them are just some of the points here, however if you did go into the Washington Post as I once did and you talked to their medical correspondent two of the three medical correspondent on the Washington Post are actually may become qualified so it doesn't apply in all places all the time but they're just some interesting lines in there, already, so what I'm saying is doing some selves are questioning their ability to handle and analyzed scientific data, messages, it's already pointed this way instead of Lies, all right, counterproductive because it's true that it's wrong when you talk about it yes if you say something to regenerate the first thing that you require so you mean that smoking is a the direction of, Geo, it's smoke you're inhaling it it's just like it's just like smoking that maybe when you need to do this have some, evidence to back it up, but I'm not sure you want to walk into a drill today I'm here to talk to you back secondhand smoke and did you know it's not the same thing as smoking tail but it's not it's not your strongest point but it may be a point that you need a certain form because this route was saying what what ultimately the case falls back upon since the epidemiology so that is biological plausibility and biological plausibility is a fancy way, way of saying it's all the same stuff and this is the response to it's not that, when any wind speeds any Jones to any Town any issue you have to mix and match your messages relate them according to the counter-argument, it's not the same stuff, concern on that,yep all very familiar arguments, we need five minutes you're going to be delivering some of these messages, not very well ventilated or whatever but wouldn't stop smoking help that so although banned smoking smoking does contribute to a bad atmosphere, that's one of the lines, I haven't smoked since stopped smoking, is that we change from the change on the group at 10:45 now as opposed to 10:30, so if you want to make a little note on your agenda 10:45 to move into the round to make sure it's going to be fine",0.81285672880734,0.36650574,0.9128388

Kenneth Kaiser director of the California Department of Health Services, good evening welcome to Crossfire yes it was the Golden Age of Television Smoke Gets In Your Eyes just thinking about it it is to keep a man happy why not give your husband a carton of Philip Morris cigarettes over Wilder Hasty year old gold cigarette I just know I like the taste of camels I find them very mild for me to fulfill her and taste can satisfy stressed I'll accept that, excuse me time certainly have changed here's a TV commercial that started running today in California every day 2,000 Americans stopped smoking another 11:00 also quit actually technically they died that means that this business needs 3,000 freshmen volunteers every day so forget about all that heart disease cancer emphysema Strokes, tough we're not in this business try health, my dad is part of a campaign designed by the state of California and paid for by a tax on cigarettes smoking is out of favor to be sure but should the government be engaged in vicious personal attacks like this on Tobacco companies and should smokers be forced to pay for them Pat dr. Kenneth Kaiser out there in Sacramento the state capital let me ask you something seems to me that add that we just showed the second one is really not an ad so much telling smokers the problems with smoking with the kind of diseases they're related to, this is an attack ad on the people who run the cigarette companies as though they're some kind of evil people I mean why was this the type of thing California voted for well one we don't think it's attack as you have characterized it is a different way of conveying a message about the health hazards and also provide some additional information that we think is worthwhile for the public to know about so we don't think it's an attack as the tobacco Institute, toot may have characterized it well dr. Kaiser said it does seem to me that that is propagandistic and it is certainly an ad I mean an attack ad but look here's where the money comes from apparently you're getting the money from smokers and they're paying up to what 500 million dollars niggas 28 million gone for this ad campaign it is really an income transfer from working-class smokers to this Ad Agency you've got out there key Donna pearlstein which is really getting all the money, these ads and put them on TV now it's not at all like that the voters of California themselves voted in this measure that was supported by both smokers and non-smokers the California legislature then enacted implementing legislation that said how the money should be spent in that they specifically said the law says that we shall contract with an agency to develop a multimedia message now this, this particular advertisement and other advertisements that started to air today are only a small part of a much larger education campaign that is underway how much how much is this advertising agency getting in tax dollars from The Smokers I don't have the specific amount that either the general contractor is getting or any of the subcontractors are getting and frankly I think it's Irrelevant in the first place, we contracted to develop certain products as part of an overall education campaign and this is going to I think facilitate other aspects of that campaign and the educational message that is going out through the public schools through local Health departments through community-based organizations where the bulk of the funding that is specifically targeted for the education campaign is going okay dr. Kaiser let's bring the tobacco Institute in on this Miss Dawson first of all is the ad accurate in its assertion, Ian that cigarettes cause cancer heart disease emphysema and strokes I'd like to jump back to what Mr price was a question first and then honestly I think that the smokers and non-smokers that adults across the United States are smart enough they've heard messages before they see it on every pack for goodness sakes to doesn't even know about the dangers that have been alleged about tobacco smoking the 99% awareness rate for one thing dr. Kaiser Zone Department in their print ad says everyone knows, you have to say about smoking so we're not going to give you information is the next step that they've taken we're going to go out we're going to attack the tobacco industry and your viewers sat here and watch that ad I would be interested to know if they think that that's an informative ad or rather if that's an inflammatory portrayal of a legal industry the tobacco industry in this case I just want to find out if we're on the same Planet here does smoking caused cancer you say 99% of the people are aware of it is it true does it cause cancer doesn't cause heart attacks because it, cause Strokes the links that have been made between smoking in the diseases you just rattled off for example are statistical in nature the industry sticks by that position we think that it's up to individuals to decide whether or not it's something that they wish to engage in given that they have a full range of information why shouldn't I should go ahead dr. Kaiser let me follow up on Michaels point it seems to me valid to make the case if you're going to advertise about the dangers of smoking and lay it out there on what are very redundant dad's I'm sure about, the correlation between the number of smokers and those who get heart disease and cancer see me that would be the California voters voted for but this is really sort of a team me a Savage attack on individuals as though they are malevolent in purpose in the tobacco industry and they look like really a group of organized crime in a tad I mean how does that help a smoker by betraying men that way well why not I don't agree with that and the many individuals who were involved I think would not agree with that, that the individuals who are involved with developing this I would go back to something that was said by Miss Dawson there that we would agree that there should be full information disclosure I think part of the information that we're trying to convey is that that full disclosure instead of being the Glamorous healthy fun exciting image that the tobacco proponents of tobacco used might have people believe and is the what they advertise and promote tobacco use is far from that, bath of uses a single most preventable cause of death and disease in this country today more than 30,000 Californians every year are dying of tobacco-related diseases it's processing this state billions of dollars in health care that could go to other things if it weren't necessary to take care of all these people who have tobacco-related diseases Miss Dawson do you think these ads will encourage people to stop smoking or do you think they will be ineffective I don't think that an attack on the tobacco industry is going to make anyone quit smoking or well I don't think they're great, do you think they're going to be ineffective why are you so concerned about um word what we're talking about is offended I'm offended that the taxpayers of California voted in a proposition that was said to be going for anti-smoking funds it then went to the legislative body to divide up those funds we're talking about now 30 million dollars in paid advertising and answer question that that mr. Kyser didn't answer before the advertising agency is getting a 17 percent commission on a twenty three to twenty million dollar, advertising by so you know the kind of things I'm going to bring this up again because this is what about me it seems to me what we get here excuse me as a lot of bureaucratic racketeering as we always do it for the benefit of the smokers we're going to tax them basically 25 cents a pack which is going to bring in 500 million dollars from these people were going to help in any Zaid agencies get to put together their ad campaigns television gets the money newspapers gets the money the advertising boys get the money and the people are going to be, after the ones you're taking the money from yeah yeah people are going to be people are going to be helped because if we can prevent even a small fraction of that well over four billion dollars a year that's spent to take care of smokers who have developed heart disease cancer chronic lung disease any number of other things as a result of their tobacco use if we can save just a small fraction of that and be able to use it for other things than the taxpayers of California got a good deal mister mister, would you have said these ads were perfectly okay with you if they did not attack the tobacco industry but simply said and very scientific terms the tobacco smoking causes cancer heart disease emphysema and strokes and so on something with that be perfectly fine with you dad's had gone the route of normal anti-smoking ads providing information to encourage people to quit smoking we wouldn't be on this program and know the tobacco industry which Samuel yeah they're okay as long as they're ineffective I don't think these ads attacking the other Street after a saying I don't think that's what I'm saying at all and I can, continue to repeat what I'm saying these ads attack the industry they're not anti-smoking ads and they're not going to be a so if they were really at ease Smoky as you wouldn't mind is because you think they won't work in there in effect of the your judgment odors in the legislative body in California voted for an anti-smoking message not 30 million dollars worth of anti-tobacco messages for simply anti-smoking ads would we be doing this show we're doing our best to promote the people to stop smoking thank you God's work when we come back more on who's blowing smoke, welcome back should the state of California take the tax dollars from its smokers to propagandize those same smokers on the evil of their ways in a referendum California's voters said go right ahead but did the voters know that state bureaucrats would use the tax money to attack not smoking but the cigarette industry executives, and to put on ads like this one which some say or outright Consumer Fraud, our guests Branden Dawson director of media relations for the tobacco Institute in dr. Kenneth Kaiser who's out in Sacramento he's the director of health services for the State of California Republican appointed by the governor five years ago and he's behind the program now dr. Kaiser now this this this ad we just saw has to do with I guess what they call passive smoke that people are affected by smoke who are just in the vicinity of those who do but the idea of this woman pregnant woman blowing out the smoke her husband, Drew in it seemed to me is moving into the area of phoniness and fraud just like that first attack at attack the executives what this seems to suggest is the feeling when your part that simple heart information about the correlation between smoking and disease is no longer enough that we've got to get into the realm of propaganda well no this is not propaganda this is just a different way of conveying a message now we are using the same techniques that the tobacco, proponents have been using for many years that's just a different way of communicating a message and that we think are going to facilitate your doctor other educational efforts that are underway by local Health departments and others to get the other technical information out there you said you're using the same techniques as the Tobacco Company used but haven't you all argued that the Tobacco Company lies and deceives I mean is that your tactic now no no the techniques themselves as, or is the advertisements there's nothing wrong with that the information that the proponents of tobacco use have conveyed is incomplete it is not sufficient to inform to make aware and to educate the public we are trying to round out the image and to correct the image of what smoking is all about no there's nothing wrong with the basic techniques we're just trying to get a little bit more correct information out there now Miss Dawson the tobacco industry itself does not rely on, on perfectly sterile Bland informational techniques to communicate its communicate its message go ahead and smoke some cigarettes if you like you use imagery you use all the techniques of these ad agencies your so horrified that might get a little money they get plenty of money from you why shouldn't the anti-smoking forces use these very same marketing techniques well first of all you won't ever find a tobacco ad or a cigarette ad you won't go past a billboard that says it's okay to smoke what there are different brand advertisements for cigarettes they have over, during 50 brands on the market speaking to current consumers I think that the ignorant world are you living in the 1990 watch those and people he last running along the beach playing with beach balls puffing on cigarettes and that doesn't say it's okay to smoke there are good and the only reason there's a warning there is because the federal government requires it but let me get to the next point which is that the techniques that mr. Kaiser's agency have used as he says in his own very print ad it's more hype than hygiene this is, a campaign that is meant to to stir things up not to provide information and I think we have a very real question about whether or not what smokers need to pay 13 Grand I ask you again where are you afraid it's going to work are you afraid it's not going to work there have been anti-smoking campaigns in the United States for as long as either one of us and they're Pattinson and if you can remember if that's why 99% of the American public not only knows about the Surgeon General and other warnings about tobacco products but, but it has to do with information let me let me ring dr. Kaiser now dr. Kaiser I you know I know the voters of California voted for this 25% tax 25-cent imported by both smokers and non-smokers okay most smokers don't want their children or their grandchildren to smoke nor if they had the choice if they weren't but let me ask you this I agree with the idea of using some of the tax dollars to help people who are victims of smoking excessive, Ali and also the educational aspects of it let me tell you are my problem is and as a republican like you the it's the idea of government using tax monies to go out and propagandize citizens who have made a free choice who are intelligent who know all this information everybody knows how bad smoking can be what the threats are in yet government has brought when there I began we all know that tobacco, as one of the most addictive substances there is you can't tell me as a physician that people who are addicted to this compound are making free choices they have been sold a bill of goods they've gotten addicted and they're they're hung up on their habit go ahead Miss Dawson I think that you know we're going into an awful lot of ground here but if dr. Kaiser doesn't exactly but if it dr. Keiser doesn't recognize that for every smoker that there is in the United States there in fact is an ex-smoker, there are more than 40 million American adults who have quit smoking and 95% of those people have done it quote unquote cold turkey they decided that they don't want to be smokers anymore they put their cigarettes down they've walked away the start what about you were saying earlier that you the industry itself doesn't wants current smokers children and grandchildren to smoke absolutely where's the industry going to be in 50 years of that hassle you what you are really willing itself out of a job I think the industry hopes that the industry will not exist in 50 years is that is that your that connection, the question goes absolutely get out of there is just like a doctor there is no one in the tobacco industry that wants children and underage youth to smoke that has been a long-standing policy the tobacco industry average that they want adults the smoke scuse me dr. kossler but the industry in fact volunteered to go off television which is why we're not on the same medium that doctor Kaiser's attack ads are we volunteered to go off citing a unique appeal to children so you know that's something we're going to have some common ground there on people not wanting kids to see, smoke dr. Kaiser go ahead no I'm glad to hear that but I take it then that they would like adults to smoke I think that adults have a full range of information upon which they can make their own decisions I just thought we wanted but you're not giving America mation you're doing the attacks on the tobacco industry you don't trust the American public miss you you spend millions and hundreds of millions of dollars not trusting them trying to persuade them to smoke, Oak I don't think we're not lose sight of the fact we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that more money is spent to advertise and to promote tobacco use than any other consumer product in this country okay we cheated this Dawson out of responsible letter have that response to the minute we're also going to see a cigarette that doctors recommend, here's one more of those great old commercials recommended by eminent nose and throat specialist to patients who smoke the one cigarette proved definitely milder than any other leading brand whether you've been smoking for, or 10 months or 10 years something now this Miss Dawson you don't see doctors recommended cigarettes anymore in the advertisements the cigarette still do make Health claims they say there are more helpful than some other cigarette here's a Carlton add for example that says lest our now if it has less tired must mean the tires are bad thing of the cigarettes are bad for you well I've always thought that a logical conclusion under the Immigrant with the Federal Trade Commission the companies put that kind of information and you also see Tobacco Company ad cigarette ads that tell you that something has a, their flavor now a lot of things the different smokers prefer and look for in their cigarettes and that's why the companies spend advertising speaking to current customers everybody understand let's talk about the cars bad for you know it's saying it's about giving you a product characteristic it has in fact less tarnat International experience as well as the Federal Trade Commission and kind of going across the board all indicate the tobacco advertising doesn't cause people to smoke anymore than soap advertising causes, people to bathe it just doesn't do it dr. Kaiser isn't this a case really don't the American people have enough information really and aren't they mature enough now to make up their own minds without attack ads from the state of California about these Insidious meetings at the cigarette Easter these are not attack ads and what Miss Dawson just gave you is a bunch of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo all we're trying to do is save a few lives save a few kids from getting addicted to a deadly habit and in the process, save a few dollars that can go up to other critical areas that the state of California needs to spend money on that's always when you're entitled you're entitled are the final words that you got cut off for think that there are an awful lot of things that the state of California could be looking at spending Thirty million dollars on instead of attacking the tobacco industry and I'll leave it up to the viewers to decide if those are informational ads or whether in fact their attack ads okay Peggy we were up to him thank you very much Brandon Dawson thank you much dr. Kaiser and Pat and I will be, smoking back here in a minute or so, Pat I was amazed to hear you say you think that the government shouldn't propagandize people I thought you conservatives believe that the government should be a bully pulpit Ronald Reagan should spread moral values and so on Central art whatever it takes you know why not spend a few dollars to teach people not to smoke look I agree with you Ronald Reagan should use a bully pulpit but suppose we took tax dollars and ran a 30 million dollar ad campaign on the necessity for SDI you at the little New Republic your crab would have gone ballistic they spent far more than 30 million dollars of, my tax money promoting SDI I assure you didn't run attack ads against the people that criticized SDI with your tax dollars actually think Michael you would not believe in using tax dollars to propagandize taxpayers it's what you call propagandas things you disagree with if you agree with it it's perfectly okay if it was if it was simple information you and I wouldn't have done this show nobody uses simple information use modern marketing techniques from the left I Mike Kinsley good night for Crossfire from the right Pat Buchanan join us tomorrow night for another edition of Crossfire",0.8282112748888889,0.70054525,0.9128392

hywv0183,"I know you have a lot on your mind about the cigarette industry Philip Morris USA and all the news stories that seem to come out day after day week after week regarding the facts and the issues surrounding the cigarette controversy we try as much as we can to get out and be with you personally to talk about these facts and the situation but that's obviously difficult if not impossible, the other day Jeff Bible held a meeting in the cafeteria downstairs at 120 Park to talk to the New York employees about this situation in this tape covers that event so I'd like you to look at it I'd like you to think about what Jeff is saying understand the firm convictions that we operate on in the sense that we have that when the day is done we will prevail on all of these issues if you have any questions about anything that's in this paper, any questions that are not covered by this type please feel free to contact anybody in the organization and public affairs or corporate Affairs or in New York because we want you to understand the issues and our perspective on them, well thank you very much I'm not, trialing for Hollywood mind I have secret plans for that that's nothing to do with it at all well anyway thank you very much for being with us today and I want to start this session by a big special thank you because the past few weeks have not been an easy time for any of us but I have a feeling that in this building and in all of our facilities around the world that our spirit is strong, that we remain a very confident team of people and I want to talk to you a bit about that today our business is growing by Leaps and Bounds we will report a very strong first quarter next week and the next quarter looks equally as good so today I want to answer your questions but let me start by laying a framework for where I believe we are as I've said to you before we must never forget that despite all the noise and thunder of the last, few weeks nothing fundamental has changed first let me begin with the proposed Liggett settlement it is a sham originally the newspapers described the settlement as a crack in the dam but now everyone understands that the proposed settlement was just a tactic in a war which has nothing to do with the fundamentals of tobacco litigation it was a desperation move by Bennett LeBeau in his bid to win control of our G, and abisco second the proposed Lee good settlement does not change the litigation the strength of our position in these suits is untouched indeed we were very encouraged by last week's Hearing in the castano class action in New Orleans the investment community and even the Press agreed that the court seemed skeptical of many of the plaintiffs arguments, so it isn't out there that is showing cracks it is theirs, first let me talk about the issue of Youth smoking We Believe kids should not smoke and that Philip Morris has been a leader in the effort to keep cigarettes away from kids one of the most frustrating things about the past few weeks has been to see Liggett praised as a leader on the youth smoking issue nothing can be further from the truth our action against access program here in the United States is being implemented aggressively across the, the country and I'm very proud of this effort and you should be too it puts our money where our mouth is which is against youth smoking over the next few weeks you'll see us communicating much more on the server than fact today we have an ad running and that was our first ad and you'll see many more of them and this is not just chest-beating we're going to fight back strongly against any misperception or Distortion of our position on youth smoking, we oppose you smoking we wanted to stop period, now let me mention the affidavits about former employees which you read about a few weeks ago named as the whistle blows, our opponents handled these affidavits with real public relations skills the affidavits were given to reporters and not to us, so we were asked to comment on documents we did not have and we could not see and they would not give to us, well we quite rightly refused to do that and you may ask why well because it would be foolish we cannot be shooting back wildly on these issues we have to take the time to see exactly what the facts are so that we can respond accurately and persuasively that is smart strategy and it is also the right thing to do, we have now reviewed the statements in detail we have talked to other people involved in these issues and we will shortly cross-examine at least two of the three former employees now let me be clear we are completely confident that the affidavits not only have been misrepresented by our opponents but that they also contain errors of fact and many incorrect assertions, we'll go into this in detail after the depositions and after we've submitted our formal response to the FDA and not before but let me assure you I am confident that these statements will not undermine the fundamentals of our position which has been stated repeatedly and restated in the ad we ran three weeks ago, so let me state it yet again, we do not manipulate nicotine levels in our cigarettes to keep people smoking we do have quality control procedures to assure consistency in Our Brands and that's it, we also stand Foursquare behind former USA president and CEO Billy Campbell and reject the irresponsible charges that have been made with respect to these Congressional testimony and with regard to the so-called safer cigarette you read about the fact is that we have worked diligently on changes to our products which some in the medical community have sought we've lowered the tar we've looked at and have made several modifications relating to, all's nitrites and carbon monoxide among others indeed the process referred to by one of our so-called whistleblowers which was denied certification is actually taking place and has been for more than 20 years he's particular process for your denitrification was not brought to Market because it proved to have problems this was a practical issue and was not a legal one, so those are the facts and the facts will come out, I wish I could also tell you that we won't go through another bout like the last few weeks but I can't in fact I have to tell you to expect that there will be other tough days and weeks ahead the other side is engaging in a reckless propaganda campaign of mistruths half-truths innuendo false piety",0.8755400775000001,0.67124104,0.9128387
hzgb0039,"this is an actual cohort study it's a hariyama cohort study it's just one study but at least it it will show you the idea of what happens when you the type of estimates you get on relative risks for Trends this was a cohort study where people were actually asked in 1965 and six whether there has what, are their spouse is smoked and then they were followed for 14 years and the data were reported to see what proportion of these women got lung cancer it turned out if the nonsmoker the woman if the spouse if the husband was a nonsmoker it's a Japanese study the relative risk was standardized to 1 if the spouse was an ex-smoker or smoke less than a pack a day when the relative risk was 1.43 and if he smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day the relative risk was 1.74 these are adjusted by a, age for the white sage and so the risks are not terribly high but you wouldn't expect them to be terribly High the risk to a smoker pack a day smoker or even a 2 pack a day smoker between a pack and to Lifetime is is only about 10% is he's still only going to have a only 10% chance of dying from lung cancer and so you wouldn't expect the risks from passive smoking to to be as high next please, this is the highest highest exposure groups now these are the people who say they were exposed at the husband smoked the most I told you we had 17 studies this this slide happens to show 20 have 20 studies because we had the three studies that have been published up till midnight III out of those 20 studies even though you have low power because you're breaking up the group's every group that said the husband, I smoked the most had an increased risk in the increase isn't 20% that isn't its 80% that's the average increase in that every one of those showed increased risks again you have to look for Trends I'm not picking out just one study dr. Huber picked out the Browns and study which he thought was a very well done study I could talk about the Bronson study I could talk about a bigger study which showed those freaks, Vaughn's Trends all up and down the line the home and social and workplace I think that's one study look at the total picture next please, this is what happens when we pulled by country Greece had the highest relative risk and and that was the relative risk of about to 2.01 actually Hong Kong had 1.48 Japan 1.41 the u.s. 1.19 West near 1.17 in China .95 when you take out the studies that when you test this for Quality please up at a little Jennifer please, when you look at only the study of the highest quality instead of 30 we only had 25 most three of those were from China the the poorer quality studies and you see that the increases the overall pooled increases the same now this is pooled ever versus never okay this is the crude measure OK next please so what's the story here's the test for a fact exposed versus unexposed, 24 30 studies found an increased risk that's for that crude measure okay nine of the 30 was statistically significant if the with truly no effect in the window biases are no confounders you'd expect to see one and a half out of 35 percent one out of 20 right so you'd expect to see one and a half the fact is we're seeing nine out of 30 some people say well you should have used the two tail test if you do a two tail test you see about six to seven out of 30 it's not a hell of a lot of difference, um and in the probability of seeing six out of 30 at the two tail test level is the same as the probably very close to the probability of seeing nine out of 30 at the one tail test level test for the effect in the highest exposure group I already talked about that all 17 were statistically where were increased I talked about Trent test we're all 14 the study showed positive dose-response Trends 10 of those with statistically significant The Meta analyses we talked about pooling by country for out of, six country groupings including the US had statistically significant pooled relative risk estimates when we did the qualitative ranking all six country grouping showed an increased risk when qualitative considerations were taken into account all results are adjusted for systematic upward bias as before we even did the analysis we looked at what we could on confounding there is not a whole bunch on confounding the studies that that scene I'm sorry, We examined for home heat sources cooking with oil lung disease diet occupation and we found we felt we concluded that the consistency of results and exposure response transform numerous independent studies from eight different countries argue against the confounder now it could be that you have multiple confounders acting in different countries, but I think and so in one country you might pick out one confounder in another country you might pick out another you can even break it down by studies but I think what happens is eventually you get into the Moonbeam from my eyes Theory it's you can get killed by Moonbeams from Oz but it ain't likely okay so in conclusion we felt that environmental tobacco smoke is the human lung carcinogen we we also felt, that the fact that we saw results at a typical environmental levels, gave us more reassurance that the effect that we proposed from Act of smoking was also there at environmental tobacco smoke levels next please, so this is what we had we had supporting evidence from animal and genetic studies we had documented exposure and everyday environments we had an analysis of of the this the tobacco smoke we had we know that act of smoking causes lung cancer with no evidence of the threshold for the for cell types and then we analyze those 30 studies, is many legitimate ways as we could think about, and we concluded that it was a known carcinogen next place, we had concurring organizations but what dr. Huber said was right and I fully would agree with him in this direction I'm in this regard that some of these organizations just have their own interests at heart and I don't want to say which ones but if people have their own agenda they may not have even read our report for all I know I don't know which ones rather die, I'm not going to go on but there are concurring organizations but what I want to point out is that our own science Advisory Board the 18 independent, outside people some of whom six of them whom actually had Financial ties to the tobacco industry and one of whom was actually put on at this is on the board at the suggestion of the tobacco industry all unanimously endorsed the conclusions that are two known carcinogen next please, okay if it is a carcinogen how great a risk is it has it only translates to risk if there's exposure consider the risk is has two times exposure okay with ETS risk is found a typical environmental exposure levels we knew that because we had the the epidemiology studies which are a typical levels so we can extrapolate the risk estimate from never smoking women which is what we tested to never smoking males and former smokers, and and from spousal exposure to other sources of ETS exposure next please now these are biomarkers cotinine is a metabolite of nicotine it's probably the metabolites of the major metabolite of nicotine I think 70 to 80% of nicotine goes through the cotinine metabolic process and, this is a interactive agency study 1010 country study which measured 1369 women measured the cotinine levels in them these are all non smokers and they asked these women whether or not they were exposed to passive smoke either from work or from home people who said they weren't exposed obviously had some cotinine levels which showed exposure, people who exposed it works that they were exposed to the got a little more about 4.5 the home exposure in the home exposure alone showed the biggest jump over people who said they would not exposed in the home and work exposure showed a little bit more, okay so that's just to tell you that when we measured when we got these relative risk increases we got them from spousal smoking which can for the most part we think translate to home exposures but this other exposures which have to be dealt with and and that would be the non-home exposure one way to do that is take the ratio from home to dot dot which is 9.5 23.1, which which talks about relative cotinine levels in non-smokers exposed only at home are the ratio of 10.12 4.5 which is a people exposed both at work and at home versus people exposed only at work so that gives the relative exposure from home away from home versus other sources next please, we use the same model of the national research Council to adjust to get to go from The observed relative risk on the top row to the adjusted relative risk in the second row which would be the risk to expose group versus the risk to those with no ETS exposure and then to adjust for the risk of background people who were not exposed at home and not expose it to work but I getting exposures other I'm sorry people who are not exposed at home but are pretty getting exposure, others in other sources next place, and what we came up with was, for the u.s. we did this two ways I'm just showing the pooled relative risk from the u.s. 11 studies if I had shown what we consider to be the best study the risks would have been a bit higher but based on 11 studies we observed a 19% increase after adjusting for smoking this classification, and due to spousal smoking, if you then take the adjustment and say what's the effect of both spousal smoking and background ETS to know ETS exposure we adjusted it in the risk increase to 1.59 when you use bat one and and for those people who were not exposed at home just walking around we concluded we estimated that their risk was and was increased by, 34% you can do this another way up please, no no that's the this was a little back-of-the-envelope arithmetic but the light additional lifetime risk due to spousal smoking and background ETS is about two per thousand that's the additional risk that's not a whole bunches is risks go but Everything's Relative for background ETS alone, The increased risk is 1 in 1,000 next please so how do I summarize all this and I think this is it isn't it Jennifer, good a lot of happy faces out there we have populations of non-smokers and smokers and both are from in 1985 on the lower right-hand column we estimate that there are about a hundred and twenty seven thousand well we're not the ones that estimate this came from Office of smoking and health but their 127,000 annual deaths from lung cancer, out of those we estimated that smoke is the third row from active smoking have an additional lifetime risk of about 1 and 10 and that they have about 110,000 out of those hundred twenty seven thousand lung cancer death, non-smokers due to both background and spousal ETS first and second rows have about 3,000 of those lung cancer death, and both smokers and non-smokers, who are not I'm sorry have about accumulate about 14,000 non tobacco smoke related lung cancer death now one in 2002 and a thousand may not seem like a whole bunch certainly the Jane gravelle but but the EPA Action level for environmental has its it's somewhere between 10 to the minus 4 and 10 to the minus sixth one in Ten Thousand and One in a Million, it's not my job to tell you what the policy should be on these sides risks are whether or not this should be left to regulation law or private Enterprise it's my job to tell you what the risks are and I'm done thanks, thank you very much dr. Baird we're going to have a very brief section now in which dr. Baird dr. Hoover can ask each other questions and comment on the other others remarks and then we can leave about 15 minutes or maybe a little less than that for questions and discussions from the audience let's let dr. Hoover respond to dr. Baird remarks first and then each of them asked another the other, lead question about this issue, I guess the biggest problem I have with this is that we seem to have different rules because it's the bad guy, it's tobacco and I don't think we follow the same rules I would like to know what I'm exposed to in my environment not just from tobacco but from anything I'd like that to be measured not manipulated not guessed that but actually measured, I didn't suggest that we try to isolate each of these and try to deal with them individually I'd like to just know what's there in the measurements that are their suggest that there's very little that's not the same as nothing but it's very little and if we're going to do something about those kinds of levels and those kinds of constituents in our environment from tobacco we have to really apply the same rules across the board to other substances and that bothers me that we made, change the rules a little bit none of the epidemiologic studies measured true exposure they estimated exposure by taking a history of whether or not their mate smoked and from that use that as a surrogate for projected exposure and if their mate smoke more than that was projected as a higher exposure that may or may not be true we're finding out from, from the interim studies and we have to wait till they're finished that what people think they're exposed to and what they're actually exposed to when measured are really different things, I don't know if there's a dose-response effect I won't know that and we won't know that until the actual dose is measured it hasn't been measured it's a prop in the process of being measured and we now have the tools to make those kinds of measurements and we didn't have those in the past I meant to go back to dr. Hecht editorial we're now at a new stage of epidemiologic investigation which is called molecular, ecology and we can actually measure some of these things in people and in the environment and really correlate that well with health risks that hasn't been done for these studies that need to be done I don't accept most of the references to animal bioassay studies and if you look at these what these are our exposures to sidestream smoke that's been blown across the basically the nose with animals I've done a lot of animal inhalation work I know how difficult it is, don't question the results of those studies they're just not measuring environmental tobacco smoke residual constituents they're looking at sidestream smoke and that's very different, I think we need better studies I think I agree these are the best studies that we have available but we can get better studies we can get better Studies by knowing the exposure Levels by applying molecular epidemiology and knowing what constituents are retained and how much of them I don't think you can pull the data from all the different countries the backgrounds are so different the results are so, the one consistency to me about the different countries is that the results are inconsistent we showed the slides both show the same slides of how difference the responses are in the different countries and that tells me there's something different other than the question being asked about the population being studied, I think those are basic remarks I would have to make and I think the thing I want to emphasize most is that what most organizations that review this are calling environmental tobacco smoke is not environmental tobacco smoke it is sidestream smoke what exists in the environment what we inhale and retain as non-smokers is very different than that's what's being projected in these reports and we need to know what that is, is, oh thanks I'm I really don't have much to say hi I did want to talk about the ha tutorial and it wasn't a tutorial it was in J&C I was this week wasn't it yeah and I think what what Hector was talking about I hacked by the way is the this is Steven ha in it and he he's the fellow who came out if I'm not mistaken with the paper that talks about how nicotine is, as a precursor to to carcinogens to well-known long carcinogens if I'm not mistaken and he wrote the editorial on this paper not about that but about biomarkers of be AP which had formed a ducks in the plasma if I'm not mistaken a study by Crawford in the same jnc I paper in which dr. Crawford found that non-smokers have about 30 to 40% of the, these baap addicts which be a piece of known long carcinogens of smokers and these are non-smokers and exposed to environmental tobacco smoke and I think the purpose of his editorial if I'm not mistaken was to talk about what a significant finding this was and how we need more of those types of studies thanks we can take questions from the audience now would you please stand identify yourself and wait for the microphone and the address, your question to either dr. Hoover or dr. Baird, yes, I'd like both of you to respond to this one of the events that was mentioned as part of the recent history was the release of this additives and flavorings list by the American cigarette manufacturers I'm going to sit in the hypothesis that some of the health hazards of both active smoking and environmental smoke arise from the paralysis of the additives as opposed to tobacco and it seems like the significance of this is, that maybe you could Escape some of the health hazards by burning of hand-rolled cigarettes or cigarettes from other countries do either of you know anything about any studies that address the distinction between burning of tobacco and burning of American manufacturing cigarettes, I don't think they've been done for environmental balance I I don't know anything about the additives listed all I know they were 590 something often but whether or not they're they're safer or not as safe as the the carcinogens and and mainstream smoke I don't know why I suspect that they're probably better than the, tobacco itself but I don't know, answer your question I don't think their data that I know of we do that questions that I don't know if you're if you're interested in this and whether or not pipe tobacco are so God tobacco is it's different than than cigarette tobacco we don't have a whole bunch of studies on it font them the most recent study did did an analysis of pipe and cigar tobacco and found that they were about as potent as cigarette, smoke seem to have the same type of those response but I think that her numbers were fairly small there just weren't that many of them, Russians my name's Richard fight have a question for dr. Gerber the beginning of your talk beginning of your talk you said you were going to focus on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke and then you went on to talk entirely about lung cancer the EPA report lists a number of other effects of environmental tobacco smoke besides lung cancer and those other, X according to the EPA report occur at much higher incidence level then does lung cancer talks about 150 to 300 thousand cases of lower respiratory tract infections for example in young children and two hundred thousand to a million children that have asthma ha either more severe or more frequent because of environmental tobacco smoke can you respond to that I'll try to I've looked at that information I've given, medical Grand rounds at my institution on those subjects, I find it that those data those studies are much more difficult to sort out than is the lung cancer and it's why I primarily focused on lung cancer there's a finite number of studies and a lesser number of issues the environmental confounding factors and lifestyle Behavior factors in the development of disorders in children and development of, struct of lung disease in adults are so much more complex and so much more difficult to sort out that I can't make anything either way out of it, but if I could just follow up I mean they the numbers that the APA are citing are so much greater I mean we can argue that with lung cancer the risk is relatively small and difficult to detect with statistical methods but when you're talking about two hundred thousand to a million cases of asthma you know that should not be difficult to detect statistically I mean that should be very obvious statistically, do you feel that ETS passes to in cases of asthma he asks you yeah, I asthma is a inflammatory disease it alone I have asthma I've had anaphylactic reactions with asthma asthma is triggered by a number of things in the environment and for me tobacco smoke can be one of them it doesn't cause my asthma it exacerbates it causes my are ways to react but it doesn't cause the underlying disease I don't think, there's any credibility to consideration that ETS causes 2 million cases of asthma we did say that, right I don't know of anybody who really has said that, I'm Martha persky your EPA report does say that ETS Clauses between 8,000 and twenty-six thousand new cases of childhood asthma but you base this on you claim that it's only a risk factor and elsewhere in your report you say that the evidence is insufficient or inconclusive to say that ETS actually, does cause asthma in kids and your science Advisory board panel also said that the evidence was insufficient to say that ETS causes asthma so I'm confused as to how if the evidence is insufficient how you can say that ETS is a risk factor for induction of asthma and therefore it causes between 8,000 and twenty-six thousand cases, when the evidence is insufficient you ready believe it or not my I've heard this one before from moth about 10 times my eye I keep trying to tell you that we call it a risk factor we say that we just don't know if we don't have we don't know if this the sufficient there is we claim that there is not sufficient evidence to say that it causes cancer, has better causes asthma but the studies and the mechanistic studies which we present in the report suggests that if the other factors are present then ETS will add to the risk of developing asthma, I know that in one of those studies that you examined was it Martinez Martinez the risk completely disappeared if the mother had what was it 10 or more years of formal education therefore it seems strange to me that if if ETS really is causing asthma it would cause it, also in children whose mothers had 10 or more years of formal education, the mightiness study was the the one longitudinal study we had of at the time of people of kids who came into the clinic without asthma the parental history of smoking was taken and the a certain proportion percentage of the kids subsequently develop asthma",0.8477374595238099,0.6638283,0.91283864
hzgp0190,we do talk to the question of whether or not cigarettes or hazardous we do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous we don't accept,0.90680027,0.90680027,0.90680027
hzhh0257,"back on the record at 350 2 p.m., good afternoon mrs. Collier my name is Tricia her spell I'm an attorney representing the plaintiffs in the Tennessee State Court litigation how are you doing this afternoon very good thank you good are you familiar at all with the Tennessee litigation no not okay well before we get on the record I'm just going to make our standard objection which we've made in every deposition we've had thus far so I won't repeat all the specifics will make our standard objects with your objection excellent wonderful moving on this call your have you ever been to the state of Tennessee, yes I have okay and for business or pleasure both okay when for business when for business yes I believe I was there for a conference in Nashville and doing business in Memphis with McKesson OK and when was the conference in Nashville I have no idea okay do you know who you were working for when you attended the conference, probably Baxter okay, and when you said in Memphis was that for your time with McKesson know it was calling on McKesson I'm calling they have a warehouse there okay they had a warehouse sir and who were you employed by when you were calling on McKesson Baxter okay and your capacity as an employee of Mallinckrodt did you ever visit Tennessee yes okay and and when was that,I don't recall okay what were you doing in Tennessee visiting the McKesson Warehouse okay so you visited the McKesson warehouse and Memphis during your job at Baxter as well as your job at me at Mallinckrodt is correct okay on any other times that you visited Tennessee in Your Capacity as an employee email and cry, not that I remember okay and you've gone personally for vacation or something yes okay and which cities did you visit Memphis okay, did you get to go to the Civil Rights Museum no Graceland yes did you like it no okay a little different than people think okay and does that pretty much close out your visits to Tennessee just Memphis and Nashville yes okay have you ever been to the Appalachian region of Tennessee, possibly driven through it okay, I'm not really sure where it is okay you heard of the Smoky Mountains yes okay you know there's an area of Tennessee that's like up north east of the Smoky Mountains it's almost in Kentucky West Virginia, and I might have driven through it okay, do you know where you're going from New Jersey to St Louis okay, okay, and I go through just a couple of emails with you quickly hopefully I don't think they've been previously added as exhibit save if they have if somebody else stop me and hopefully we won't repeat it if we could mark this one as exhibit are we on 29 there's this 36 I think I have a 36 already over 37 37, here's one more for whoever, okay if you take a moment look at this email please okay, it is a big number for the document up could you please read it for sure but it's been produced in the Tennessee State litigation so I don't I don't have a bait sniper for the mdl,well I guess I'd take that big number as well just some kind of identifier sure who is it on the phone this is David Harvey from Arnold & Porter okay and you're representing whom and oh and Par okay so the Tennessee State litigation number is M NK T NS ta zero five two zero two zero six three and I have no idea if this was produced in the mdl, ma'am you've had an opportunity to review it yes I'm still reviewing the top I'm sorry that's okay, Dentistry yeah yes ma'am okay do you recognize this document, yes I do okay does it appeared to be an email that was sent on to you and Kate really from Karen Harper the top one is the bottom one started with Kate and Haley sending something to Karen Harper and me and copying me okay and then it looks like a response on the top correct from Karen okay great and so looking at this email on Kate Neely asks about the audits of Distributors stating have we ever asked them to provide, I'd written protocol for how they vet the customers that they sell to do you see where I'm at yes I do and did I read that correctly yes you did okay and then can we start making it a requirement that they provide us with written standard operating practices as to how they confirm that an account is okay do you see that yes okay and then I'm Karen Harper responds the question whether our customers monitor their customers was removed from the questionnaire by the mail and cut suspicious order monitoring team, because there is no sick actual regulatory obligation to monitor customers customers do you see right now yes okay was that your understanding of the DEA requirements I did not know the DEA requirements that's why we're requesting okay and we're you part of the decision to take that off the questionnaire no I was not okay, and were you part of the decision to not require Distributors to provide the written policies no I was not okay my only questions on that document thinking I'm okay do they go in the same, okay, Mark this next exhibit 40:38 on the definitely mess up the numbers every single time for those on the phone this is n NK T NS ta 05 20 to 176,okay you had an opportunity to read it yes I have okay and what is this email appear to be to you it's appears that we were requested to provide an average on Oxy Cotton I mean oxycodone units dispensed at the pharmacy level by state okay and it's an email from you too Michael gunning is are correct okay and it's dated for 18 2011 correct okay and do you have any reason to think you didn't receive this email, no I've no reason okay I'm and so who is Michael gunning he was the president of their general manager of the generics division okay and he do you have any specific memory of him requesting this information from you know okay and do you know why he requested it from you, I'm not sure that he did request it okay made it a been something that you just came up with to send it might have been a discussion and I decided to I could have acted proactively or it could have been at a request and from the testimony that we've received a little bit earlier it looks like sometimes you acted proactively and crunch numbers in a way we pass that on to someone is that correct correct okay I'm so looking at this email it says based on the report we get for suspicious order monitoring the lower the average, are the average Pharmacy dispensing units for the 15 mg and 30 mg combined you see where it says that yes okay and then kind of moving forward it says by any standard it appears 5,000 tablets is too low what did you mean by that, when I'm looking at this the average is well above 5,000 units so I assumed that they were probably trying to set a standard and I was saying that 5,000 stubo based on that standard okay so I'm going to back up a little bit and just make sure that I fully understand it because I'm struggling just a tiny bit okay so when you're looking at did its dispensing units is that right d is p right okay and so does that stand for tablets or bottles or what is a dispensing unit in, this, in this context I would think that it's tablets it doesn't say but I refer to tablets later on and looking at these numbers it looks like it could refer to the tablets okay and so when you're looking here this looks like it is for what is it a month for a year do you know what the time period is no I do not okay and so looking at this it looks like it's oxy 15 and oxy 30 according to your email here is that right yes okay and it's for pharmacies purchasing from, our Distributors is that right yes okay and it says I will ask if they can expand the report to include all oxy sales what other oxy sales would be included that are not included here oxy 5 mg okay is that what you're referring to that's excluded yes okay, and so by any standard it appears 5,000 tablets is too low so do you know what the goal was of this chart, action I don't recall okay and you said before I think you said something about setting standards what did you mean by that, setting standards on it says by any standard I don't know what standard they were looking for but it says in here looking at if they're looking at 5,000 and make that a benchmark that's below most of these numbers okay when you say Benchmark I guess I'm trying to figure out a benchmark for what a benchmark for sales I don't recall Target sales I have no idea I don't know if this is in relation to setting any the suspicious order monitoring Baseline to trigger part of their, thumbs because they were looking at changing how they were doing our algorithm so it could have been part of that it could have been part of sales that could have been anything okay and Michael gunning what did you typically communicate with him about was it suspicious order monitoring or sales, typically I would communicate with him about forecasting employee issues forecast employee issues okay so when you say forecast that would be sales that right yes okay so if you were sending something to Michael gunning and your position in typically you dealt with him about sales it's likely that this chart here would have to do with sales strength that's a reach that's a rich okay do you have any specific knowledge of communicating with them about suspicious order monitoring Target numbers, yes, well this relates to a suspicious order monitoring report that we received okay and so it's referring to dispensing units okay when I'm looking at sales I'm not looking at dispensing units I'm usually looking at dollars okay and unit sold to wholesalers and Distributors okay so based on that you think this is based on suspicious order monitoring levels, objection I cannot say definitively yes it is that would be drawing a conclusion and I don't know and I don't recollect okay but if you had to guess, do you think that's what it is, I would think that it might have something to do with that okay very good I'm looking at this it says on, state average right California average Florida average George average is that right yes okay and do you know if those are Pharmacy level oxy units per month section of course there's no way to tell without some context okay and it says Tennessee's average here is 14100 tablets is that correct yes okay and could you tell from that it from this chart if Tennessee was considered high or low, Trish uniform I cannot tell that because I wouldn't know what the medical needs or the population was of Tennessee so I wouldn't know that and are those things that are important for you to determine if someone's oxy numbers are high or low is population or what was the other thing you said or medical needs medical needs I wouldn't have I wouldn't have any way to know that so I couldn't use that in any decision making anyway okay that, is that something is that information you would like to know the population of a particular area fictional form it wouldn't help so I know I wouldn't need to know that okay it wouldn't help what, I'm sorry it won't help why yes yes I wouldn't help because I have no idea why the prescriptions are being dispensed or being written for so I cannot make a judgment on somebody's medical condition that I do not know and I've not seen come into a pharmacy I'm not there physically in a pharmacy so I have no idea what's going on in that region and I also have no idea is it border next to another state that they there's a higher population in at, in in that area and so there's more people coming to that Pharmacy or that area because it's a higher population it borders on other states okay and so you've just given two different examples of information that you don't know when assessing the number of oxy that are going to particular area why did you choose those two those are the first two that come to mind okay and where did you where did you develop that knowledge of things you should look for in oxime prescriptions going to a specific, yeah objection your form I didn't develop that knowledge you asked me a question and I responded to your question so with what I would think top of mind okay so you came up that information on your own you didn't have that in a discussion and like a suspicious order monitoring team meeting or any place else not that I'm aware of okay do you recall ever being in a suspicious order monitoring team meeting where factors relating to the volume of oxy prescriptions going to particular, area where discussed, we had discussions about Florida okay I do remember that discussion okay and what types of things were discussed in relation to Florida that Florida had a problem with pain clinics and it they had an implemented in the legislation to shut down the pain clinics, okay anything else that you recall that's all that's all I remember okay do you recall ever being involved in a conversation with anyone during your time at Mallinckrodt anyone mentioned that oxy from Florida we're going to Tennessee I don't remember specifically them saying any state I do remember them saying they would call up Highway 95 can I have no idea of that even goes through Tennessee or not hey could it have been Highway 75 Jackson I thought they said 95 but I don't remember okay, did you ever hear about a particular problem with oxy in West Virginia our Appalachian region, I remember seeing something about there was a problem in the coal mining town do you remember where you saw that on, I believe it was a news show okay and do you think that was during your time of employment at Mallinckrodt yes and did you do anything in response to learning that information, no, okay next time coming here, not sure if this one's I think but when I think I should clarify what did you mean by do anything in response to that information because I could have done a lot of things but did you mean did I do anything at Mallinckrodt go back to Mallinckrodt and talk to them about the show that I saw, did you do anything in response to that did watching that show or learning that information did that make you take any steps, and your personal or professional life, and my personal or professional life yes I don't recall okay so did you got to is important to clarify that point so I just want to I want to clear okay so let's kind of back up and I'll try to make sure I'm okay to you so you said you'd seen the show that a talked-about somewhere coal mining problems with Oxycontin and Oxycodone and coal mining area and coal mining town in my right on that church I don't remember about it being any specific products I remember that there was a problem, in coal mining towns with drug abuse do you remember it being opioid abuse I don't remember okay and so based on that show that you saw at the time that you were employed in Mallinckrodt did you take any steps and your job at Mallinckrodt to focus on coal mining areas, no I did not okay did you talk to Betty any anybody at Mallinckrodt about that show you saw no I did not did you send any emails no I did not did you take any steps as part of your position in the suspicious order monitoring team to monitor coal mining areas for prescription abuse attrition for my role in a suspicious order monitoring team was peripheral I was not part of the core team that established a policy here understood the government acts okay my question is did you take any steps in your role, this being even on the periphery of the suspicious order monitoring team to monitor coal mining areas for prescription abuse no okay what about in your personal life did you send anybody an email about hey I saw the show no did you have any discussions with anybody about the show not that I recall okay did you take any steps because you saw that show not that I recall okay okay so we're moving on to the next document here this one may already be an, but I'm not 100% positive so I apologize if I'm doubling up, 39, for those on the phone it's and then Katie nsta zero five two nine six one five four, do you recognize this document man, no I do not, okay I'm what is it appeared to be, it appears that the people that are core members of the Som teen this was the meeting and they were this was the agenda for the meeting okay and this would have been for the core team not for people on the periphery, I would assume so okay you didn't attend this meeting not that I recall very good moving on, okay and I think before we talked about you were involved in the indirect customer review sub-team is that correct, yes okay and what did the indirect customer review sub-team do that was the team that would we were providing additional information about chargebacks if they wanted to know how we're chargebacks run or generated okay, and you were providing that information to whom, to the suspicious order monitoring team and that would be the core focus on that coolant okay, zero kind of the number crunchers explain and things to the team that was their core part of the suspicious sort of monitoring team section 24 correct, and do you know who else was a member of the indirect customer review sub-team I don't recall okay, okay I'm gonna hand you two different documents but I will submit to you that one is an email and the other one is an attachment to the email and just so everybody knows what I'm doing here here's the email, the email is on mnk hyphen T1 underscore zero zero zero seven two five one six seven eight, yeah if we can Market separate that'd be great we're going to separately Mark the next one,which is on mnk dash T 1 underscore zero zero zero seven two five one six seven nine, if you'll take a look at the email for me please ma'am exhibit 40, this appears to be an email from Debbie Digby to care and Harper you and some other folks is that correct correct okay and the subject is forward April indirect suspicious order monitoring reports did I read that correctly yes okay and then the date it was sent on May 31st 2011 is that right correct okay and I think we already talked about who Debbie Digby was Karen Harper has been discussed who, Susan P, I believe Suzanne P was involved in charge backs okay was there a specific department for chargebacks there was a contract admin team okay contract Administration and do you know who was part of that team, Carol actually was I thought you was customer service but she was part of the contract Administration to okay do you recall anybody else was a member of that team no okay and so here it looks like all attached to the April monthly Som reports Som there which stands for suspicious order monitoring that right okay and then I'm looks like there's customer service or I'm sorry number one is customer sourcing of greater than two distributors, hours to State concentration report and three summary report by distributor compared to all products distributed one for oxy 14 Hydro a Pap did I read that correctly yes okay and if you'll turn with me then to the attachment one that's ended Bates number 1679 on the top, K and looking at the top of this it says customers sourcing oxy 15 and 34 more than two Distributors did I read that correctly right has and right here at the top you'll agree there, it says customer sourcing oxy 1530 from all Distributors you're right it does that's that is correct did you create this document no I did not I'm Kay and were you responsible for maintaining it no I was not okay did you use the information that was contained within this document to assist you with your to assist you with your job duties no I did not okay and why did you receive this information, just so I had general knowledge okay and why was it important for you to have general knowledge to form, most items that affected the customers are the products I was part of the information Trail okay and what do you mean information Trail, if there was any communication about the customers or the products so that I wouldn't be blindsided I would have that information at some point they would share that information with me I also was part of the peripheral that help them understand chargebacks and so it may have been that they need me to have knowledge of this report and case they had further questions on it but I was at that point no longer involved in doing any assistance on this level it was Debbie okay when you say assistance on this level what do you mean, running these types of reports okay Debbie was doing that yes okay and what was Debbie's position she was a senior analyst okay and so if you were forwarded these reports would you would you read them and crunch the numbers, I have no idea what I do with them if I ever did that hey do you know if someone was responsible for looking at these reports to make a determination if an order appeared suspicious, that would be suspicious order monitoring team okay and so nobody ever told you the purpose it's why you receive this report for information okay and the information that I have says you're the custodian of this report do you know why it's in your custodian file, I have no idea I don't know what they meant by that okay, do you know when Mallinckrodt began monitoring customers that sourced from more than one distributor that was stated earlier that it was after Sunrise Medical okay that didn't occur before Sunrise Medicals that correct okay not within my group that was not okay but you're familiar with how to recharge back data is that correct man, it is not my expertise but I am familiar with it yes okay so if you'll switch with me to the sorry there's no page numbers here, you can give me the line number on the left 2352 is the very bottom this one actually believe it or not says page one right here at the bits as page 1 yep right there here okay do you see where I'm at yes okay so I will represent to you that we've sorted this this database that we've received this spreadsheet by Tennessee so I will let you know that this has been sorted by Tennessee okay okay, so looking at this I just want to go through and look at some of the numbers here for Tennessee to see if I can understand it and if we you could go with me please, okay so the first one on this spreadsheet appears to be Lowe's drug in Maryville Tennessee is that correct, yes okay and it has a zip code there and it says that it's sold via parent customer named Cardinal Health would that be the distributor yes okay and then it says gross sales 19900 34.4 you know if that's meant to be dollars or units, that's dollars that's dollars okay and then it says disp units I'm guessing that's dispensing units 62,000 do you know what the dispensing units are here that would be tablets tablets okay and do you happen to know the population of Maryville Tennessee, I have no clue okay and then looking at the next one Food City in Knoxville Tennessee DBS trading that's Masters Pharmaceuticals and then grow sales there is 8000 68 and then dispensing units 40,000 is that correct correct okay and so I guess I want to make sure I really understand the chargeback data gross sales is that how much money Mallinckrodt gets after the charge back, that is the sale yes after the charge back but not including any rebates peas discounts and allowances okay okay so then if you'll go with me to the third one that's labeled 225 rigs drugs and LaFollette Tennessee Cardinal Health ten thousand eight hundred fifty five dollars and 84 cents and 38,000 dispatch units dispensing units did I read that correctly, okay do you know what the population is of LaFollette Tennessee no okay and do you know if someone was responsible for looking at the population of these various locations direction of flow I don't know anybody that would do that don't have time to do that okay was that anything that was ever discussed in a suspicious order monitoring team meeting when you were present and that was I was not what I was present okay did you ever hear of anybody talking, about hey maybe we should be looking at, different population numbers for where pills are going to actually not that I'm aware of, at any point in your time at mail and crowd were you trained to recognize various signs of diversion the only thing that we were made aware of is that if there were unusually large orders or peculiar orders okay and how can you tell if something's an unusually large order according to your training, from what I wouldn't have visibility to the orders so I wouldn't know if something was an unusually large order or suspicious is a peculiar only because we use the word peculiar today but it would be if something was they were ordering too frequently too often compared to what they usually did they ordering too much they ordering not to the levels that they said they used to purchase okay and that wasn't within the purview of your responsibility to look for, those things correct okay, okay, did they were you taught while you were a Mallinckrodt of any other potential signs of diversion other than frequency I think you'd said and volume Church uniform, it wasn't in my jobs they didn't need to teach me that okay and I guess I would have expected perhaps there would have been some discussion of signs of diversion at the suspicious order monitoring team meetings did that not occur I don't recall everything that was discussed in the meeting so I'm sure there was some discussion otherwise I wouldn't have recalled two items okay do you recall anybody on talking about potential signs of diversion being a percentage of cash sales, no I don't recall that okay what about on a concentration of pharmacies in a particular area that are all high prescribing oxy pharmacies anybody ever discussed that we wouldn't have that information or we have information about cash sales okay and when you say we wouldn't have that information who do you mean by we the marketing team the marketing team okay but somebody else in Mallinckrodt me have that information I have no idea okay I don't know how they would, get it, okay, can't going back to our chart here, okay so I think the last one we talked about was the one in La Follette that's Riggs then it 334 we have rip at 0 Inc in Morristown Tennessee and there it says sold the apparent customer number and mirror Source Bergen Health eleven thousand one hundred forty-four point for dispensing units 31200 do you see where I'm at yes okay and so that would be gross sales 10,000 $855 84 cents and, the units are 38,000 is that correct correct okay and do you know what the population Morristown Tennessee is I've no idea okay are you know what the population of st. Louis is so okay, okay well Mark the next exhibit 42, this is Bates number MN K T1 underscore zero zero zero seven two five one six eight zero, okay so I'll take a look at this document for me please, if I didn't know you guys do you recognize this document no I do not okay do you think you've ever seen it before I may have okay do you know if you were involved in creating it, I doubt that I was involved creating it okay do you think we're at you had input into the chart at all, possibly someone on my team might have had it okay and this chart is labeled State concentrations actually 15 and 30 April 2011 is that correct, yes okay and so with this chart with this show that on Mallinckrodt was monitoring the percentage of each distributor shipments going to the various States is that right captioning form, at this particular on this particular report yes okay and say included within that question is Mallinckrodt was monitoring the percentage of each Distributors shipments going to Tennessee at least in April of 2011 according to this chart is that correct correct okay and how was this document used by the indirect customer review team if it all, I'm not sure okay, do you know if now I'm crowd was seeking to reduce the concentration of Oxycodone in Florida, yes okay, do you know if Mallinckrodt was seeking to reduce the concentration of Oxycodone in Tennessee, I do not remember that being a topic of discussion okay other than format to recall any other states being a topic of discussion for the target of the reduction of Oxycodone concentration by state, I don't recall that, okay and in this chart do you know if population was considered at all, most likely not because we would know the population you wouldn't know the population of the state yeah at any given time, no one is 42 43, for those on the phone it's MN K Dash T 1 underscore 000 725 1681, the type is very small so you my apologies for that,okay just so is this the what I've had to do is the the similar type of chart estate concentration chart, yes and so looking at the title here it says State concentration Hydro a Pap April 2010 data did I read that correctly yes okay and hydro a Pap is what it's scheduled to payment schedule 3 pain medication at this time okay and so Hydro a tap is that also hydrocodone yes okay and so looking at this chart is this a chart that you would have had in put in, creating or maintaining I would not have created this I might have had input but I not sure I did okay because this was taken over by suspicious order monitoring okay but you were in play by now and cried in April 2010 yes I worked up high and on if you'll take a look with me here, do you know if this chart is created using chargeback data, I would assume so okay and so looking at this on chart here if you go down with me to the line for Tennessee which is 51, yes okay and then you see the various percentages you know it's kind of hard to line up what are the do you know what the percentages are indicating, my I don't know I'd have to look at this more carefully because I'm not sure okay but the percentages are indicating something regarding each one of these Distributors is that correct direction, yes it's broken out by Distributors that right yes okay and so you have it broken down by state and you have it broken down by distributor in dealing with Hydro a Pap in April 2010 is that correct correct it says based on units is that right, yes okay and so if you look with me at Tennessee I want you to go over to McKesson, if you look at Tennessee and McKesson this itty-bitty little line says 10.7% you see where I'm at I don't see a 10 point 7, on my see McKesson KZ McKesson oh I see it now I'm sorry I was on the wrong line do you see it yes okay do you know what that 10.7 represents for McKesson no I do not because I don't know what the percentages represent I'm sorry who objected and who are you your for McKesson okay but I don't think you cross noticed this deposition so I'm going to abduct your objection okay I'm you're not a party in our case, okay so I'm 10.7 so do you know what that is in relation to McKesson with a 10 point 7 represents no because I don't know what the percentages represent OK on OK, could it be that that's 10.7% of mckesson's hydrocodone a Pap of April 2010 going to the state of Tennessee actually that would ask me to guess and I would make the Assumption you do not want me guessing Okay but I would like to have your gas because I think it's probably more educated than mine in this in this manner I've never seen these charts before so can you guess what you think that these I'm just trying to understand what it is, fraction form, okay give me a minute I'll calculate what these percentages add up to great and I might be able to come up with something I might be able to shortcut for you a little bit if you look all the way at the bottom it has a grand total, it looks like the bottom of everyone is totaled up to 100% do you see yes okay so if you look at McKesson and you look at Tennessee, if you add all those APPA gets to 100% so I'm looking at this and saying, is it that McKesson is ten point seven percent of their sales of hydro a Pap in April 2010 we're in Tennessee based on this chart objective, that seems to be the case, okay thank you okay, you know anything specifically I'm going to back up strike that do you know anything about this they all have male and crop products to the VA section, no I don't recall okay were you ever involved in sales of mail and crop products to the VA no I didn't have anything to do with sales okay when I say VA I mean Veterans Administration you understand that yes I understood the okay do you know who would have been the person in charge of selling on Mound crop products to the VA yes Rich mckendrick okay and do you know if I'm rich mckendrick is still in, Floyd by Mallinckrodt no he is not okay do you know where he if he is employed now I don't know okay, and do you know if they've retired, I don't know okay, are you in touch with mr. mckendrick, probably if I was I wouldn't know what he was doing okay no okay very good okay,if you give me just one second think I'm almost finished,were you involved at all in creating a list of the 150 top pharmacies for Mallinckrodt, I don't know what you're talking about so I'd need to see what you're discussing okay, not sure if we have, may this one an exhibit or not yet 44, thank you, for those on the phone this is mnk underscore T nsta 0509 8003, so title this document is top 150 pharmacies oxy 30 mg only 2009 to 2011 data combined at a read that correctly yes okay and do you create this document I did not pay did you have any input in this document I did not okay this document is in your custodian file have you seen this document before, I do not remember seeing this okay we are listed as a custodian for it so do you know who would have been the person who created this document, I'm not sure where this came from so no okay do you know if there was routinely a list of top hundred fifty pharmacies that was kept no I don't know that either okay if it was outside my area I wouldn't know if somebody was doing this on a regular basis and what does it mean that it's in my custodian there maybe I should have your lawyer explained that to you, it simply means that that it was identified as being in your email or electronic files but not necessarily generated by me exactly right okay but you've potentially seen this email before this was before posture possibly okay and do you know what this was used for in Your Capacity and Malachi I do not remember the document so I would not remember what was used for okay, are you disputing that you've ever received this document no okay I just don't recall it okay, okay, k, 45,if you look at the first page do you recognize this document, I recognize it as being a an email from Lisa car Daddy to me yes okay and is it dated on August 30th 2011 yes okay and in the email and says ginger has requested I've looked at the past six months compared to the prior six months of oxy sales by state did I read that correctly yes do you recall asking Lisa to do this project I don't recall asking to do it now okay but she's clearly responding to something right, right okay and so I'm looking at that it looks like if you look at the charts that are attached here the next couple, there are various charts that are broken down by state is that correct yes okay it has to do with prior six months and past six months and the percentage of change for oxy sales is that right yes okay and save at least as a on the date of this email during this time Mallinckrodt was looking at the percentage change of oxy sales state-by-state is that right, maybe not state-by-state the data were pulled that does not mean that's what we were you doing I don't think I understand your answer I'll back up okay okay yes the question a different way than sure okay so looking at this it's actually it says, attachments are sales by state August 30th 2011 is that right yes okay and then ginger as requested I've looked at the past six months compared to the prior six months of oxy sales by state correctly okay and so looking at these charts it was looking at oxy sales by state is that right, yes okay so it's in the chart okay and so in the charts seem to measure prior six months past six months and then column F says percentage change I'm on the page ahead of you this one, yes okay and so my question is actually pretty simple so as of the date this email was sent on August 30th 2011 Mallinckrodt monitored oxy sales by state we pulled data by state I wouldn't say we Nestle monitor it because Lisa if she referred to this she wasn't looking at many states she would looking at Ohio California New York and Florida which were flagged for Som, okay so then I will back that up I will rephrase my question so you as of August 2011 when these charts were sent to you from Lisa and Mallinckrodt had the capability of monitoring oxy sales by state action of form what's the objection big it's important with monitoring capability, do you understand what capability means man the ability okay and do you understand what monitoring means, well it could mean any number of things in the context of Suspicion horror monitoring or where we monitoring those sales which we were not okay at my question wasn't were you that was my question before and you said you only knew your monitoring some right so my question now is did you have to Mallinckrodt have the capability which we've determined to understand what capability means did Mallinckrodt have the capability of monitoring let's use a different word tracking sales of oxy bye, State what is the objection compound, okay well back up and ask it again I'm going to ask it and smaller parts so we don't get a compound objection okay looking at this chart Mallinckrodt here according to this chart was monitoring sales I won't say monitoring tracking sales by state is that correct section to form okay I'm gonna back up one more time do you want to just try that question again it was because your stuff in the middle you're objecting because I stopped in the middle because it became, we're what the question was okay I think will be really clear this time as of the date that this email was sent to you August 30th 2011 Mallinckrodt was capable of tracking oxy sales by state is that correct Mallinckrodt was capable of running a report by state yes okay do you not understand what I say what I mean when I say tracking, tracking to me would indicate it could be any number of things of what you're asking okay so you don't understand the term monitoring because it can mean a lot of things and tracking seems like it means a lot of things so I just want to know according to this chart there's 50 States on this chart correct correct and also the Virgin Islands it appears in Puerto Rico guys okay so looking at this the data is broken down by state is that correct correct okay and the percentage change of oxy sales, is broken down per state is that correct yes okay and this information could have been pulled every month Mallinckrodt wanted to pull it as of August 2011 is that correct yes okay okay take a break, we're going off the Record at 4:50 p.m. we are back on the record of 4:58 p.m., missed call you just a few follow-up questions if you could look back at exhibit 45 the document you were just looking at with miss her svelte yes, the email, I question the the final sentence of the first paragraph says the other states that are increasing our highlighted Ohio California and New York which are the same states that Som highlighted do you know what Ms car daddy meant when she said those were the same states that Som highlighted, I'm not clear beds possible that there was a discussion during in Som meeting about those particular States okay was Miss card any part of the Som committee or subcommittee, she was part of pulling data for the meetings for some of the meetings early on she was the one that helped with some of the analytics around with Nate Neely okay and you've testified about an indirect purchaser subcommittee of the Som committee who else was on that subcommittee can you recall I don't remember I don't remember anyone at all, no I don't remember who was in that it would have been people like the Carol that was mentioned because she was in a chargeback contracted man admin team is she would have known about chargebacks okay you recall there being a time when the Som function was moved to a group known as CDI G section, I don't remember what CD IG stood for I thought that was acronym for sales reporting okay so you're not familiar with CDI G as a function at Mallinckrodt no I don't remember it I know that there was CD IG was used in some of the memos but I don't know what it stood for okay okay I just have a couple more questions where in some some documents,number 46, thank you, exhibit 46 is a multi-page email thread beginning in Bates MN K T1 4036 8477 and it's a several page document my only question for your concerns your email to Ms lundergan on February 9th the very top being on the first page okay,in your email for the email thread concerns resuming shipments to key Source correct correct and this is in February of 2011, on February 8th Ms lundergan asks you if you agree with the resumption and you say yes Karen Harper said we can ship all of our approved Distributors because they perform the Audits and the Distributors complied with our requests we are cutting off the suspicious pharmacies what did you mean by that when you said we are cutting off the suspicious pharmacies that probably refers to where we had pharmacies are ordering from more than one distributor, her and we were uncomfortable with them buying from multiple Distributors and so we wouldn't allow chargebacks anymore so basically we didn't cut off the pharmacies we cut off the payment mechanism for the wholesaler or distributor get their money back okay, and when you said they perform the Audits and the Distributors comply with that request who is that they referring to in that sentence Karen Harper in the Som T okay, okay you can put that aside, thank you exhibit 48 is a multi-page document beginning at Bates MN K T1 40's 27 3249 and appears to be a spreadsheet that compiles information concerning oxy 15 and 30 gross sales in January 2011 timeframe do you recognize, this document, I recognize the content okay is it a document that you had involvement in preparing not that I recollect okay or anyone on your team someone on my team might have done this okay do you know the purpose of compiling this data back in early 2011, just understand this might have been part of removing it from their VIP programs and understand what each of the wholesalers were purchasing okay, and the column A and first page sold via parent customer name what does that phrase mean parent customer name in this context that's our customer that we sold to so it pulls the someone pulled the chargeback data by who it was shipped through, okay you can set that aside, thanks, 38,how to correct the prior document was a good 47 this is exhibit 48 which is a document produced native under Bates MN K T1 40's 557 439 if you can take 0 is appears to be in October 2010 compilation of information regarding oxy 15 and 30 sales, do you recognize this document I recognize the content yes okay and again similar to the exhibit 47 we just looked at is this data that you were someone on your team participated in compiling, it appears that would be okay and again any insight into the reason for the compilation of this data, I'm not sure why we were running this date on a regular basis but it was to understand who was selling most of our product, okay okay I have no further questions thank you thank you thank you, I know questions",0.8465634127074234,0.3487141,0.9128392

jfhb0039,"they always did before this is an implant Barbara you have the most creative crushed you consider no no it's not well this cigarette butt have an impact on your lungs as they say the others does in terms of of cancer well again we I think we all recognize that cigarette smoking carries with it some level of risk and if by does this have, any impact you mean does it have no risk we can't say that okay all right but I think what we can say is that with this cigarette you're going to see some things and how its constructed and everything we're going to come back and I think you're going to want to ask that question again and take a look at it after you have a chance to see some of our materials yeah how do you know when your cigarette that's another one of the most common questions that people ask because that is kind of a confusing thing to think about but there are a couple of signals, you'll get used to after you smoke a few eclipses what happens is it's designed to last about six to seven minutes which is about the length of a standard king-size cigarette when you start to get done with an eclipse you'll notice that you start getting less smoke and that smoked taste weaker those are signals that your Clips is about done and it'll go out and you wouldn't want to relight it at that point because you've extracted all the flavor from the cigarette and you put them out like a regular cigarette you know what will happen Paul if you have just let one up, and taking a couple of Puffs and then walk away from it okay well these cigarettes also come in different strengths and different sizes Eclipse will come in four Styles May it's going to become in both day an eclipse in an eclipse miles non-mental as well as mental still have this is it going to start selling them in terms of terms of tar and nicotine questions that's a good one I think maybe before we do that to be good idea to show them what's in the slow, okay no yeah yeah yeah put it out and Yeah it later the way it works is if you just live in eclipse and you taken a couple of pops and you lay it down and walk away from it it'll probably go out within about a minute and then when you came back you could relight it and finish smoking it however if your towards the end of it and you walk away is probably going to cool down and go out and finish itself and so you wouldn't want to relight it again at that point because all the flavor would be gone it really depends on where you are in Smoke, making it but by looking at it you don't know whether or not it's it's a newer or if it's used up okay I know for a fact anytime you start a fire or your lighting something it produces a ash a resin where's the residence going in terms of the tobacco the, what's actually the again the way that it is working is heating rather than burning so that when you light the tip what happens is the tip gets very high and it creates the heat as going to said that makes the full flavored smoke come out of the tobacco rather than burning it okay it's that's a great analogy that's outstanding it is it's cooking it rather than burning it yes that cigarette and smoke it to the end and then I ripped it apart what would I see, you're going to find out what you're going to see after after you smoke one of them but let's guess what are you going to see inside I have I have Barbara thinks she's gonna see ashes no you're not tobacco is it doesn't burn it okay I think you're going to see ashes ashes we have some Bennett going on here I guess it's just some tobacco we had a question, in about tar and nicotine and let's let's talk about that for a moment most full flavor brands have anywhere between 14 and 20 milligrams of char now white cigarettes have less than that anywhere between 7 and 13 milligrams with ultra light cigarettes having even less than that usually between 1 and 6 mg now Eclipse has only three milligrams of tar and Eclipse miles has only one milligram of tar now many of you may be familiar with the methods that they use to measure tar are used in cigarettes that burned too, go and as Melinda mentioned that when you do that glycerin is included as tar now because he Clips primarily Heats rather than burns the tobacco there was virtually no tar from burning tobacco dissipation I noticed it had like a filter like fabric around that as am I correct right absolutely yep the question that's being asked is on the tip of the cigarette, noticed a heat barrier in the question is what is that heat barrier now that heat barrier is made out of something called spun glass and because it does not burn it does not add anything to the smoke that isn't there already but what it does do is that it insulates the high Purity carbon tip which is what makes it a lot less likely to start a fire because it stops it from burning back, what do you have a problem with that talk to me about that getting around that filter like stuff but isn't it nylon or you what you said it's what is she doing glass well how is that that therefore I helped us fund spun glass at me again because you are not burning it it is not adding anything to the smoke that isn't there another cigarettes anywhere is it now I think as I think it's great, Hanson do my personal come off the tip well you see that little piece right there maybe the up I got that one to come on I think that's a little bit Yeah doctors have to say about this as far as comparing the cigarettes to this product for Consumer would this be better for the person yeah I think that's an excellent question let's let's let's talk about that again back to other cigarettes I think we all acknowledge that smoking carries with it some, risks and if the question is or by that you mean is this without any risk I can't say that but I think what we can do is say that because this primarily Heats rather than burns the tobacco I think Common Sense would tell you that it carries with it no worse risk than other cigarettes and May in fact carry less now scientists have been looking at cigarettes and smoking for 40 to 50 years now and RJ Reynolds would welcome independent studies on the cigarette and perhaps over time, be able to measure the potential reduction reduction in risk that comes with this, what do you think the Surgeon General would say about your cigarette well the Surgeon General doesn't say much about any new brand of cigarette that comes out at least nothing favorably I can't speak for what the surgeon general's going to say what do you think they're going to say may probably think they're like all the rest talk about nickname for a second again Mary you ask the question back to full flavored cigarettes comparing those two Eclipse most full flavor brands have anywhere between point eight in one point seven milligrams of nicotine in them like cigarettes have less than that between, X and .9 and of course alter Light cigarettes have even less than that usually between point 1 and point five Eclipse has zero point two milligrams of nicotine and in the mild style 0.1 milligrams of nicotine okay the people smoke cigarettes for the oiled edification suspect nicotine so if you're not and that's part of why it's hard to quit smoking I think because you have the nicotine you go through withdrawal what, with these are you still you'll have the oral satisfaction but what about the nicotine that your body is used to marry I think in terms of nicotine and satisfaction that's something that each and every smoker is going to have to determine I can tell you that people across the country have smoke this cigarette many people have adopted the cigarette in the testing that we've done those that adopt the cigarette believe that it is satisfying I don't smoke anymore of these and what they do their usual brand will do I think we've all had situations where we may be switched from one brand to another, and if that's cigarette isn't satisfying you're going to go back to your usual brand and I think that's something that each person is going to have to make up their own mind this is not on the market anywhere right present I don't know when will it be want to know what's going to be on the law they liked it enough people like yourself have an opportunity to listen to what we're saying here and smoke the product and decide for yourself once we try this how do we get some more up we like it the question the question on cost again back to it cost more to manufacture but we will, charging the same price as a marble or your Benson & Hedges I'm you cigarettes are they the same like what you find in the store because like when I have migraines I can't smoke it irritates me more I mean it really bothers it would Escape be Eclipse would that be better I think that's a really difficult question to answer we really couldn't predict it, if it would be better with an eclipse or not we do know that the smoke is quite different and it's mostly water and glycerin but whether that would be okay in that situation I don't think we could predict that that would be Morrow to you have to try it going you may still have a controversy with your Surgeon General they're trying to stop kids from smoking you're introducing a cigarette which may stop them to smoke and it may be a problem do you think that the cigarettes going to kill the, no no everybody think that there's just people going to claim that that's have a problem I think the right there are some some people that are go look for some reasons to try to have this be out there but let's just hope that they enforce all the age restriction laws it we feel so the kids can't get their hands on cigarettes I have a question about that so because there's very little nicotine whereas that's nicotine that's coming out through that drapery Fabric or whatever it was and actually most of our us ours, o-tar not nicotine that is all the time it's in the in Eclipse stay inside you rather than come out so that's a good question the answer that is no because as we were talking about earlier because the clips primarily eats rather than Burns there's virtually no tar from burning tobacco early and flue-cured tobacco which is domestically produced tobacco this is much the same as any other cigarettes and finding the market really, it is Melinda has said there's nothing added to this tobacco that has like this Terry you meant about the paper and Kevin answered your question but somebody else earlier asked you know what is the standard sick but we just have a couple of extra overlaps because we have to attach the tip on and the filter with most cigarettes you just attaching the filter so it's just a couple extra layers are they you said this is going to come out of, regular a light and Menthol you said it's right for that depending on Market survey I trust Ryan for example there some cigarettes is some smokers that prefer more full-bodied full flavor cigarettes so we have a clips for light smokers Eclipse miles and the same is true for mental smokers now will this cigarette leave smell on your breath after you smoking like this not that's good because I lost a boyfriend because you know, he was a nonsmoker and you know if I want to go someplace and high and smoke a cigarette first thing smoking I told you guys get that smoke but if it's not it doesn't show up I keep on the fourth is regular maybe down the road we can make them longer but right now they're going to come in a standard king-size we have a car to take home yes what is the heat barrier, our question is what is the heat barrier and the heat very end the end is made of a material called spun Glass and its purpose is to keep the charcoal tip from getting too hot and burning back the paper and because the heat barrier doesn't burn it doesn't add anything to the smoke that isn't in other cigarette smoke thank you, any other questions I have a question can you be lighted okay Lucille if you've been smoking your clips for about the length of your usual cigarettes a six to seven minutes you started getting less smoke and that smoked taste sweeter weaker and Eclipse goes out that means that the eclipse is done and you wouldn't want to relight it at that point because all the flavors been taken out now if you literally Clips took a couple of drags and then walked away and it went out you came back to it you could we light it at that point, not if you finish smoking it any other questions that what's the carbon tip is it like charcoal that she's used to barbecue with no it's not the carbon tip on Eclipse is made of a very high Purity carbon heat source so this cigarette have anything in its bets worse for me than any other cigarette scam no it does not Eclipse uses a standard tobacco blend and there's nothing in that tobacco that isn't another cigarettes yes the carbon tip does it make it like the so you have more carbon monoxide than any other, cigarette no it does not Eclipse has about 6 to 9 milligrams of carbon monoxide which is actually less than the leading lights cigarette on the questions yes is eclipse going to cost more than conventional or regular cigarettes we know that it cost us more to manufacture Eclipse because it is different but we will be charging the same price as you would pay for any other full price brand like a marble or a Newport Carlton Winston, another question question yes then this Eclipse safer for me I think we all understand that smoking cigarettes carries with it some risk and if by safer you're asking is it without any risk we can't say that but when you consider the fact that Eclipse primarily Heats rather than burns the tobacco I think that Common Sense would tell you that at worst case you are looking at a risk that is no different than any other cigarette and it may in fact have less of a risk now scientists have been studying cigarettes for 40 to 50 years, RJ Reynolds would welcome independent and objective studies on this cigarette and perhaps over time will be able to measure just how much risk it may reduce, if you only have time for a couple quick drags before you have to do something how do you put it out really can't put it out and we light it what will happen is once you light it up you get it going and again it lasts for about 7 minutes if you walk away from it it'll keep going it might cool down you can go back and pick it up and take an extra puff on it and get it going again but that is one thing about an eclipse that's different you can't smash it out and then light it up again later what's that that's interesting, katene is it the same amount of nicotine in that cigarette as a regular cigarette good question we're going to talk about tar and nicotine but maybe it'd be a good idea to show them about what's in the smoke you how nice coaching again it's because it's mostly water and glycerin so in that sense it's more like Vapor than it is about the smoke and you can blow it out you can see Kevin's got a lot of smoke coming out but it disappears really quickly like your breath on a cold morning or something like that nobody ever said that you had to burn tobacco in order, smell good and really what this does is simply Heats it allows you to extract the flavor by doing that for the same reason that you don't have to burn tea leaves to make to know you can heat the water and extract the flavor it's similar to that so when you're through with that you actually have a hollowed-out cylinder that what you think's inside I would say that that never backhoe has come down once you get a chance to smoke will cut one of them open and take a look for yourself what's inside the same properties as a regular cigarette I mean as far as, what you're in taking into your body yes there's nothing in the tobacco in this cigarette that isn't in the tobacco of any other cigarette, I can do Rob put you to the test all right sometime when you take a regular cigarette you're blowing smoke through a handkerchief what does it lead and leads a big stain on your stun your handkerchief what's going to happen if I do the same thing with I love that you've asked that question like because we have a demonstration later that illustrates that but I'll go ahead and answer you now when you do that with an eclipse there is no stain is that fantastic question Greg would you just say that again so level of nicotine level of nicotine great again that comparing a Clips to other cigarettes most full, over cigarettes have nicotine levels ranging from point eight milligrams to 1.7 mg light cigarettes have less than that again anywhere between point six and point 9 mg with ultra low tar cigarettes having between point 1 and point five Eclipse has zero point 2 milligrams of nicotine with the Mi style having 0.1 milligrams of nicotine, so does that mean you smoke more most people that have smoked the cigarette will tell you that they're not smoking anymore but I think the issue that you're raising Gaynor is one of satisfaction and I think we've all switched and tried different brands of cigarettes and sometimes a cigarette isn't satisfied and if you were to smoke this one or any other one I find yourself wanting to smoke more than that's not a cigarette for you but I can tell you the people that have smoked this and switch to it will tell you it is a surprisingly satisfying cigarette given the level of tar and nicotine is there a Target date, for when they will be available to the consumer we don't know exactly when yet what we're doing right now is we're in the middle of talking to a lot of consumers like you a lot of smokers like you and letting them try eclipse and in some cases try more than just a cigarette or two and we're waiting to see what their reaction is and waiting for them to give us the cue that it's ready we think it's ready but we still have to talk to more smokers like you to confirm that so far so good though the results are very encouraging very much so how long have you been, it's been working on this but Melinda developed the idea 70 years are you serious RJ Reynolds has been working on it for many many years and the reason why Reynolds has been working on this product is because in talking to smokers like yourself you raise issues and concerns about what it's like to be a smoker and what we can do to make smoking more enjoyable for you so this cigarette was developed specifically with smokers in mind to help you recapture some of the smoking enjoyment, have you had to or been able to get any federal agency reaction or approval of tests or whatever they do know the federal government does not regulate cigarettes but if you're asking the question are there tests that are being done independent tests on the cigarette the answer is absolutely yes at the time that the cigarette is launched those tests will be on what may I try one when the we're going to let you try when in just a minute okay now like, I just said it down okay now oh so you're saying when I pick it up and smoke it at the flavors not there then I'll know if you pick it up and take a couple puffs on it and you don't get any smoke when you're finished in the cigarette is going to remain whole just like this the question is the question is the question of the question I would ask you is your bus will be which would you rather have in your house and empty what does, Dover is empty the casing and that's part of the heat barrier it's a piece of food grade aluminum foil that's laminated to the conventional cigarette paper that wraps around the cigarette and again that's to keep the tobacco from igniting and from the cigarette burning down but it does not burn itself and it doesn't add anything to the smoke that isn't in any in other cigarettes right yeah I'd like to know if anybody is tested this cigarette yes Eclipse has been tested by independent researchers in the results of those studies are available upon request",0.8159515972727273,0.735613,0.9128382
jfxh0257,"we are back on the Rucker the time is 20 7 p.m. with Stephen Romano on the executive committee yes what is his position he's the chief science officer for the company who is in charge of the proposed spin-off of the specialty Pharmaceuticals business, I'm not actively involved in that it's actually being run by as part of the board's responsibility I don't even know who's actually running point on it isn't it do you know who would know about that the specifics of that proposed spin-off within the company objection like I said it was a decision made at the board level back a couple years ago or my guess is it would be members of the management team that are actively involved in I'm not okay, if something don't just nothing okay good, do you agree that pharmaceutical marketing should support and promote the safe use of medications objection, pharmaceutical marketing should always focus in on the best use of the product or the patients that could benefit from it, degree that company's marketing Pharmaceuticals should always put patient safety before profits objection pharmaceutical companies should always put patient safety front of the business results do you agree that company's marketing Pharmaceuticals must always be truthful objection Pharmaceuticals are the most regulated industry and everything we do actually is dictated by the FDA in our claims so absolutely we should be in full compliance of that and when pharmaceutical sales rep sir, in the field speaking with Physicians everything they tell the physician should be truthful objection, everything they should tell the physician should be online with what they're approved to say, do you agree that a company marketing Pharmaceuticals must never make a false or misleading statement to the medical community objection again as a highly regulated industry what we say is controlled and that's what that's what the rep should be able to say what should be on label on point and approved and truthful section, do you agree that pharmaceutical companies marketing Pharmaceuticals must always accurately disclose information about the risks of their products in addition to the benefits of the product, I should always be fair balanced and every communication regarding the benefits and the risks of the product do you agree that pharmaceutical companies should be transparent about who or what they financially support which action again we're under specific regulatory requirements to report where we spend our money and how we support it so yes do you agree that company's marketing Pharmaceuticals should never disguise marketing as scientific or educational efforts objection, we should always be up front about how we're spending our dollars in promoting the product and how those are being positioned in the marketplace and you agree that pharmaceutical companies marketing Pharmaceuticals should be up front about when their marketing a product as opposed to when they're conveying scientific or educational information objection again as a regulatory requirement we were always up front about how would we actually are spending and promoting our product yes okay I believe those are all the questions I have for now mr. Godot is going to have some questions, has as well, so we're going to switch places here,good afternoon mr. O'Neil good afternoon my name is Gary got oh I'm with the law firm Keller we're back and we're among the lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the multidistrict litigation involving the opioids I have a few questions for you, first during your time when you had responsibilities with respect to Malik W generics business would you have viewed it as suspicious if you would learn that Physicians and pain clinics were purchasing Mallinckrodt oxycodone from a Mallinckrodt distributor who did business as a fit and every Supply Company objection again I was not actively involved, the details we had ordered monitoring where people that manage that that was their responsibility so I would not have seen that well I take it from that answer you were not aware of it of such a circumstance than is that correct yes that's correct that over call that all okay understanding that if you had become aware of that circumstance when when you had responsibility for the generics business would you have viewed that as a suspicious circumstance objection again we have such as ordering in place of my expectations they would have caught that it would have managed it appropriately, okay and if you had learned of the existence of such ordering and had learned would you have taken steps to evaluate what if any actions the Personnel under you with responsibility for suspicious order monitoring had taken with regard to those orders objection just as I mentioned before the suspicious ordering was separate from the commercial organization so my expectation is that they would have taken the appropriate actions that would not have been moved by scope of responsibility, would you have been surprised to learn that such orders had occurred over a thousand times objection again I have no recollection of that I don't even I didn't know the details of it understanding you don't have any understanding of whether it did or didn't happen if you had learned that there had been such orders filled over a thousand times by Mallinckrodt distributor who was doing business as of energy Supply would that have surprised you objection again it would not have been it would not have been something that I would have known or short been enough, age of at that point, understood and that's the reason my questions posed in a hypothetical if you will see if you had learned of of that circumstance would that have surprised you objection it wouldn't again having not been involved in it it's hard for me to speculate about how he'd react to it I don't know the details of it and it would hard wooden part for me to respond to that okay what if you had learned that such a such sales that occurred over 12,000 times objection same situation okay so as you sit here today you can't you can't answer one way or the other whether you would have been, surprised to learn that over 12,000 times Physicians and pain clinics had purchased Mallinckrodt oxycodone from a Mallinckrodt distributor who is doing business as a veterinary supply company that is correct I cannot respond to that, do you recall any time having understanding as to who Kathy Stewart was I do not how about Bill Ratliff I do not how about Karen Harper I do I remember Gary and who do you remember Karen Harper to be Karen was part of the finance organization and she had responsibility for chargebacks and working with with that team okay do you know if she had any responsibility for GE a compliance I do not recall do you know if she had any responsibility with respect to suspicious order monitoring I do not recall, okay and you what we've marked as exhibit 10 which is an email thread from back in 2008 and I realize this predates your time at Mallinckrodt and feel free to take a look at exhibit 10 and you can tell me if you're familiar with those emails,I've never seen this document before okay if you look on the second page of exhibit 10 you'll see an email from Victor Borelli and I think you testified earlier today that you were not familiar with who mr. Borelli is correct that is correct okay and you'll see that the email indicates that mr. Borelli was a national account manager the seeing that refresh your recollection in any regard with respect to mr. Elias not at all okay, if you turn turn back to the first page of exhibit 10 D the last email the one of the top of the first page from Kathy Stewart and I will tell you Miss Stewart has given a deposition in this litigation I believe at this time she's testified that she was the customer service director and Mister Mister Ratliff and ms/ms Harper I've also given depositions in this in this litigation they were both Mallinckrodt, he's at this time and Mister Mister Ratliff had responsibility for security ms/ms Harper well you've already told said that you familiar with Miss Harper so I won't characterize her role for you the just to give you some context has to at least my understanding of who these folks are the email from his Stewart the May 20 2008 email says FYI the customer service reps all state that Victor will, I'll tell them anything they want to hear just so he can get the sale and I will tell you that mrs. Stewart has confirmed Victor that she's referring to in that email is mr. Borelli and again understanding this email predates your time at Mount clock but if during your tenure when you had responsibility of overseeing the the the opioids or the generics business from Alcott if you had learned that the, customer service director had reported that one of the net that her service reps stated that one of the national account managers would tell them anything they want to hear just so he can get a sale would that have concerns you objection so again this document predates Me by five and a half years so it's hard for me to say anything on it as far as speculation because I was not even in the organization so it's really hard for me to react to try understand is frigates and what I'm asking you a hypothetical and just kind of putting, this email in front of you as sort of the predicate for the hypothetical and that is if during your time when on your watch at Mallinckrodt for the generics business if this email was dated 2013 or 2014 rather than 2008 and and it had come to your attention that the customer service director had soap made had passed along this information with respect to a national account manager with that of course your concern objection again you're asking me, speculate on something that did not that I have no recollection of anything like this happening when I was there so I can't even make a comment on that okay so as we sit here today you're unable to give me an answer as to whether if you had received an email similar to missus missus Stewart's email from 2008 in 2014 say reporting what she reports with respect to mr. Borelli as you sit here today you can't answer my questions to whether that would have caused you concern objection, again it's speculation based on what might have happened not as what did happen so it's hard for me to answer that question okay so this sort of thing if zooming that that the customer service directors reports had told her that a national account manager would tell them anything they want to hear they want to hear just to get a sale that's not the sort of thing that's so out of bounds for you that you can you can answer that hypothetically if you don't have it you know you would have been concerned about it objection again, the issue the issue comes down to speculating on something of might or might not have occurred this is something that it's hard for me to react to based on where we are today okay, let's look at it another document, and you what we want just there's the other one and you what we marked as exhibit 11, and this is another email thread that predates your time at Mallinckrodt but please take a look at those emails and tell me if you're familiar with them, and for the record this is Bates MN K T1 underscore 40's 5595 32 and exhibit 10 was began at Bates MN K T1 underscore 0 0 0 3 0 to 8 to 19, I've never seen this before okay fair enough, we've discussed in the context of the last exhibit mr. mr. Borelli in his position as national account manager the the one 2709 email that's the latest email that's an exhibit 11 is for mr. Borelli to a Steven Cochran at Key Source medical.com do you know who mr. Cochran is I do not do you know who key Source medical is do you know if that was a Malik right customer at any point I do not okay, I assume if you assume with me if you will that kids worse medical was an aliquot customer at that time of this of this email and, you'll see in the mister Cochran's General 2709 email to mr. Borelli referring to oxy 30s says keep them coming flying out of here it's like people are addicted to these things or something oh wait people are and mr. barreiro is response just like Doritos keep eating will make more again if if these emails were dated during your, and you're as when you had responsibility for the generics business and it had come to your attention that a national account manager had this email exchange with a customer of Malik W with that of course your concern objection, again we're dealing with hypotheticals right so this this this is something that happened long before I was here I'm not even familiar with who these people are the company always had a very direct conversation about how to manage our customers appropriately with order modern and other things like we spoke about earlier it's hard for me to react whether I would how I would say to this because I've never saw anything like this sure appreciate that you that you never saw anything like this and again I'm asking the question and a hypothetical because of that and sort of trying to, to put put put this email exchange in the time frame that would be pertinent to your responsibilities and Mallinckrodt fair to say that you would have viewed equating oxycodone 30s to Doritos as being something that was inappropriate for malachite national account manager to be doing objection again I we treat our are drugs as important options for patients and they should be treated like that across the board it's hard for me to react to this again it's not not anything, I'm familiar with I mean you'd agree with me that selling manufacturing and selling oxycodone is a serious business right objection, what we do on our business is always serious business okay and and it needs to be treated that way by bound Court Personnel correct objection again this is predates me it's hard for me to say whether what contacts is even in sure wholly apart from except you can put exhibit 11 aside for a moment just as a as a as in the abstract and you'd agree with me that it's important for Mallinckrodt Personnel to be treating the business of manufacturing and selling narcotics, Alex as a serious business right objection and again we have based on everything we put in place we talked about earlier the order monitoring the way the company monitors these things yes it's always treated as serious and it's important, for a company that's like Mallinckrodt this engaged in manufacturing and selling prescription narcotics to to foster a corporate culture that Accords that business the appropriate degree of seriousness and gravity right objection our corporate culture takes everything we do extremely serious and focused Appliance with all Regulatory and legal situations that we deal with okay I'd like to show you a video, oh that's been produced in the litigation, I had written somewhere the fates range and now look at this place that you have the Baton charge or just here we go the video is produced at Bates MN K T1 underscore 00 07 03 3463 if we could show the video please, she is the life of the party' he has never attended gs-13 medical degrees and a master's in the culinary arts she has lunch catered For represents and she buys every time she writes a prescription and Angel gets its wings she is the most interesting physician in the world I don't always write exhaust go but when I do I make sure the patients on the right, stay focused my friends, have you ever seen that video before okay do you know when it was produced I do not and I think you testified earlier today that when you joined Mallinckrodt exha go was sort of in the last stages of being a Mallinckrodt product is that correct that's correct okay do you know what that video was was in use at Mallinckrodt in any way during the time you were at Malik rat I do not know if during the time you were at Mallinckrodt you, had been aware that that video had been produced by Mallinckrodt for any purpose would that of course you any concern objection again I don't know anything about the product the video it's hard for me to speculate on it but not aware of it at all you think that that video Foster's the kind of serious corporate culture that takes into account the the gravity of the nature of the business of manufacturing sale prescription narcotics that would be appropriate for a company like malcontent objection again not seeing, it in its context not having seen it before it's hard for me to make any judgment calls on them okay just based on what we just saw on the screen you feel like you can't make a judgment on that objection I fear objection that's correct yes okay,one moment we're getting getting a document here, I had you what we've marked as exhibit 12 another document that's been produced in litigation,begins at Bates MN K T1 underscore 30's 273 4988 Skips a few pages which I believe were withheld in production and resumes that MN K T1 underscore 30-27 3499 for and concludes on paid sending in 5013 take a look through that if you would please mr. O'Neill and tell me if you, are familiar with that document, so I've never seen a document for I just need to take the time to go through it sure appreciates my time at the company so,okay with that document not at all I'd like to play for your recording that's been produced in the litigation of one of the songs it's contained in exhibit 12 and it's the lyrics if you want to follow them along are on the page page ending in Bates 3500 won the song was produced at MN K T1, score 00:07 029 131 please play the song for us,did you give her that song Forever okay have any idea of how it was used in alencar Turning Point not at all okay any idea who was responsible for producing it not at all understanding that exhibit 12 the email predates your your tenure at Malik lat if during your time with responsibility for the random business you had become aware of, of the song we just listened to being used by Mallinckrodt for any purpose would then of course you concern objection similar situation A predates me I don't know anything about this and it's hard for me to make any comments on okay it agree with me it's pretty clever would you objection again that's something I know nothing of it certainly a stab at being clever is an injection again same situation the so as you sit here today just reading his lyrics, listening to the song You Can't formulate a view as to how you would have reacted to it if you would learned that this was being used for any purpose in Mallinckrodt during your tenure it's a objection again it's caught I know nothing of this is hard for me to react to it okay now if you turn to the first page of of exhibit 12 it's the there's an email from a my, Mike Patterson do you know who that was I dunno who likewise yes and who was Mike I don't know what his role was at this point in time I'm like work for me which was years later he was my chief of staff okay and when did he work for his chief of staff 2014 13 through 15 something like that okay, and it's also addressed to a Michael wesler do you know who that is I do know Michael was yes and who is Michael wessler he was on the map marketing team at mallik Road okay and the email is from a CJ Sloan do you know who that is I do not okay you had a chance to look through exhibit 12 and it's in the form the attachments to the email, I already in the form of a sort of a script for a sort of a foe radio show with an announcer leading into various songs are able to gather that from the time you had to go through the use of it objection again I'm not familiar with the document at all all I can take it is from what I've read okay, and I will tell you we there's been produced in the litigation recordings of certain of the other songs that are the lyrics for which are included in exhibit 12 and I won't take the time today to to play any of the others, the I do have a couple of questions for you though if you turn to the page ending in for 997 give you a moment to get there, I'm sorry I sent it to the wrong page the page ending in 5003 if you would please,and there's heading so sweet relief double blind and in the first paragraph under anncr intro there's a census says in fact the famous dr. Hale prove that we could cut a pain score in half, you see that sentence I do any understanding of what that's referring to I do not, are you familiar with any double blind studies with respect to X all go indicating its ability to cut a pain score in half I am not, do you know if x all go cutting a pain score and half was a claim that the FDA authorized Mallinckrodt to assert I do not you don't have any recollection of that crowd at all,looking at exhibit 12 overall and the various song lyrics that are in here along with the be scripted intros and outros for the announcers again if you had learned during your tenure at Mallinckrodt that that these materials were being used for any purpose at Mallinckrodt would that of course your concern objection again it's specula its Peck, only speculation and I don't even I'm not aware of the document I'm not aware of how these were used and it's hard for me to speculate on what my response would be assumed for me that these that that would exhibit 12 reflects is a script of a reporting that was made to to portray if you will a radio program that would say an announcer would read the intro the space, would be played where you see the lyrics of the song and then the announcer would read the outro and then and then that recording was made available to Mallinckrodt its sales personnel and would it have caused you any concern if that recording was being made available by anyone at Mallinckrodt to the Mallinckrodt sales Personnel objection so I'm it's the same issue for me it's I've never seen this before I'm not aware of how it was used what it was used for or the issues attached to it so it's hard for me to speculate on, any of that okay and based on the assumptions that I gave you just a moment ago as you sit here today you're not you're not able to reach a view as to whether that would have caused you concern objection yes sir that's fair yes okay all right I don't have any further questions thank you very much, okay we are back in the record the time he's on the 253 p.m. good afternoon mr. O'Neil my name is Tricia her svelte and I'm an attorney representing the Tennessee plaintiffs and the Tennessee State Lord State Court litigation how are you doing good good afternoon good very good before we get started today I just wanted to put our objection on the record to the incomplete document production we've received thus far from Mallinckrodt the limited time available for our deposition and reserving our rights to read, suppose this witness as we do with every deposition in this case and now crop disagrees with the facts objection noted mr. Neal do you know anything specifically about the Tennessee State Court litigation I do not okay have you heard of the Tennessee State Court litigation I've not and earlier we talked about your position as president of specialty Pharmaceuticals to recall that testimony I do when you were president of specialty, Asuka calls for Mallinckrodt did you have a request reports about suspicious order monitoring or other anti diversion programs I did not, since you've been at Mallinckrodt which person if any on the executive committee is responsible for overseeing Mallinckrodt suspicious order monitoring anti diversion programs objection there is a separate order monitoring group that's part of a different piece of organization I don't remember where it sets but it's not in the commercial organization okay and do you know if there was someone on the executive committee that was overseeing responsibility for suspicious order monitoring I do not, do you recall during any executive committee meetings ever being given any reports that had to do with suspicious order monitoring at Mallinckrodt I do not, okay what about during executive committee meetings any reports on anti diversion efforts by mail and crud I do not okay what about on any of the other committees for which you sit did you ever recall any anti diversion efforts being discussed at those committee meetings I do not, okay during your time as a member on the executive committee on do you recall ever engaging in a conversation where the topic of discussion was whether Mallinckrodt suspicious order monitoring program was effective I do not, do you know what metrics were used to make a determination of whether Mallinckrodt suspicious order monitoring program was effective I do not, do you know anything about attempts to obtain a patent on Mallinckrodt suspicious order monitoring program I do not, have you ever been involved in a discussion of the costs of Mallinckrodt suspicious order monitoring programs I have not okay what about any anti diversion programs in general by now and cried I have not, during your time on the executive committee has the executive committee ever made a recommendation regarding suspicious order monitoring programs that Mallinckrodt I do not know okay what about anti diversion programs I do not know,here we talked a little bit earlier about your knowledge of the opioid abuse epidemic in this country do recall that testimony I do okay would you agree that the opioid epidemic is more severe in some areas of the country than in others objection I don't know the details of the of the epidemic for say okay have you ever heard that the opioid epidemic has hit the Appalachian area of the country harder than other areas of the country I'm aware of the of the challenge and I know that the, kitchen piece has been part of it but I don't know all the details behind it okay and do you consider Tennessee to be part of Appalachia I don't know, hey why don't you tell me what you consider to be part of Appalachia, based on Appalachian Mountains West Virginia that area that's as much as I know okay so you would say West Virginia again it's I always tied it to the west to the Appalachian Mountains that area so West Virginia that whole area of the central part of the state of the country okay and if those mountains go into East Tennessee would you consider East Tennessee part of Appalachia, objection that I don't I don't really Define what it is but yeah if it does I would guess so, hey you're aware that some areas of the country have higher addiction rates and others is that correct I am aware of the of the higher addiction rates of certain areas and other CS K and is one of those area the Appalachian region of country, I don't know all the details behind it be it's my understanding that it's a big problem there it's a challenge that yes okay and what about overdose rates is your understanding that overdose rates to opioids are a particular problem in Appalachia I don't know okay what about crime rates related opioids do you know about that in Appalachia I do not hey what about neonatal abstinence Syndrome have you heard of that I've not have you heard of babies being born dependent on opioids I have not, and all your time at Mallinckrodt you've never heard of babies being born dependent on opioids I've not case that wasn't discussed at any time in your position it wasn't, have you ever heard anyone at Mallinckrodt Express a concern about the opioid epidemic in Appalachia objection I have not, would you agree that there are certain characteristics that can place a geographic area at a greater risk of abuse and diversion of opioids objection if you had any training regarding the diversion of opioids, I have not, do you know if economic factors can be an indicator of potential abuse of opioids church I do not okay what about economic factors being a particular characteristic of diversion of opioids and rejection okay do you know if there's a linkage between the poverty rate of a particular area and the abuse of opioids injection I do not okay, what about education rate are you aware that there's a link if there's a link between education rates and the abuse and diversion of opioids I do not, when you became president of specialty sales at Mallinckrodt in 2013 was Mallinckrodt involved in attempting to expand the size of the opioid Market, I don't recall, okay, so when you took over that job you don't know if you were supposed to be expanding the market there again I don't recall at that point I'm what the what the what the group was I had remembered to pieces of the business the Branded piece and the generic piece and Walt ran the generic piece of my role was to really focus on the brand of piece of the business okay and so for either side that you just you just talked about having the both sides do you know if the goal and either of those sides was to expand the market for opioids I do not, do you know if any point during your tenure at Mallinckrodt you've been involved in the performance of any sort of an assessment to determine whether the opioid Market is too large I have not, during your tenure at Mallinckrodt have you ever been involved in any discussions to determine whether there were too many opioids being prescribed as a whole I have not hey what about too many opioids being prescribed to a particular region I have not, do you ever heard of Mallinckrodt evaluating whether abuse deterrent Technologies would stop the opioid Market from shrinking, I have not no I'm familiar with abuse deterrence Technologies because the conversation we had on Sir Thomas but no not in that context, would you agree that per capita opioid prescribing rates are linked to certain outcomes, I don't know the answer to that judge okay what about opioid per capita prescribing rates being linked to overdoses you with that information I'm not sure okay what about per capita opioid prescribing rates being linked to substance abuse treatment admissions are you aware of that linkage which I am not, would you agree that the availability of opioids is linked to the abuse and diversion of opioids I can't buy I don't know the answer to that do you know anything about the abuse or diversion of opioids I do not, since you've been at Mallinckrodt has anyone at Mallinckrodt to your knowledge ever considered altering sales practices based on the severity of the opioid epidemic in a specific area I don't know, you ever been made aware of or involved in any conversations about detailing physicians in a specific area last given the opioid epidemic affecting that area I do not, your been involved in discussions about targeting fewer physicians in a certain area where the opioid epidemic may be particularly severe I have not, have you ever been involved in any conversations about restricting the number of opioids Distributors can ship to a particular geographic area, what information do you know about providing Salesforce training on recognizing the signs of abuse and diversion by prescribers and it pharmacies I don't know you weren't aware of any of okay, do you know if anyone's ever suggested any of those measures training the sales force to recognize signs of abuse and diversion I do not, do you know if anyone ever talked at Mallinckrodt to your knowledge about restricting sales techniques or sales practices in the state of Tennessee I do not okay what about an Appalachia generally I do not okay do you know the amount of crap previously restricted sales in the State of Florida I do not,when you were a member of the executive committee was there ever any discussion about the opioid epidemic in Appalachia no okay what about Tennessee not that I recall okay what about any of the other committees on which you serve not that I recall, okay, me and you what we're going to Mark is plaintiffs exhibit 13 for those on the phone it's mnk hyphen T1 underscore zero zero zero seven two five seven one six nine through 71 72, I have all sorts there you go,let me know when you've had the opportunity to read through,okay and do you recognize this document I don't recall seeing it before okay is it an email that was sent from Nancy scooter to you can see Stroud ER I guess I see your name there on the third line on the to yes I'm on the list okay and who is Nancy Stroud ER Nancy stouter she's a member of our Communications team okay and you know you know her personally I do okay and it was sent on October 9th 2017 is that correct that's what the document says okay, and it was sent to your email address do you believe that you received this document and the ordinary course of business at Mallinckrodt objection, it's hard for me I I know this is an email that came to me that's the most I can say okay very good okay and looking at this email it is forwarding a link in an article from a today show segment is that correct based on the email that I just read yes that's correct okay and did you view the video of the today so today show clip I don't recall okay and did you before now did you read the article that was associated with this email I don't recall okay and the email article here, seems to talk about what was shown in the Today Show clip is that right based on my reading of the email right now that's what it seems to pay us and it's talking a bit about babies that are born dependent on opioids is that right based on my reading of the document right now yes okay and before when we talked you said you didn't know about babies being born dependent on opioids so can I take from that that you hadn't read this article before we sat here today injection I can't speculate it's hard for me to say I may have read it but time, goes by there's lots of things that I read so far from here remember well I'll submit to you the video that went along with this this piece on NBC news for the Today Show has a bit of video with a baby screaming and and when saying from detoxing from opioids do you recall seeing that at all objection I do not, okay and after you received this email were you aware of any discussions about the neonatal abstinence issue in Tennessee that's referenced in this article I don't recall, and Mallinckrodt to your knowledge continued selling drugs that were being shipped into Tennessee is that correct objection we continue to sell products at a national level what went into Tennessee it's hard for me to say okay and so when you say you shipped products at a national level that would include opioid products is that right our products were shipped through Distributors nationally including those products yes okay including opioid products and so when they were ship nationally there was no restriction to keep them from Tennessee is that, correct I don't know okay and if there were documents within mail and cuts possession that talks about the number of Mallinckrodt opioids that needed into Tennessee after October 9th 2017 do you have any reason to think that they're incorrect judge I get I don't know anything about any of those documents okay so yours as you sit here today you're telling me you don't know if Mallinckrodt opioids were sent to Tennessee after October 9th 2017 is that your testimony injection, yeah again I was not involved in the business I don't know how the products were shipped at that point in time I don't I don't know the details okay you weren't involved in which business the generic business at this point okay and what about the Branded business we were not out we didn't have any opioids in the portfolio that I see I see your distinction that you're making okay very good okay, and after you receive this email do you know if Mallinckrodt did anything in response to the neonatal abstinence syndrome issue in Tennessee Josh I do not okay is it concerning to you that their babies born dependent on opioids Direction, I feel terrible reading it, yeah I think I think it's it's a terrible thing okay, Andrew will Mark is exhibit 14, mnk hyphen T1 underscore zero zero zero eight three nine six five eight nine through, through 65 90 with an attachment that has not been stamped,hey I just handed you a document mr. O'Neill you look with me at the first page please of this exhibit 14, an email sent from you to sue ashbaugh dated October 29th 2013 as I crack it is, okay and in this email you ask if she can bring you a hard copy of an attached presentation for an update of that date at 2 p.m. is that right that's what the email says okay and who is soutache bah at that point she was my assistant okay and this was an email YouTube rigidly received from Terry tariff a is that correct that's what the document says yes okay do you have any reason to think this document is an authentic, the document is what it is so and it was sent from your email address that Mallinckrodt is that right Jackson that's what the document says yes okay okay and do you recall this email at all I do not okay so switching through to me here to the attached PowerPoint presentation, okay the Powerpoints titled here is Artemis XR executive committee update dated 10 29:13 do you see down I do okay and if you could switch with me to page 11 is this slide titled, group practice Managed Care access it's got a little map on it you see where I'm at I do okay, okay and so the title of this document is group practice Managed Care access and business rules were utilized to define and place reps and territories review and input from field sales creates buy-in and ownership did I read that correctly you did okay and then down here on the left hand area it contains what it calls a heatmap scenario do you see that, I do okay and it says that it depicts the total market and then has a little asterisk there for products including Hydro ape a poxy a Pap oxy ER doc cir Opana I are you Santa I'm not sure how to say that new Santa and new sent to ER do you see that I do okay and then when you look at when you look at this map do you recognize the state of Tennessee there in the middle I do okay and what color is the state of Tennessee primarily, it's red and pink okay and red and pink would be the most attractive areas according to this heat map is that correct based on my reading of the document again for seeing it for the first time not recalling it yes that's that's, that's how I read that okay and do you recall presenting this PowerPoint to the board of directors I do not okay would you have done that I would not have Okay would have been somebody from your teen again it's hard for me to remember or concern about based on just the names that are on the documents Terry who was the VP of marketing at the time would have been the one presenting us executive committee okay and do you know what need such a large Port large portions of Tennessee, attractive area according to this heat map, I do not okay, he can set that aside for me please, I'm going to hand you what will Mark is plaintiffs exhibit 15 for the record it's mnk underscore T NS ta 0 1956 641, through 42 with an attached PowerPoint,hey I've handed you an email sent from you too Laurie Hamilton dated November 8 2013 so that you see where I'm at I do okay and who is Lori Hamilton Lori is Mark's assistant, okay and Mark is who Mark Trudeau okay, okay so if you look for me at slide one, do you know who gave this presentation, I don't recall because but my name is on the presentation okay so is it possible that you gave this presentation again I don't remember but this again my name is on it so it's possible okay and so looking at the first slide here,under the key takeaway section says targeting top five Persona prescribers responsible for 20% of a puke acute prescriptions do you see where I'm at I do okay and then it says underneath most productive prescribers are driven by Orthopedics pain specialist surgeons and general practitioners is that correct that is what the document says yes okay and what factors determine a productive prescriber, I don't recall the interpretation of that would be again be how many patients they see how they how they think about the treatment of pain for the issues we discussed earlier around Target okay and then if you look down at the next one says launch critical success factors Salesforce expansion to 350 on track do you know what that means, that would mean that we were looking at potentially expanding our Salesforce footprint to 350 specialty wraps okay do you know if that occurred I do not know I do not recall okay if you switch with me to the second side,okay it says targeting 50k high-value prescribers across multiple Specialties did I read that correctly you did okay and then this slide also contains a heatmap scenario depicting the total Market which we had discussed earlier do you see where I'm at I do okay and then here it also has Tennessee as the red or most attractive designation do you see that I do okay do you know when coming up with the targeting information about, these particular areas if Mallinckrodt considered overdose rates I don't know okay what about addiction rates do you know when developing targeting lists or areas if Mallinckrodt considered addiction rates for opioids in those areas I do not know okay we're coming up with those targeting rates for sales of Mallinckrodt opioids do you know if Mallinckrodt considered the rate of neonatal abstinence births I do not know hey when coming up with the targeting list from Mallinckrodt opioids, do you know if Mallinckrodt considered the crime rates of a particular area I do not know okay and When developing targeting areas for Mallinckrodt opioids do you know if Mallinckrodt considered the prescribing rates per capita for opioids in those areas I do not know, if you look with me to the right section in the right bottom hand corner of that particular slide says highest days on therapy do you see where I'm at I do, okay do you know what highest days on therapy means it means the specialist who writes for a certain period of time as it relates to the prescription okay so that would mean for people who write for Physicians who write prescriptions for opioids for longer periods of time it would mean that yeah would mean the Physicians who write the the drug for a certain period of time as example Orthopedics on average based on this chart 10 days okay, thank you, okay you can set that aside for me please, do you know if Mallinckrodt has a program to examine high-volume prescribers for potential abuse and diversion I do not okay when you were president of specialty sales did Mallinckrodt have a program that required sales representatives to report signs of abuse and diversion they may encounter when detailing Physicians are pharmacies I don't know his mail and crowd ever had a program that required sales representatives to report potential signs of abuse and diversion they might come across while detailing Physicians or, I don't know, just Mallinckrodt have any kind of a program designed to identify prescribers that are over prescribing opioids I do not know, do you have male cats ever considered creating a program like that I do not know, who would have been in charge of determining whether Mallinckrodt should have a program like that which position again it would be based on the business and it hard for me to speculate I don't know where that would sit so I think you talked to before and I want to make sure I understand this about there being a generic side and a branded side and you don't warm at the Branded side than the generic side that is correct okay but you were technically over both for a period of time I was okay and so I think we've talked a bit about the generic stuff but, on the Branded side who would be the person who could answer my questions about training of the sales force to report signs of abuse and diversion I don't know who that would be, okay, I'm going to hand you over going to mark his plaintiffs exhibit 16, for the record is mnk underscore T NS ta 0 1 4 9 6 9 5 7 through 58, and take a look at this email let me know when you're finished reading it please, okay okay could you tell me what this document is that's an email, sent from who, top based on again I don't recall but I'd based on just my reading of the email from Todd Killian to me or for me to Todd Kelly and I should say okay and who's Todd Killian at that point Tom time Todd was responsible for Market access okay and what do you mean by market access to do it responsibly for relationships with payers but also pharmacies and distribution okay and the date of this email is April 28th 2014 okay and in this email that, that you send to Todd you say it concerns me greatly that we have Returns on the product already did I read that correctly okay you could you read the rest of your email there to him I can how can that be it was my impression that lock Target pharmacies were linked to high decile docs if a bottle is sitting there how did it not get pulled through we cannot afford to have product coming back okay and what is a Target Pharmacy that you're referring to here so these were pharmacies where there was, specific product movement of existing pain medications that we felt it was right to at least try to get a bottle into the pharmacy so if a physician wrote the prescription it was available for the patient to get filled okay and so you would have sales people detail those pharmacies in order to make sure that your product was available in case of physician wrote a prescription an issue that launched yes okay I'm and you'd already spoken to mr. Chow us earlier about hide us all doctors do you recall that testimony I did okay and so here you're talking about the linkage between, hi decile doctors and Target firmness thiis is that correct that's what the email says based on my reading it okay and so I want to make sure that I understand what you meant there so is what you're saying there that you could tell which pharmacies were probably filling prescriptions for our high opioid prescribing doctors what we're saying here based on my reading of the document is that there were Target docks Target Physicians that were that were more likely to describe the product and what we tried to do was make sure that, the product is available at pharmacies so that if they wrote it the patient can fulfill it yes okay so you could tell which pharmacies those High prescribing doctors use most often usually by ZIP code by geographic location okay and how would you get that information third party okay and a third party like whom I don't recall where it came from like I would somebody like IMS could be something like that okay,okay if you'll give me just one minute I'll see if I have any other questions for you, the record from 3:30 p.m., okay mr. O'Neill we're back from the short break I don't have any further questions for you today thank you",0.8445021230366492,0.5445325,0.9128393

jgfk0146,"you're watching W LAX TV Lexington, Now noon today Central Kentucky's most important news and information at noon with Sue Wiley and Tom Kenny, even if you don't smoke yourself you're going to end up paying for those that do at least according to a recent study by the Rand corporation that study said the nonsmoker is penalized by higher health insurance costs because of the high incidence of lung cancer and other smoking-related illnesses study said that state and local agencies end up paying for some of those medical costs it also took into account productivity losses at work while the smoking employee is out sick but not everyone agrees with these findings in that smoking non-smoking debate including two phds from George Mason University, today they have written a book called smoking in the state a new study from dr. Robert Tollison the director of the center for study of public choice and dr. Richard Wagner a nationally respected Economist from George Mason and dr. Wagner joins us live in our Newsroom and we should point out that his visit is being sponsored by the tobacco Institute but dr. Wagner is quick to point out they are his views not the industries it just so happens the industry likes a lot of what dr. Wagner has to say and dr. Wagner why doesn't the nonsmoker end up paying, well as you just said Tom we do find a very strong war on Tobacco in this country that has fueled by this economic doctrine of social cost that says that the cost of lost production and illness are paid for by non-smokers we dispute that proposition very strongly and find that whatever the adverse cost of smoking maybe those costs are paid for by smokers themselves and not by non-smokers, what about the call from our Surgeon General that calls for a smokeless Society by the year 2000 what is your reaction to that well I think this points to one of the dangers of the misuse of the doctrine of social cost in the kind of activist Society we have in this country that is to say that the principles of social costs can be applied to such things as coffee Salt the Surgeon General has suggested certain parts of, standard American breakfast met at the same time be full of social costs and I don't think we should aim to have a coffee free Society a salt-free or an egg free Society anymore than a smoke free society and certainly it is a debate that is not soon to be over but we do appreciate you coming in and talking to us about it dr. Richard Wagner again the name of the book is smoking in the state it is published by, Stanton books and it is very interesting reading the battle lines are clearly drawn dr. Wagner thanks for coming in thank you",0.8336760937500001,0.7139025,0.9128387

threaten our smokers Farmers Reynolds tobacco and the entire tobacco industry the only way to win a battle like this in Washington is to speak loud and long telling our story again and again, legislators need to see the faces and hear the voices that will be directly affected by their decisions they saw many of your faces when our employees went to Washington last year and that helped change the tax proposal from $2 a pack to 75 cents a pack before the legislators vote on Clinton 75-cent proposal make them look you in the eye again, I hope as many of you as possible we'll go to Washington with your co-workers on March 9, we're ready to go we're getting the best exploded we've got food and drinks on board we think it's great we can't wait for clock to roll out, a lot of people here from Tobaccoville 7 shift and we depart day shift everybody so excited that we're going to have a chance to fight the federal excise tax and we are ready to go there and fight and tell the government what we think about it I believe that they ought to be a lot more Community Support behind by RJ Reynolds in terms of what they mean to community jobs Etc so I'm here among many people that, Community project manners I hope this rally will produce for RJ Reynolds with combined with biltmore's eighteen twenty thousand people combined with 45 million other smokers true impact on Mister Clinton and his administration to not not increase taxes 75 cents so you figure that's that handles the health problem as far as your company's can smell we think that that addresses the concerns that have been raised by our critics where they have focused in on tar so if, but if they focused on nicotine could you take it out of the cigarettes without any problem well as scientists and Engineers here in our D I think that that could be done but I think the real issue here is that we as a company are providing a legal product to people who are looking for a pleasing sensory experience with mild pharmacology and we're providing a range of products that vary in tar and nicotine and we're allowing our, members who have the in this country the right to choose the products that they want to smoke and it goes across a wide range of tar and nicotine, okay like to get a pack of lights please may I see your ID there is an unlikely Ally in the fight to keep cigarettes out of the hands of a Down 75 party rentals doesn't want kids to smoke cigarettes we have a number of programs in place to help keep kids from smoking cigarettes right decisions right now is an in-school program that reaches three and a half million kids in 10,000 schools across the country it's helping kids resist peer pressure that's helping them make right decisions about lifestyle choices, a lot

jghj0223,"the following video tape is the second in a series of employee Communications programs we will hear from Jeff Bible Marie bring general counsel and Executive Vice President, president for external Affairs Steve Parrish senior vice president corporate Affairs and a group of employees representing all of our companies who participated in a question and answer session about important issues facing Philip Morris and the tobacco industry and now here's Jeff Bible I'm glad you're taking the time to join me today but I wish I could be having this conversation in person with every one of our more than 150,000 employees in 180 countries around the world, over the next several months I expected visit with as many of you as possible to discuss some of the issues of importance to you and our company I'm taking the opportunity to speak with you now because over the last few months the US tobacco industry and our company have been the focus of an unprecedented series of attacks some radical steps have been taken by a US government agency and endorsed by President Clinton that have the potential to lead to Serious harm to our entire industry, if left unchallenged, Food and Drug Administration commissioner David Kessler some members of the US Congress and many anti smoker activists have used a variety of tactics to support their efforts to attempt to regulate the ability of adult Americans to choose to smoke and the ability of our company to Market and sell our cigarette products in a free and competitive Marketplace, we shall not let their efforts go unchallenged in pursuit of their goal they have manipulated and distort facts to accuse Philip Morris of a broad array of improper conduct and to intact the Integrity of our company and its outstanding employees and we shall not let these accusations and attacks stand unchallenged not with the American public and not with the people of all of the markets where we conduct business and most of all, with our employees so first let's set the record straight on the issue of Youth smoking Philip Morris believes children should not smoke and should not have access to cigarettes smoking in purchasing cigarette to decisions for adults to make Philip Morris is committed to that philosophy around the world and we've taken actions to back up our commitment in fact we recently proposed an aggressive program in the u.s. directed at preventing youth access to cigarettes, we stand ready to work with anyone who truly wants to address this issue and we are working within the cultures and laws of the other countries where we do business to take appropriate actions to keep cigarettes away from kids, but do not be misled by what has been proposed by the president and the FDA rather than choosing to join us to make our program work and to explore other areas where we could work together to address this issue David Kessler an unelected Federal bureaucrat has decided to seek control over our industry and control over choices adults should be allowed to make in a free Society, you've heard me say it before if you're right and you fight you will win as you know we have a very recent example to back up that philosophy ABC accused us of spiking out cigarettes with extra nicotine we told them they were wrong and they settled anyway so we sued them and ABC apologized now let's look at the result DC this is World News Tonight the ten billion, a lawsuit filed against ABC News by Philip Morrison r.j. Reynolds was settled this evening with a statement ABC News agrees that we should not have reported that Philip Morris and Reynolds add significance amounts of nicotine from outside sources that was a mistake that was not delivered on the part of ABC but for which we accept responsibility and which requires correction we apologize to our audience Philip Morris and Reynolds Just does with ABC's have been a mistake we can't let stand David Kessler's grab for power, the u.s. tobacco industry and 45 million adult Americans smokers that is why as a first step we've joined with other us tobacco manufacturers in a suit to prevent Kessler from accomplishing what he set out to do let me say unequivocally our lawsuit has absolutely nothing to do with you smoking it has everything to do with an unbridled and illegal government action it has everything to do with stopping not only the DraStic and illegal actions now, on the table but the inevitable result of giving an unelected bureaucrat the power to do more this is going to be a long and tough fight but keep in mind we are right this is a country that still believes in Freedom and that is what this fights about while I'm confident that we shall Prevail in the end what concerns me as much or more is the highly orchestrated stream of statements speeches and news reports you've, been hearing that falsely accused Philip Morris of a broad array of improper conduct, what the people who make the accusation to done and continue to do is to manipulate and misrepresent the facts to their own ends these tactics are despicable I know these reports concern you as well I know you're hearing from friends and neighbors and family who have been hearing the same reports we want you to have the facts we're proud of our company and you have every reason to be proud as well, Mary bring our distinguished general counsel and Executive Vice President for external Affairs and equally distinguished Steve Parrish who is senior vice president corporate Affairs are going to provide you more information to put these tactics into their proper perspective let's join them as they discuss this with the group of Philip Morris employees from all segments of our company and remember we are right and we will fight and we intend to win for you and for our company, now we have with us today employees from Philip Morris USA Kraft Foods Miller Brewing Company Philip Morris Capital Corporation Philip Morris International Kraft Foods International and Philip Morris Management Corporation I want to thank all of you for coming here to participate in this meeting today and Steve and I will do our best to answer any questions you might have about these and other issues of concern, so let me ask now who has the first question my name is Marion Walgren I work with Philip Morris Management Corp in corporate contributions I had a question about the ABC case after reading the apology that appeared in the Wall Street Journal it appears that the apology was very carefully worded and I had a question as to whether or not Philip Morris companies was satisfied with the apology we're in let me try that one the answer is absolutely yes, we are very satisfied with the apology it is a total and complete Victory as far as we are concerned what you have seen in the last few days is a bit of revisionist History where ABC themselves are characterizing the program as not really focusing on spiking but as focusing on something else manipulation in the in the Recon process a number of the members of the press of picked up on that theme the plaintiffs lawyers and mr. Waxman and others have also picked up on that thing, said well this was really not a significant apology because it didn't it didn't go to the heart of the program as I say that is revisionist history if one looks at the program the day one program and of the public reaction after it starting with President Clinton and going all the way through the Waxman and Senator Kennedy and surgeongeneral Coop they were all focused on the outrageous charge that we were adding more nicotine to cigarettes in order to keep people smoking, the spiking allegation was the central core of that program that's why we brought the lawsuit and that's why we decided to settle it when ABC said we were wrong and we apologize so we think that that apology was quite significant and we think that we got exactly what we wanted to get when we brought the lawsuit was to vindicate ourselves in the Public's eye and make everyone realize that the outrageous allegation that we were spiking cigarettes was absolutely untrue that it was a lie, and they have now apologized for that and I think we should all feel very good about that I can tell you I certainly do my name is Glory makoni I work at Philip Morris International and Rye Brook and my concern is now that the media has backed down from accusing us of spiking cigarettes we still have the issue of manipulation to deal with doesn't that leave us vulnerable to get back into the spiking issue, and how do we protect ourselves from that and how do we put that completely to rest well I think that's a very good question because there's no there's no doubt that you still read a lot about the so-called manipulation and I think it's important to realize that just as we do not Spike nor do we manipulate we simply don't do it I think we put the spiking issue to rest once and for all and hopefully we'll be able in the near future, put the manipulation issue to rest as well the fact of the matter is that every cigarette that we manufacture has to comply with the published tar and nicotine nicotine delivery numbers that are required by the Federal Trade Commission so we manufacture our cigarettes and through a process of blending and filtration we ensure that we are delivering to the smoker exactly the level of tar and nicotine that, we indicate we're going to deliver now that's not manipulation that's simply quality control manipulation is a word that has a sort of pejorative connotation in suggest that we're doing something wrong and that's the reason that the anti-smoking activists use the word but there is not a single thing in any of our documents are in any of the evidence that has been disclosed by dr. Kessler or mr. Waxman which indicates that we are manipulating nicotine in order to keep people smoking which is the, gauge that many of them make the fact of the matter is if you look back over the history of our products during the past several years there has been a continual decline in the amount of nicotine that is delivered to smokers and as a matter of fact if you look at the focus of the reconstituted process which was the subject of some of the ABC program and other critics the reconstituted process takes nicotine out of the, tobacco leaf and every step of the process and at the end of that process there's less nicotine in the sheet that is used for use in manufacturing circuit cigarettes then there was in the original plant before it went into that process so the simply isn't any truth to it and I think that in due course when we have the opportunity in courtrooms or in other forums like the Food and Drug Administration to get our side of the story across it will, come clear that there simply isn't anything to the manipulation charge just as there was not to the Spike Lee Joint my name is Paul Farkas I work at the Stockton Street facility in Richmond and Me Chief shops do it for the International Association of machinists and Aerospace workers the recent story in the Richmond newspapers concerning the study conducted in Chesterfield County with the third grade students his calls all morale problem in the factory due to the fact of the adverse, public opinion that towards Philip Morris employees you care to comment further on that issue sure let me just try to put that proposed study into perspective first remember that it was never proposed that we were going to give cigarettes to kids it was never proposed that we were going to do research on nicotine and children we were doing or what we were talking about doing was something that people who are funded by the federal government we're doing namely looking at personality profiles, of people who were smokers and comparing them to personality profiles of people who turned out not to be smokers their proposal which was not carried out was to try to identify whether these specific children turned out to be smokers when they were adults so to characterize this as nicotine research on kids or research on smoking and kids is absolutely untrue and outrageous I'm Rose Wang from Kraft Foods International regarding the electroshock study, what is the relevance of that subject to waxman's agenda or Kessler's agenda number one and the second question is how is that study any more or less extraordinary than any you know other study that's being done in Laboratories and universities worldwide but you make two very good points that study was done in complete accordance with scientific protocols that others outside of Philip Morris had been doing before, we did the study it's also important to remember that this very mild electric shock that we were talking about was administered to the fingers I think some people tried to give the impression that it was something much more Insidious than that it was done according to a strict scientific protocol that have been done by independent scientists outside of Philip Morris and that was all reported in the scientific literature it was part of a discussion that was going on both inside our industry and outside the industry, which is why do people smoke what effects if any does smoking have on stress and other things and scientists inside the industry and outside the industry were interested in those things and so they use scientifically accepted protocols to try to address the issue you know Steve I'd like to just add one thing to his kind of anecdotal but as to that issue but I think it's kind of interesting mr. Waxman made it sound as though this was some sort of aberrational way out, theremin that Philip Morris was conducting that everyone should be shocked about I remember when I was in college the psychology department was always posting ads on the bulletin board saying for $5 any student can volunteer to be a participant in this experiment and they the experiments went on for pages I mean how long could you stand on one foot for example I remember was one of them and the students were flocking to volunteer for these programs we way of have making a few extra bucks so, this is commonplace at universities psychology departments are always recruiting students to participate in these experiments and it's something that goes on and I think has gone on for a long long time and heard mr. Waxman to suggest that somehow this was a unique experiment that Philip Morris was sponsoring is simply unrealistic and doesn't it doesn't relate to the real world of what goes on in University campuses with respect to the psychology departments in those universities my name is, are cuadrado an engineer with Kraft Foods out of Tarrytown New York I have a question about all these documents we've been hearing so much about where do they come from and how are they leaked out to the Press earlier that's an excellent question and I'm glad to have the opportunity to talk about a little bit you know Senator McCarthy a long time ago developed a device for getting media attention by which he used to say I have in my brief, case 400 secret documents which prove x y and z now the minute you label a document is secret somehow it conveys to the public that there's something wrong with the document and there's something wrong with the person who wrote the document the fact of the matter is all this discussion recently about documents is part of this disinformation campaign that Steve and I have been talking about most companies in fact most individuals have documents which they regard as confidential now in the case, of a company the reason a document is considered confidential is because it contains a trade secret or it has competitive information that you don't want your competitors to to be to have access to so what happens in the typical lawsuit as we've had over the past 40 years is the plaintiffs asked us for some of our documents we label those documents or some of them when we produce them to the other side as confidential because they do contain confidential information that doesn't mean their secret what it means is, they shouldn't be disclosed to the world because they're competitively sensitive or they contain Trade Secrets now almost all of the documents that you've read about in The Press recently are documents that have been produced in cases during the past several years in which we have been litigants the primary case in which that happened was the chip alone case many of these documents were actually introduced into evidence of the chip alone case at which point they no longer were confidential and they certainly weren't Secret, what has happened is that the plaintiffs who are involved in the new litigation the new cases that have been brought up by brought against us recently have obtained access to these documents which they were entitled to do because they are now representing plaintiffs in other cases but instead of honoring the confidentiality of orders that have been entered by courts in order to preserve the confidentiality of these documents they have leaked them to the press or to Henry Waxman or to the FDA knowing that these anti-tobacco, go activists would then use these documents and try to characterize them in such a way as to make the company and the industry look bad and that's exactly what they've been trying to do the fact of the matter is as Steve indicated with respect to some of the documents that mr. Waxman is referred to there's nothing Sinister about these documents there's nothing in there that we are ashamed of or are concerned about but what they are trying to do is to take little Snippets out of the documents quote them, in the public press take them out of context mischaracterize them and try to try to paint a picture of improper conduct and as Steve has said we're not going to let them get away with that we are going to defend ourselves and make it clear what is going on out there and why these people are doing that, my name is Vernon Martin from Philip Morris USA is there a legal course of action that we can take at Philip Morris to stop boat Waxman and Kessler from taking information out of context and giving it to the public we're that's a good question I know we all share the same sense of frustration that you have if these people are doing something improper why can't we do something about it Congressman Waxman recently has only been making these statements, lines on the floor of the House of Representatives where he enjoys immunity and he can't be challenged legally the fact of the matter is when something really egregious happens we have three Alternatives we can either initial immediately issue a statement setting forth our side of the story which is what we have done in the case of the recent documents that mr. Waxman has talked about and hope that the media will at least, our side of the story doesn't always happen but we try to get our side of the story out and we're being much more aggressive and proactive about that the other thing we can do is to wait until we come to trial in some of these cases that are pending and have an opportunity to explain these documents to pull the put the full document into evidence to have the witness talk about the document so that an impartial jury will hear the whole story and then render a judgment and in that connection, and it's very interesting to note that in over 40 years of litigation we have never lost a case and the reason for that is because once the jury does hear the whole story they know we're right and they rule in our favor the third thing we can do is to bring a lawsuit against the person who's making these outrageous accusations we did that in ABC and as you know we succeeded in in vindicating ourselves against this spiking charge but you can't constantly be suing everybody who says, something negative about the tobacco industry or we'd have to hire every lawyer in America so we have to choose our targets carefully we have to do what we think is the right thing under the circumstances and I think a combination of all three of these things will ultimately Prevail because I think the American people really have common sense we see that over and over again in all of our cases and when a jury of 12 people or 10 people sits there and here's all the evidence they rule in our favor and I'm confident when the American people hear the whole story, story they will ruin our favor as well okay I'm Alex Russo with Philip Morris Capital Corporation my question is can the FDA a certain narrow jurisdiction over tobacco we don't think dr. Kessler has jurisdiction to proceed against cigarettes under any statute and there's a long history of Court interpretations and congressional action which indicates that that's the fact what you have here is really nothing more than a naked grasping of Power by dr. Kessler to, sighs jurisdiction which Congress has not conferred upon him and I can't believe the Congress or the courts would be happy about that our court challenge is obviously seeking to invalidate it under the law and as you know many Congressmen including Senator Ford from Kentucky have indicated that they don't think Congress has given dr. Kessler the authority to do this and they're talking about taking action as well it appears that tobacco has become the top priority for David Kessler why is that, that in light of all the responsibilities that he's got officially on Food and Drugs well there's been a lot of speculation about that I was I saw an article in the paper the other day that speculated that perhaps the reason that dr. Kessler has tried to take on Tobacco in the guise of you smoking is because of all the criticism that has been directed at him because of the agency's failure to give quick approval to life-saving drugs and life-saving medical devices, the agency has come under a tremendous amount of attack because of its failure to address issues like food ingredients that I hear from the people in our food company how it takes so long to get a new food ingredient approved through the FDA and the FDA has been under a tremendous amount of attack and dr. Kessler in particular for those clear failings that are clearly under the law his responsibilities so some have speculated that the reason that he has gone after tobacco and talk about you, smoking is to try to divert some attention from the real problems that he has I'm Beth Partington with Miller Brewing Company in Milwaukee my question is now that there are several federal agencies that have jurisdiction over tobacco products what is David Kessler's motivation for trying to get the the FDA involved in this at this point and could this set a precedent for other products that contain alcohol or caffeine well that I think it's pretty clear what David Kessler is agenda is and what his motive, is he has made it clear in articles that have come out recently about the recent assertion of jurisdiction by him have made it clear that he has had a preoccupation with smoking and cigarettes for the last two years perhaps even as far back as when he became commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration I think it's quite clear that he wants to exercise jurisdiction in order that he can control cigarettes the manufacturing and the sale of cigarettes in the marketing of cigarettes in the United, Tate's now I think he also realizes that that would be a difficult thing for him to do from the beginning and he might not have succeeded in getting the administration to support his effort so he's cloak that effort by saying that really all he's interested in is keeping cigarettes away from kids now as you know we also are interested in keeping cigarettes away from kids and we recently announced an enhanced program to try to restrict access to cigarettes by you, but the fact of the matter is that if they would Kessler ever does succeed in getting jurisdiction over cigarettes he would have the power and the ability to go much further than simply promulgating regulations for youth access in fact he would have the power to declare that cigarettes are unsafe and to ban them entirely from the market and I really believe in my own opinion is that his ultimate purpose and objective is to prohibit smoking and, is why we are fighting his effort as vigorously as we can because we are not about to let the federal government or the FDA come in and illegally seized power which has never been conferred upon them by Congress and make decisions which will affect the ability of adults in this country to determine whether or not they want to smoke there are 45 to 50 million adult smokers in this country they enjoy a lawful product and it is not for David Kessler to determine, they can continue to use that product I have a question on the underage smoking issue this Philip Morris support National legislation that addresses the youth smoking issue actually there already is federal legislation addressing the youth access issue and it's a very important point in 1992 there was legislation sponsored by former Congressman Mike sign are that required the states to begin, in to address the issue of Youth smoking Congress made a decision it was a democratically controlled Congress and at that time we had a Republican president the democratically controlled Congress passed a law President Bush signed it that said this is a state issue the states need to establish licensing schemes for retailers the state's need to undertake programs to enforce laws to make sure that there are existing laws making it illegal to sell cigarettes to kids unfortunately Congress, assign responsibility for developing model regulations to the Department of Health and Human Services those regulations have never even come out now three years later we exhibiting are true commitment to the issue have worked on our own not even waiting for the regulations to come out of the federal government we worked very hard over the last few years so that now there is a minimum age of purchase in every state in the United States we've worked on licensing and as part of the recent, program that we've announced which is not a new commitment to limiting you smoking but just a furtherance of our existing commitment we said we're not going to sample cigarettes anymore we're not going to send cigarettes through the mail we're going to work with our retailers to educate the public on what the minimum age of purchases we're going to help train retail employees we're going to sanction certain retailers who don't comply with the law and we're going to work with state legislators as Congress has told us to do to get legislation on, books in the states that can have an impact now so that's a real meaningful program that we think we've put forward and a lot of people are joining with us to try to make it happen and make it happen real quickly thank you thank you Steve I just want to go back from and I didn't finish I didn't answer those second part of your question best which is if dr. Kessler is successful in achieving jurisdiction over cigarettes could he then seek to assert jurisdiction over caffeine and alcohol and I think the answer is that he probably could and that's why I think, Americans whether they like smoking or not should be very concerned about what he's doing if a cigarette is considered by dr. Kessler to be a delivery device for nicotine then why isn't coffee a delivery advice for device for caffeine and why isn't beer delivery advice for alcohol and why isn't milk a delivery device for cholesterol it's a slippery slope at once you give dr. Kessler the authority to go after cigarettes there's no reason jurisdictionally or logically why he could not, not then Embark upon at an attack upon any product that doesn't happen to suit his particular like so I think it's a very serious problem not just for our industry but for many other Industries and for the American public generally because I think if the last election showed one thing it certainly showed that the American people are not interested in heaven and having an unelected bureaucrat in Washington telling them how to live their lives, although cigarette advertising is directed towards the adult Market there must be some unavoidable appeal to some youth this Philip Morris have standards to minimize the youth appeal of a given marketing program we absolutely do have standards and let me get to that in a minute but first let me say that the studies that have been done on the subject of does advertising entice kids to smoke are pretty clear that in fact they're very clear that advertising is not what makes people, we'll start a smoking and in fact it's been very interesting to me as I've seen interviews on television and reports in the newspapers of interviews with kids who say it's not advertising that's not why I smoke its peer pressure it's the fact that my parents smoke it's a lot of different things but it's not advertising that makes people smoking a lot of those Studies have actually been cited by the Surgeon General in the surgeon general's reports to Congress having said that we have very strict guidelines and have for a number, of years about where we place cigarette advertising for example we currently don't play cigarette Billboards within 500 feet of schools for example we have very strict guidelines about what Publications we will place cigarette advertising in and if a publication has more than a very small percentage of Youth readership we won't advertise at all in those Publications so those are some real serious things that we've been doing for a number of years just following up on Alex's question I think, the timing of recent press releases has led people to believe that the action against access program was really done in response to Congressman Waxman was it indeed started quite a bit sooner than them absolutely last year the Institute of medicine issued a report for the federal government on the subject of Youth smoking and The Institute of medicine made a number of recommendations of things that could be done to address the issue that came out last year we took a look at that report, and a lot of the things that were recommended in that report have been incorporated into our action against Access program we've had a long-standing commitment we've been a leader in the industry in doing things to keep cigarettes out of the hands of kids when the Institute of medicine report came out we took a look at it and said there are some other things that we can do so we decided to take the steps and do them and we're going to do those and we're going to do those no matter what happens with the Food and Drug Administration and what happens in Congress because we're committed to the issue, shoe with all of the restrictions does being put on our company with regards to the sponsorship of events what if any will affect be on one our event Marketing Group our direct Marketing Group what effect will it have on events that we sponsor and the consumers of those events that's a very good question the regulations as proposed, would have a dramatic effect on and impact on our ability to sponsor events like that and on the ability of the people who participate in those vents events to continue to participate they some of those events might disappear altogether but I think it's important to remember that for a lot of reasons we believe those proposals won't go into effect first of all we filed our lawsuit which we think will be successful to prevent the FDA from asserting jurisdiction over us, we also have seen great opposition from consumers and people who are involved in those events being expressed about the proposal and those our community are going to be communicated to the Congress and to the FDA so I think it's not likely that those proposals will actually take effect but they certainly would have a dramatic impact if they did okay with all of the heat that we're facing at Philip Morris and also the heat that the tobacco, industry is facing what affirmative steps are we taking to attract employees to Philip Morris and what steps are we taking to retain employees that we currently have let me try the second part of that first we're trying to do a whole lot of things as as we very aggressively work to make our position known to the public we're going to do the same thing to our employees because I know from my personal experience I know everybody in this room, gets questions when they're with their friends and it's a serious potential problem we want to get the word out to the public we want to get the word out to our employees we're going to very aggressively do that you heard Jeff he's very committed to that not just on these issues but all of our issues so we're going to aggressively do that and I know the human resources department in everybody else who's involved in recruitment understands the issue here which is we've got, to make people understand what a truly great company this is and what a very very bright future we have the strength of this company over the years has been built on the people as well as the incredible brands that we have and I think that as we go out and put a face on this company and not just be known as a corporation but 165,000 people around the world and when people understand the strength of our business and our commitment to these issues they're going to realize this is a great company to work for and will continue, in you to get an outstanding people as individual employees what can we do to help a lot and we need you to do a lot first of all right now there is an opportunity with the FDA docket and with your local Congress representatives in Congress Congress and Senators to write to them to call them as I have gotten more and more involved in the political activities that are going, on the one thing that has become crystal clear to me is that one phone call and one real letter written from the heart in somebody's own words can make a huge difference sometimes I used to always think that one letter is not going to do it but one letter can have a big impact one phone call from the heart can have a big impact the other thing that I think is so important is give us your feedback about what we're doing because we need your help there too and there are no bad ideas, Diaz there are just the only shame is if a good idea never gets expressed and talk to your friends and if they agree that smoking is an adult choice and adults ought to be free to make that decision that they communicate that position and that they understand that their one letter or their one phone call or their one vote can make a big difference so so those are the sorts of things that I think it can be very important, the various events that are happening what's going to be the impact to the company and specifically how long is this going to last how much is it going to cost and what's the impact to the bottom lines of the employees and the shareholders I've been asking how long is this going to last that's a terrific question let me try the Steve can supplement if he wants but you know I was taught as a kid to not spend so much time focusing on negative things and count your blessings well, we have a lot of blessings that we can count in this company I would say first and foremost is that we have a spectacular chairman he's a man of great honesty and integrity he feels a great sense of passion about these issues he fights for what he thinks is right and he's an inspiration to all of us and I think that that is certainly what I would put at the top of the list in terms of our blessings in addition to that we have terrific businesses they're all they're all, all doing very well not only domestically but internationally as well we have as Steve said before one of our greatest strengths is the hundred and sixty thousand employees throughout the world who are dedicated and loyal to the company and we have great products and that we are able to offer to our consumers so it's a very strong and vital company and I think the one thing that characterizes this company more than anything else is its resilience sure we have problems from, kind of time we had a Marlboro Friday we had a recall we have all this negative publicity but that's been going on for years and at the end of the day we always end up as a resilient Corporation bouncing back and doing even better the next time and I think that's been our track record it's our heritage and I think it will be our future as well now obviously it takes a lot of resources to defend these lawsuits and to fight dr. Kessler in the courts, and to respond to the press and to fight networks when they accuse us of things that we haven't done but I think one of the keys to our strength is that as a company we have been willing to devote whatever resources are necessary to vindicate ourselves and that will continue to be our strength I don't know what it's going to cost whatever it costs were prepared to spend it because it's important not only for our shareholders but for our own integrity and for the morale of our of ourselves, and all of our employees so we're committed to this fight however long it takes and I am confident that we will win it because we are right, well let's let me say thank you again all of you for coming here I hope we've had a chance to answer the questions that you have and address any concerns that you have and you know we are even though a big company a very informal one so if any of you should think of any questions after this meeting breaks up just pick up the phone and call Steve or me and we'll be happy to try to address them and we look forward to seeing you again back in your, in your own locations and I think we all should probably get back and trying to earn a earn a buck for the company thanks a lot",0.8560593929411763,0.70160574,0.9128394
jgxh0257,"you're back on the record at 141 p.m. good afternoon mr. Webb my name is Seamus Kelly I'm representing plaintiffs in the Tennessee lawsuits that have been crossed noticed in this deposition as laid out in our previous deposition records where we've been crossed noticed I'd first like to object to the deposition on behalf of our clients do to Mound crops failures to comply with the state and federal cooperation protocol, we disagree with that assertion like I'm go ahead thank you, mr. up did you do any specific preparation based on a separate lawsuit in Tennessee, no Kim, looking back on your testimony today there were several times where it was specified that certain materials would have been distributed in Ohio would you say the same for Tennessee objection, I I would say that the material was available for National Distribution but to say whether material went to Ohio or Tennessee I have no knowledge of it would not Kim,looking at topic to the role of wholesalers Distributors and pharmacies, including but not limited to defendants in the supply chain for your opioid products and the responsibilities of each with respect to Marketing sales and supply, did Mallinckrodt generics detail pharmacies in Tennessee, objection the Forum, I'm not aware of our generic steam detailing specifically detailing pharmacist and Interstate okay are you aware of them detailing pharmacies in general, no, and are you aware of Mallinckrodt detailing pharmacies regarding branded opioid products, the for a period there and I don't know what time it was but pharmacist were included in our call plan as far as stocking with our brain in Salesforce, and with topic 3 specifically, warning letter sent to you by the FDA and any other Communications between you and the FDA regarding your marketing of your opioid products your response to these letters all subsequent actions you took in response to those Communications and all budgets for any such actions by year, was there any of these budgets state-specific, I'm not aware of any letters from the FDA regarding any specific State yeah but the the question is where budgets budget or responses to FDA letters where their budgets that were state-specific know, regarding topic eight and this again is actions taken by Mallinckrodt after the CDC declared an opioid epidemic in 2011, were there changes the mound krauts opioid allocations in Tennessee, not to my knowledge, did Mallinckrodt do anything differently in Tennessee after the CDC declared an opioid epidemic objection now, did Mallinckrodt have an initiative to distribute bags for opioid disposal, we did our medication disposal pouch in the shoe and he recall Tennessee being included in that, objection because I'm not I do not specifically recall if Tennessee was or was not included or excluded we did several National programs though with retail pharmacies and they may have been through their distribution Network had bags distributed to Tennessee, the past him exhibit, this is exhibit 22 and it's Bates amped mnk underscored T NS ta 0 4 4 2 3 1 6 6,do you have a coffee, okay does that refresh your memory I'm familiar with this, so it, is it correct that Tennessee was a priority state for this bag initiative, the the intent was to distribute bags these are the medication disposal pouches that were made available to patients to neutralize and chemicaly chemicaly neutralized and then safely dispose and get rid of unwanted or unused medications opioids from their home this program was in collaboration with good neighbor pharmacies Good Neighbor Pharmacy has provided us a list of where their pharmacies were, we wanted to specifically provide pouches to what we would consider the Appalachian area this was an attempt to identify what states might be within that geographical area, all right and looking specifically at your response to the top of this email is it accurate to say that you are highlighting the Appalachia region for this initiative, objection it speaks for its form, we wanted to put the pouches into communities and States we thought would have the greatest value and what is your under what is the Appalachia region, well it's defined as obviously well those states that are when which the Appalachian Mountains run through, and it this time you were targeting those States for this initiative, for this initiative partnering through the good neighbor pharmacies we wanted to try to get its many pouches into these states as we could, through Good Neighbor pharmacies though, and why was Ohio not a priority State it's not that objection because it's not that it wasn't a priority State we already had a pouch event or several least two pouch events already taking place in Ohio particularly Summit County through partnership with Community leaders so we wanted to attempt to make as many pouches available in places around the country as we could without putting too many into one particular area, but the focus was on the Appalachia for this particular campaign is but we had distributed over two million pouches so we wanted to whole list of through our entire campaign so we wanted to make sure that we could be a value to as many states as we could, these were donated free of charge by the way, so strike that I'm going to hand you another exhibit, this is exhibit 23,and exhibit 23 is Bates and mnk underscore T NS ta 00 1984 69 with an attachment that is M NK T NS ta 00 1984 70, I think this was about the last just give me it back to you thank you sure, if you have another copy,okay thanks I'd like you to look at page 5 of the attachment, okay, if you could read Point number two for me, Point number two target 19 states with an asterisk that currently do not include methadone as a covered medication treatment option to ensure s UD which is substance use disorder patients have access to a full range of effective medications and parentheses purple States and looking to the map to the right which, DC that Tennessee is indicated to be one of those states that two or fewer covered correct and what do you understand that to mean this this map was provided by the national drug abuse treatment system survey data, as far as patients who have a substance use disorder access to addiction treatment clinics there are three FDA-approved medications Vivitrol is their trade name Suboxone and methadone or met the dose those states that are in purple are interesting is that they have ax patients who have a substance use disorder have access to only two are fewer than 80 medication, such treatment okay so would that make Tennessee one of the 19 targeted States it was an identified as a state correct but does it mean that we acted on anything and intimacy if you turn to page 16, okay, do you know why Tennessee was not one of the ten States targeted, the recognized yeah recognizing that, but for sake of clarification we were not able to engage in any states so there's this is a plan this was a plan that we had identified our efforts for addiction trip more place at the federal level but these 10 states we had contract consulate these states so this was a legislative approach to eliminate barriers to treatment that the state may or may not have had in place that we needed to do more diligence on we would need it need have needed help through, contract counselor lobbyists and these were the states that we had for the most part contract lobbyist and obviously, so this point there was no longer a focus on Appalachia objections go, now I think what you're conflating the two initiatives we had a medication pouch disposal initiative which was a partnership with communities to help rid homes of unused opioids and to keep them from being misused or diverted safely dispose of them they're chemically neutralizing so we were purchasing pouches through another third-party group another manufacturer and then donating them to community groups that was the Apple a chef, heard that we were working with good neighbor pharmacies this particular initiative that we're referring to was states that we have identified or made to be were made aware of through the federal government that had barriers to access a getting people into treatment who had a substance use disorder we were working collaboratively to identify where and what those barriers were and how we can help remove them to expand treatment,wake me up to topic 24, and earlier you were discussing speaker series, I'll pass you can exhibit, this is exhibit 24 it is mnk underscored T NS ta zero zero one eight four one seven three, and I will, I'll let you know that we did slightly modify this spreadsheet that was in your custodial filed where it just excludes all states except for Tennessee, and we're documents such as this used for tracking speaker series objection to scope, we would I can't speak to this particular document but documents that we would have any time of speakers serious speaker event was taking place as part of the farmer guidelines we were required to track and identify excuse me which for the sunshine reporting which Physicians are Healthcare Providers attended so there would be a sign-in sheet, and we're there ever non prescribers that would attend these meetings, well I'm not saying that they were never sometimes a physician would bring his or her nurse but we the time of making the education material program available we would state that this was for healthcare professionals are Physicians only, in the past you will be marked exhibit 25, thank you this exhibit is Bates number mnk underscore T NS ta 0 0 1 8 4 2 3 2, and similarly this is another spreadsheet from your custodial file that we've modified to the extent that we excluded any states that were not Tennessee,okay, and are these documents that are normally kept in the course of Mount crops business of scheduling speaker series this would be a tracking tool yes that we would, this would be a tracking tool that we would use internally to identify which events were taking place in which state by which representative okay and looking at column 0, it's labeled h0n are here understanding is that an honorarium, that would be my interpretation of the correct, what is an outcome study,can you in context of, cific example sure I can pass you little B exhibit 26 which is M and K Dash t one underscore zero zero zero six five two four eight six four, thank you, I'm still on top of 24 IMS, okay and the question I'd ask you is what is an outcome study the intent of an outcome study is to determine whether we to measure whether we accomplish a result or not, okay and here you're seeking someone for an outcome study to determine what causes a change in patients Behavior to dispose of unused or unneeded prescription opioids objection to the scope, correct get the study when we were, looking through our medication pouch disposal initiative again going into patients homes to dispose of unused medications we try to understand, through messaging what we would say when these pouches would be distributed through community events to what would actually cause a patient to willingly dispose of their unused opioids so that we can be more effective in how these policies pouches would be used and did Mallinckrodt pay researchers for such a study, We There were times that we did yes paid researchers for studies, in the interest of patient understanding patient outcomes and what are their use them or not, what is the alliance for balanced pain management Direction Let's Go, the alliance for balanced pain management is an organization a coalition that was developed by Mallinckrodt in full disclosure with the with all the participants of stakeholder patient groups that have come together to identify ways in which we could expand access to a multi-modal approach to pain as opposed to having to rely on opioids and how do we advance, ants patient safety to dispose of unused opioids in the home once they're prescribed, and you said this was in full disclosure to all participants does this organization publish information, this organization did not publish well did not publish anything in its own name these were organizations that were brought together with their well they're full awareness that Mallinckrodt is funding and supporting this initiative this program has now since been turned over to a nonprofit organization to to manage does the what a member of the public know that it was funded by Mallinckrodt, objection but you can answer, we did not know no material was distributed to the public under the alliance renounce payment for pain management name but it had a website and there wasn't any way we were not trying to prevent anyone from that information did it disclose that information on the website I've had action I'd have to look at the website are you or are you still on the steering committee for this organization objection are you, and who's Bob twellman objection, Bob twill moon is dr. Tillman is the executive director of, what is now I believe the time was the American Academy pain management, and is he involved in the alliance for pain art Alliance for balanced pain management, he was I cannot speak to whether he is or not since we turned it over I don't have visibility to the membership of who's in there not okay, what is c pop, action, see Pop is the collaborative for Effective prescription opioid policies which is an organization based in Washington DC where similar scope to identify how as third-party groups we can continue to advance patient safety and effective opioid prescribing and who's the leadership of c-pop objection, the meeting the Coalition was convened by trust for America's Health the community anti-drug coalition's of America and former represent Mary Bono, and the community of anti-drug alliances of America is that the community community anti-drug coalition's of America from by General Dean, and who funds see Pop Church, Malik rap is a funder of see pump hey Thunder but I do not know their other funders if they have any, so is Mallinckrodt their primary funder objection we are funded but I do not have visibility nor do I know therefore total budget and does Mallinckrodt sponsor cadca Tony extent we do, another exhibit for you, 27 this is beit stamped mnk underscore T NS ta 0100 2290, you still talking 24 -,okay do you recognize that document I do is it accurate Direction, I mean it's a career it is to the best of the ability for me to remember what's on there, the bound caught have any expectations in return for funding these programs objection so scope in the form but, no now these programs for managed through our, advocacy initiatives to expand access to Patient treatment or to safe use for opioids at no time was any particular opioid our advancement of opioids discuss with any of these organizations that give you exhibit 28, which is bait stamped mnk underscore T NS ta 001 55119,thank you, okay, would you say, could you can you read the second paragraph of your response in the Sino, this paragraph is in context to the radio interview between dr. twellman and, dr. Claudie, and I stayed you'll notice that Bob's delivery of stats are statistics suggest pain patients have encountered access challenges as a result of the recent restrictions put in place at the federal and state level was less than overwhelming as Originators of the alliance I'd like to provide our alliance members so impactful stats that support the message so that we don't encounter these types of Misses again would that be an accurate expression of vallon crabs, mmm, objection, I do not want to say this is an accurate representation of Malin cross position this was my statement to provide to the alliance members, is it consistent with Mallon crops position, objection, Malik Wright has always advocated and taking positions that patients should have access to appropriate pain management so this statement of the statistics would be consistent with Malik rats understanding that patients who need appropriate pain management should have access to it, has c-pop held any events, objection could you specify when you say events what type of events sure if they have they done any informational presentations, objection to whom are you referring to do they held any events that are meant to inform, judging to my knowledge they have not had patient events they've had meetings at various conferences with third party groups that would be interested in participating to being part of the sea pup organization, do you recall a presentation in Nashville that was organized by pop objection, I recall there was invented Nashville but I'm not I do not recall who the organizer was I don't know if it will see pop or not, do you recall see POP holding your presentation or organizing your presentation on behalf of axial Healthcare objection, I would not, nothing comes to mind, how many, how many of these informational sessions for stakeholders would you say that see Papa's held objection, I wouldn't know the number, could it be one, would Jackson good be at least one yeah, do you recall see Pop putting on our presentation that focused on neonatal abstinence syndrome, objection I do not I do not know that word of it,moving to topic 26, earlier you testified in this area quite some time so just had some things I wanted to clarify, how does ballon crop Define health care providers, a healthcare provider would be in our opinion as someone as professional designation would pharmacists be considered healthcare providers, yes, an early earlier you referenced some materials being distributed at trade shows did prescribers attend trade shows objections go, I I recall that I spoke to material being distributed trade shows in both the generic and the brand could you specify which trade show, in general do prescribers attend trade shows, objection my understanding of prescribers would tend we use the is a broad term trade shows they would attend trade shows are organizations their professional associations that they would attend those show trade shows that but I can't speak to what other trade shows they may or may not attend, is pain we could trade show, I would classify paying week as a trade show does Mallinckrodt does Mountain krauts branded organization attend pain week we have, and does Malin krauts generics Department attend pain week I'm not aware that they would, they would have no reason to but I can't say that they've never been at it a pain week trade show does Mallinckrodt description distribute materials at pain week, within the within the confines of our of our company booth, are there any trade shows where Malin krauts generics Department presents or provides materials that prescribers attend, the generics team would prove would would have a booth Mallinckrodt booth at Charlie the wholesaler trade shows the HD a trait larger wholesaler distributor trade shows I'm not aware if they would attend any pharmacy our pharmacist trade shows but they should not be attending any physician, trade shows but I can't say that they want it they've ever did never done it before, we take a quick break sure",0.8464472702366863,0.54582584,0.9128387
jhdc0072,"there's the baron and we're going to show you a couple of things you saw that they had plenty of Castroneves out of the car this is has Castroneves was looking and getting the high side and then suddenly the engine let go, backed in big-time the report that we have from the scene still is a good report and we assume that they're merely taking care with him because the nature of the impact well we saw the same thing with Max Pappas earlier in the weekend that although he was reported to be fine they put him on the stretcher just make sure everything was okay they got it back to Medical for evaluation we certainly hope that's the same case with alien Castroneves and as you've said that's that's an enormous head like up at 225 227 miles an hour he didn't scrub off much steeple and I imagine top speed was, an excess of 240 miles an hour on the way in there because as I said earlier they're at full power they're now using all the revs engines have because fuel is not a concern he had a great draft from Radio coming down the front straight he went in there Full Throttle I mean absolutely flat out so that was just a huge hit it scrubbed off very very little speed 230 lamps Christian fittipaldi behind the pace car is the leader of the race green race average has been well up their average speed of the race with the yellows is it 150, .9 30 miles an hour fifty nine lead changes we've come in real close to that record of lead changes we're coming real close to the end of the race as well and we still don't have a championship decided though it looks very very good for de Ferran at this moment Parker but as we've seen with Castroneves and other Honda powered cars things could change quickly well if we look at the manufacturers Championship Ford had a huge lead coming in and looks like they'll clinch it here today huh, has been fighting all year long as we look at the cars that are now running we're looking at all four words and only Gil de Ferran in fourth place with his Honda engine all he has to do is make sure that he's right next to Fernandez he just in front just a position behind him for the championship if I were Jill I keep this thing in 6th Gear I breathe the throttle big time going down into turns 1 & 3 we know that Fernandez has not been happy with this car all day long and at the end of this the guys at the front whoever's the most trimmed out who can hold the throttle all the way to the floor the longest and still work a little bit traffic there, for the win look at the fair at all he's got to do is make sure this thing gets to the Finish Line frustrate Fernandez a little bit to Come Away With The Million Dollar Championship all right if the Ferran stays in fourth place Hernandez needs to move up 5 positions well he's going to need some serious help because on these on these super Speedways yes bravery does come into count yes driver skill car control you've got to have the car underneath you basically in order to do anything here if the car's not working there's nothing a, we can do to overcome that again to check in at Patrick racing Richter Brule just want to talk about the frustration down in 80 Fernandez's bit all these guys are out here watching car after Car drop out it's like watching musical chairs the only problem is the one guy they want to drop out till hasn't done it every time another car comes out like oh no why not that one, well attrition has certainly been a factor in this day hate cars left in the field now the last one to leave that of Helio Castroneves there's the top five pick names there in the battle of the championship is still on, it's definitely within his reach now though it's not yet decided but it looks very good for Gil de Ferran and the first championship still under the caution points as they stand right now gives Gil de Ferran the wind there's a million dollars on the line are gives still de Ferran the championship there is a million dollars on the line for that there are million dollars on the line for the race itself partner, I've been waiting for this all day politic Kurt's version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire we've seen a season where no one has wanted to come forward and dominate the Championship today looks like no one's wanted to win the race and looks like they're running out of Lifeline there's not much left time in this game and official from from part timing and scoring they haven't yet issued that one point for the most laps LED they're holding off on that Ian Vegas some interesting radio conversations and some discussions up and down Pit Road during the break we knew, that Jill the Ferrin was concerned about the speed of the restart that he did not want to be that slow he was in second gear then mysteriously Pete Twitty the representative for Marlboro Team Penske showed up at Christians fit they had a discussion and that was exactly what it was about they ask the Christian could you please pick up the speed we don't want to start that slow and other reports for Christians today his spotter is Walter Solace of course has done a great job behind the wheel of these cars as well so all the spotting for Christian fittipaldi, he is all done in Portuguese, another way to help us keep from knowing what's going on that's what we don't know what's going on anyway it's all like that makes it different I can't even get my word order straight out the lights remain flashing on the top of the pace car and the it's still a pretty expensive clean up that car when it backed into the wallet dropped an awful lot of oil gearbox Lube is well on the track and it's going to take them a while yet to clean it up there is Paul Newman that's the end part of the newman/haas racing a guy, who she just absolutely loves the racing and it's wonderful to see him here at the track all the time he makes every race he can movie commitments notwithstanding Rick dobrow I down here in Adrian Fernandez and fit the king of the strategist down here all the guys this is the team that can do it the best but the problem is now there's nothing left for you guys is there it's just you know race to the end we've got to do as well as we can do everybody's got enough fuel or but he got tires discussed at a trouble boss browse the team coordinator you guys say anything, the Adria not there to pump them up what do you talk to him about what we just talked about all kinds of stuff how the car is what you know what we're going to do if we need to make any more changes should we have to make another stop and just basically tell him how the race is going and keep going to do as well as you can do if you were a betting man at this point Would You Bet On It Now Bob's brow has been a long a very been around a very long time and knows the minds of almost all the owners and team managers up and down, rodent a little stint at Penske that gave him some insight there as well but now I think more than anything else Fernandez has cast his fate to the wind it depends on so very much that has to happen outside of his control when you look at the seven guys on the lead lap now fittipaldi has never won on an oval his only win coming at Elkhart Lake Roberto Moreno his first one came this year in Cleveland he's never won a on a super speedway Alex Barron he's looking for his first win obviously trying to revive his career, and find a ride for next year diferrent looking at the championship Casey Mears a great run but this is his first race so obviously this would be just huge for him Adrian Fernandez the only guy of this whole group who have won a 500 Mile ER then Alex tagliani he's been at the front several times this year he too could be in the mix because with this Hanford device if your car is working in these final few laps even if your back six or seven place you go right to the front but for Adrian Fernandez he's got to hope for a minor miracle here in order to Eclipse Jill de Ferran, Take the Lead the championship Elio Castroneves will be the last name to have been added to that cars out race and like out of the race graphic and that leaves us with eight now in the field are so Mark has is a Pious three laps behind the race but the remaining seven in front of him are all on the lead lap Christian fittipaldi it is his choice on how he wants to come back to the green flag he is the leader of the race the pace car has already begun, generating down the backstretch already the pace car is in turn three and getting out of the way fittipaldi has not yet tried to build the momentum up at all he maintains the same Pace down through the middle of the back stretch moving the car back and forth 236 laps into the record book will be on 237 what he's bringing around slow now he's got a great jump the last two times he may have done it again this time Paul he definitely going to get it this time the question is whether or not they're going to decide it was to spread out they did it once before no they say we're green flag we're, going racing Christian fittipaldi leads them to the line Moreno under attack by Alex Barron already at the fair in that you saw sitting back there in fourth place he needs to just stay right there and remember it was perverted Marine who gave Dale Coyne racing their best finish at the 1996 Michigan 500 and that was a third place and here's Alex Barron for Dale Coyne now in second, Huerta Ferran and Casey Mears and look back there is Fernandez it's desperate times for Fernandez now and he's not making any Headway into that group Jill the ferret is just got to keep this thing up in Top Gear breathe the throttle make sure the engine the rest of the car gets to the end Fernandez now actually dropping farther back that car is simply not working for him Paul and if the car is no good on a super Speedways it's a, a very very long day indeed but what goes on through the mind of Gil de Ferran you seen those other engines go he knows certainly that his May in fact be vulnerable, another engine goes in this time it's Barren everybody comes through the area of funding to start Finish Line and it stays Bright Now now it goes yellow Baron gets it off the track right at the end of The Pit Road and I've got to tell you as Fernandez came across the line right behind that he was on his brakes so hard that they were brought glowing bright red across the line the front brakes were just simply, it was plainly visible, here it is Jump before the line Rado goes through wisely Baron and skillfully gets it down does that somewhat dangerous transition between the bank and the flap of the warm-up Lane, and Adrian Fernandez he was behind all of this let's see if we actually got it on video because it was impressive this stands on the break there you go you can going yeah you said Paul doze off and fiber breaks they have huge operating temperatures Adrian Fernandez probably sucking at a lot are there and holding his breath as he came through, we're gonna there is Alex Barron what a great day he put in Somebody's gotta give this guy a good ride there's gone hopefully he'll be able to talk to him in a second we're going to want to show you this again with forehand is because it was something to see now watch as we transition from this outside shot to overhead you're going to watch the left front wheel but from the opposite angle you'll be able to see the brakes glow here now keep your eye on that left front will freeze it right here, and you can see it right there it is back it up if you a little bit there we might be okay there you go you can see it right there now the glow from that left front wheel of Adrian Fernandez just standing on the brake pedal and brake pedal all the way to the floor Christian's 19 consecutive laps in the lead the most consecutive lab that anyone has led today so we said it was going to be a Sprint before you bet it's going to be now, yeah and it's two races in a row for Alex Barron you were just telling me the last two races best car you've ever had yeah I mean if you have cars like this I just enjoy coming to the racetrack and driving the race car I just can't say enough for the team sports today Dale Coyne called the Great pit strategy I mean we're a lap down because we lost them ejectors yesterday and we're at lap down and today we had a great car and we just went right to the front and and I was going for the million bucks there at the end and it's just too bad I mean the, motor is really really strong and I really thought we could get this race you know that there was a lot of wet dry over there and turn to is a bit slick and after I got through there I know I could catch Christian and I get to you know run full rich and it's good it was good and you know I just hope I get a get a job for next year because I really want to do this I really had joined a driving a car like this we hope you get a ride as well thank you Alex and Dale Coyne is owner spent his time behind the wheel of a champ car as well off of the second turn, on to the backstretch Christian fittipaldi already the pace car is accelerated in fact it's way over in turn four and Christian is going to get that momentum again if he can place doing it again he's doing an SEC a Formula Ford start bringing him in a very very slowly trying to get everybody a little off Rhythm adding some throttle backing out when he thinks the whole field is D celled is going to plant his foot wave it off they're going to wave it off they're not going to accept this as a restart do and I tell you that's actually very dangerous thing to do, sitting out how much horsepower these cars have the Stager they have with a lock differential someone stands on it we've seen it throughout the history of Open Wheel cars someone's going to make a 90-degree left-hand turn and head right for the inside fence so they waive that one off Moreno is saw him poking out he was going to not be directly behind, Christian fittipaldi is a came back to ference it back in third place they come back to the flag and they've gotta have more speed they've got a gradually built the speed up if I were Moreno right now though I would let Christian fittipaldi have that kind of lead coming back to the green because even though everything's hunky-dory everybody's just kind of playing right now Christian fittipaldi at any given time might stick is put back in the throttle this guy's got a slowly build this feedback up have a nice safe start for the Sprint to the finish and looking up at the front of that field is this the day you want Ford power, well I want whatever is going to be running at the end with me at the front for a billion dollars yeah like I said car so Mark has by the way it's currently running seventh maybe looking at his best career finish but now the focus back at the front of the field as they like this start the green flag comes out Christian fittipaldi across the line followed by Moreno Alex take me on a takes a very close look at the fair and at the same time try, for a move on Fernandez no it does not happen that we suffered it is get around Casey Mears there's they came by but I've got to believe Adrian Fernandez is just hanging on for dear life right now but we've seen all day long is when these guys have geared up to go to the front has gone down a gear gone to full Rich we saw with Blundell as he just took the lead Michelle's heard a junior one Montoya we just saw with Alex parent the voters have not been able to stand the stress I tell you these guys now have got everything they have available their foot to the floor, to see additional engines go it's going to happen in the next few laps as we come to the checkered play last thing that the parent needs is the argue with Alex tagliani over something like third place the parent doesn't need it and shouldn't argue over it but what what it does overall in our Championship battle it it keeps the fair in there but it puts Fernandez looking at his rival right ahead of him, find to go now fittipaldi leads, there it is it's real it's real simple the parens where he needs to be Hernandez has got to start pedaling lands are going away for to go there's the championship battle fittipaldi is the leader Moreno is Second Son the simplest terms right now if the parent were to have a mechanical problem in DNA, deaf Hernandez would not only have to make up that distance to Where de Ferran was but also get to it passed tagliani that's not going to happen I'm afraid Paul his car is just not handling well said the Ferran has just got to lay back and hold his breath past who has trouble Casey mirrors just got around Fernandez Casey Mears now fit to to go to to go to the million dollars potentially for fittipaldi for winning the race, need to go for his first championship and the million dollars that a fair and we've got a car spinning a car into the wall tagliata angliana he had an engine let go just before it it looks like the game may be totally over tagliani catches the wall that was after he got around de Ferran it looks like Christian fittipaldi is going to score win number two until de Ferran is going to take the championship the yellow and the White Flag will come out at the same time Christian fittipaldi, baldy cross the line with two miles to go he's followed by Moreno tagliani against the wall that brings the fair and back up into that third place Casey Mears is going to come forward right behind a parent as well and Fernandez crosses the line with one to go knowing that his championship has just absolutely and totally gone away a little prematurely but it looks like a pretty good move they began to celebrate, down in the pens beep it's they're all up on the wall down so they can celebrate you can't take anything away from Christian here absolutely not he drove a great race he's now finally going to be able to take a breath get ready for his million dollar check and of course you'll de Ferran all these years of trying he's been so close he was a runner-up in the championship but now his million-dollar payday is come and all the bragging rights all the reputation that comes with being a cart Champion they are wonderful stories down the line fittipaldi with his second when Moreno, sitting up there in second place after the year that he has had up and down gave his first full-time ride a gate run but what about Gil de Ferran one of the nicer men out there he's quiet he's reserved very thoughtful in the all of the meetings who hear him in his very careful to pose his questions but he also wants to make himself quite clear and what a wonderful story for Casey Mears who is going to come home in fourth place in his very first, race in the champ car and as he comes to the line record number of winners in a season as Christian fittipaldi takes the win oh what a day and there is your new Champion there are a lot of people here with good reason to be happy the one who should be happy with a fit, it but will not be happy with the lack of Championship is Adrian Fernandez but there's still plenty to come from him with these two guys with the ferreted fittipaldi taking home two million dollars those are a couple of guys I'd like to party with the next week let's go to Young Beacon and Roger Penske getting the congratulations of just about everybody here congratulations Roger I know that had to be tough 500 miles and sweating out of Championship well lot going on out there today and everything worked out for us did a great job out belly OHS okay, what do you what do they do hey congratulations beautiful job last night I saw Roger at dinner and he wasn't smiling I don't think they were absolutely convinced that they could do this thing it's a very serious moment and I think he was holding his breath right until the last minute they consider the chance that Roger Penske took coming into this year we did away with the trade troop in ski Champion or a chassis that had taken to the championship at 94 they hadn't worked the last few years he went to retard chassis, switch from Mercedes to Hunter from Goodyear to Firestone hired two new drivers everything was new his crew is still there his engineering staff was still in place and they came for it to take his Hunter victory at Nazareth earlier in the year Castroneves and de Ferran also having individual race wins out throughout the year and here they are coming back to championship for terrific day for Ford Paul Newman and Carl huntz there on the jog down to the Winner's Circle because they have taken the last victory of this 2000 season, they are still working at Alex tagliani scar after this accident that brought out the yellow and ended the race with Dubrow when the team doesn't have a lot information the one thing they were saying is right before it happened he said I'm going to win this race I've got the car the situation obviously was going for it whether that had anything to do with this or with her sibling engine letting go or something else that says well well it sure looked like an engine letting go to us so we could see the engine let go oil the rear tires the difference between that and Max pad, offices accident it happened a little earlier in the quarter for tagliani the momentum instead of bringing them around towards the middle of the track like Max and them up into the wall room and heavy pot we're going to have bit of quality as they race winner Moreno and behold a Barren all right together there at the Winner's Circle let's go to Gary the moment here is you'll de Ferran thanks what is taking place a man we thought so many times about his great ability to focus to squeeze, hang out to try to treat the moment is just another race and today he has achieved the ultimate in open-wheel racing with this victory that gives him an Team Penske the championship it's a very emotional geography at this time they had announced that he was going to be making the switch that he would be coming to this team he was so excited now of course the great tragedy that cost the life of Greg more than a year ago at this Racetrack and put such a shadow and put relations in the plans for the team that is Jill said, it's here now we can clearly see him sobbing inside the car teammates coming over trying everyone to give him the space the time that he needs to reflect on this moment and as he works to gather his emotions will get a chance to share with him what it feels like he told us a year ago that it was almost a feeling that he couldn't believe to be going to the Penske team to be wearing the Marlboro colors that it meant so much to him as a young Brazilian inspiring to succeed in this sport growing up that that was, the level that he wanted to someday reach today is the day he couldn't celebrate yesterday it won't be a two million dollar payday but it is a championship that nobody can ever take away and it's a million dollars that goes with it to be awarded later this evening at the championship auto racing teams FedEx series awards banquet they continue to talk with him down here we'll check the final points on the season as it shakes out the Ferran with a championship Adrian Fernandez battling and he'll, only race car all day trying to hang on to finish second and it looks like momentarily now he'll is going to be coming up out of the car, what a time for this team they're worried of course about all the crush of people and cameras and reporters and crew members down here if trying to not do anything to the race car which will have to pass the technical inspection that should be a mere formality now the helmet comes off the Hans device that he was wearing head and neck shoulder restraint trying to help him in the event of an impact the adventures of all the other, Honda power plants today that made this one somewhat in doubt even though the final laps excuse me Pete let me get up here, there's nothing like it in all of sports I think the emotion is obvious you've had some time to try to collect material, the sink in that you've just achieved a dream I don't know yet if it's I've been all my life how many times this year have we talked about emotion in this sport how many times have we seen this play Angela his wife literally her body being thrown over the top of the car to embrace her husband and they share this magic time, beautiful we got a chance we'll ask him about the adventures of the day we think back and that one yellow flag when he was so very close from the contact involving Michael Andretti and the debris don't let's take you back just quickly if we can to that situation under yellow when you went through the smoke how close was it were you involved in contact was that the closest call of the day that day of the Lord was on my side today because I thought there, was it we were gone there was Smoke everywhere so Serbia it started to spin and then Michael appeared in the middle of the in the middle of the smoke and I was on the brakes off the brakes on the brakes off the brake and try to turn it down and they so very close call but it was a fantastic day for us today the car was really handling quite nice I just drove around the whole day just to try to wait to get to him how worried were you about being able to go the distance because of what had happened, the other drivers including your teammates with the Honda power plant this day oh you know we always knew that this race a kind of Separation filtration it's always difficult to get to the end that's what I was telling you about from when we started here and you know it prove prove that that proved to be the case today but you know they Honda and hold my breath in Paints the date they prepared these things like like have no idea everything run very very smoothly all day so how to pressure lifted off your shoulders, is now I don't know I know you wanted to have a couple of drinks last night it was postponed maybe you can have a couple now thank you the Vanderbilt cup the million dollars all to be awarded here's Roger Penske sharing the operation once again the emotion in Victory Lane, so congratulations to jail de Ferran his crew chief Matt Johnson who we've spent plenty of good moments this year teasing about in there is over Jill shoulder and the rest of the team of about the exuberance that they showed at the 100 Penske win and over the Finishing Line there are three Brazilian flags flying 18 for the top three positions Beyond beacons well we've been talking about a million dollars for the championship, million dollars for the winner of this race as well Christian fittipaldi congratulations was it actually a bit easier not having to worry about a championship no I have to say that the whole race was very difficult a lot of incidents you have to make sure that you kept your nose clean all the time we were running very conservative the the whole race because we knew we had a very good car for the last 50 laps and it worked out perfect but I have to admit that I looked out a little bit today there were a couple of incidents, that's that should have caught me out there and it didn't everything went my ways and then the same way I lost a couple of races I won this one so I'm very thankful especially to for that even though that we're not running with them next year they did a great job and they have been with Carl for a whole bunch of years now one of those scary times when Tony kanaan blew an engine you went through the smoke screen do you have any idea what was the on the other side 0 that was like that was a situation that I was very very lucky like, blew the engine I ran into his smoke and then he was very clever to slowly pull the car down and not stand on the brakes and I came out of the smoke very very lucky it's a banner day for the Brazilians a million bucks each Christian fittipaldi are 500 winner Rick well standing by with possibly the most frustrated man on pit Lane Adrian Fernandez and this was not the car you want it today no unfortunately not he was he was bad from from the start I mean we never managed to make it better, and you know you have too much push we anything we did to the Garden still got more push and then you know got loose a few times almost lost it and one of the restart and also the artists are having a misfire on the engine like meet through the race and I start losing some power and then he came back I thought you know I thought my day was over at that time but you know it was frustrating because I really couldn't you know I couldn't really attack too much but you stayed in there the Hope was there till the end wasn't oh yeah I mean you know, put on you have to be patience and see what you have I mean I was very close to put it on the wall a few times and you know just basically a warning that the car wasn't there so but you know I'm happy for the guys I mean this is a tremendous year for us is the best of my career and Patrick Patrick racing get me the best opportunity for engines say that there at the end and you know poetry we didn't have the car to give a run for his money to jail but you know well these are for him for the Penske team you know they were very strong all year but I'm very happy also, or my guys here all right great very gracious runner-up here in Adrian Fernandez, Adrian Fernandez does everything that he needs to do but it's not enough it's Gil de Ferran that wins the championship Christian fittipaldi he wins the race and put up a million dollars apparently heads over to the Winner's Circle so he can celebrate officially his championship here Alex tagliani was injured in that crash but they say they're not life-threatening we'll be back with more miles of racing and Jill de Ferran has his first championship, I enjoy driving because of the sensation of driving and I enjoy racing because I enjoyed the competition because I want to win, they scratched and they fought for each and every one of those points and at the final race of the season and the final minutes of the season the final mild there is how the final standings are in the cart FedEx championship series finishing second was Roberto Moreno here's gun yes with his wife Celia here in Victory Circle Roberto you had two jobs today you wanted to win the race but also you're trying to help Adrian Fernandez but look like his car maybe, he just didn't have it so then you were loose to try and win this thing well that's that's the name of the game you got to try to do it and I knew a 500-mile race it's the last thing that matters and if there wasn't a helical I was still hoping he'll have a shot at creation never mind it's great result for the visiting team and they great they got me from nowhere today all the way to Second it's just been fantastic and we had a good catfight towards the end so I'm very very pleased with everything that happened throughout the year with the visiting team, we had our ups and downs but we had lots of Ops and it paid off and that we put on the championship not bad for her what they call a full-time first-time full-time competitive ride so what's for you next year you've gone from 14 now third in the championship pretty confident for a championship next year well we're gonna have to push shop around to see where that would let end up as a drive but once that's over we were for sure land I think I will end a good drive for next year and, and we'll be strong in the championship are you joking or you do not have a ride with Patrick I'm not saying that I just say that I need to shop around and see what I get well what a way to end the season guys well the results are of course beneficial for a little while longer but I don't see anything that should be contested Christian fittipaldi of scored his second Victory followed by Moreno build a parent takes a point to the pole finishes third and wins the championship we're still waiting for any further details on the condition of Drive, over Alex tagliani will wait to get anything officially but the first report was it's good have injuries but they were not life-threatening there the unofficial results complete them for the running of the 500 at California Speedway, and we wait to hoping that we can give you the limbs of the trophies being present being presented to everybody there's the Vanderbilt cup it's already are ready to go let's go back to Gary pulling Shield Affair in literally away from countless interviews because the Vanderbilt cup awaits he steps outside the actual Victory Lane area and here is this beautiful gleaming piece of Hardware that is about to be presented the FedEx Series champion for the year 2000 Jo de Ferran doing it in, most dramatic fashion going down to the final laps because he takes possession a quick thought about the beauty of This Magnificent cup that's what we work our life is to touch this once you know what they're going to fill it up with a million dollars a little later tonight for you hey that's a bonus yes it is, interesting comment that the million

world the money is just an added sweet treat I listened ties the record also for the fewest number of cars running at the conclusion of a race, was a day of attrition it's been a season of surprises and wonderful season in the cart FedEx championship series this has been a presentation of ESPN the worldwide leader in sports for more log on to espn.com and as we leave here we want to review some of the Great Moments of this season past and tell you that this race team thanks to everybody here that it's helping these telecast to you throughout the year congratulations that Gil de Ferran and the, Austin fittipaldi, and the championship goes on the Fontana on this Ferry, afternoon Mike Tirico The Beatles 22 year old Pete Ham and Tom Evans and 21 year old Ron Griffis and Mike Gibbons look forward to the decade ahead blessed with creative cart blocks from the most artists friendly label in the music business Apple records they could just be as creative as they wanted they could try unusual ideas they could go into the closet and grabbed a steel guitar that Joy, George Harrison use I would be recording their voices and I look over and I had to make sure honestly that that John Lennon or McCartney didn't slip in that joining the backing vocals the voices were remarkably like the Beatles, in the last days of 1969 one of those voices was replaced due to Growing friction with Tom Evans original IV member Ron Griffiths would not share in bad fingers breakthrough Tommy created The Bad Blood he'd convinced the others at Ron's not one of the boys only more honor the baby from his wife Maureen and the baby was living in a band house Tommy's bedroom is right next door today is an EP cranking up music at 2:00 in the morning his attitude was well you know this is my life, you know you get on with it Tom pushed Ron out of the band and he was hastily replaced by a good-looking 21 year old from Liverpool Joey Malin the were working with the Beatles and my friends in Liverpool insisted that I go so I went down to see them and it was really as simple as that that's how I came to John it was arrogant and he had a Charisma about him and I mean amazingly good looking and talented to vote but, once they brought in Joey Mullen from Liverpool the band really fell together he was exactly what Badfinger needed with their new lineup in their first hit still climbing the international charts in January of 1970 Badfinger look to emerge from the Beatles Shadow as hit makers in their own right whenever they would go out and have press it would always end up that Beatles Beatles Beatles you didn't look at it like, it was a great compliment we took it the people meant we were copying, then that spring the beetle stunned the musical world on April 10th 1970 The Fab Four broke up the kings of rock and roll abdicated and Badfinger were suddenly hailed as the next Beatles uneasy where the heads forced to wear that Crown they were completely devoted to their music very focused on what it is they wanted to do and I don't think that really included being pop stars I think they were first musicians at heart Badfinger devoted themselves to the, according of their second Apple album in the summer of 72 impressed by their Studio work George Harrison invited Badfinger to back him up on his first solo album, by the Year's End Pete hams no matter what was their second top ten single their album was a top 30 hit Harrison solo album was number one and Peak Tom Mike and Joey were on their first US tour with superstardom in the offing Bill Collins in the boys knew they needed a business manager capable of handling High Finance and they found one in New Yorker Stan Polly there is no real, perfect my first impression is Stan was its powerful God he seemed like a real kind of dad kind of person who you know father person amongst an Polly's clients were musician Al kooper who founded the hit-making ban Blood Sweat and Tears and pop singer Lou Christie a major star in the 1960s there's no so impressed with it I mean whatever the man said he was very powerful and very persuasive somebody asked me was he okay I would say in that time, Polly laid out his plans for bad fingers financial future we would Bank the money we had we take a salary we would you save all the money you made from touring and hit records and then we'd have a substantial amount of money Badfinger trusted Polly to make them rich but 1971 found the band still living together in Bill Collins London house along with Mike's wife Gainer Tom's girlfriend Mary Ann and Pete's girlfriend Beverly was very much of, a big family atmosphere the bad finger household grew in January of 71 when Joey's American girlfriend Kathy moved into the house at golders Green these were like little boys living under the wing of this old mother and they were very very childish they had no clue about what they were doing because these guys had hit records and they didn't have a fridge and they didn't have a TV Kathy wondered why Joey and his bandmates were holed up in a cramped house while they're hits were on the radio and they were jamming with X Beatles, and that spring that worked on John Lennon's imagine album and that summer George Harrison invited them to play his star-studded benefit for Bangladesh where George performed a duet with Pete Ham miss the pink for him to be on stage with George George thought he was superb, while his Bangladesh duet with George had been a high point for Pete he was in a sober mood after breaking up with his longtime girlfriend Beverly, as usual Pete channeled his emotions into song, My February of 72 day after day was the number for song in America but day after day wasn't Pete's biggest hit song that month that honor would go to a ballad that Pete wrote two years earlier with Tom Evans without you but she's I just the killer song of all time, without you as a culmination of a friendship Pete Ham is versed gentle kind warm and then you have a chorus by Tom Evans extremely impassioned angst-ridden emotional that that's Tom Evans the extreme in March of 72 Harry nilsson's passionate cover of without, top the US charts and stayed there for four weeks, it had been two years since bad fingers breakthrough now there was only one thing that marred bad fingers two years of euphoric success we did not fancy cars we still living in the same friggin house for Christ sakes you know and Stan was like the man he was like taking care of business so we thought, oops despite the band's tight cash flow Pete Ham for one did not want to rock the boat it's not as if people are trying to screw us or anything or do anything like that I mean all the people who are associated with seemed really sincere are really sincere people amazing when it became obvious that's mr. Foley was concerned how you feel mr. Polly Pete just didn't want to believe it Pete was very trusting guy, I think that was probably part of his downfall in late 1972 bad fingers downfall was about to begin on the long and winding road ahead Darkness was looming coming off an album with a bullet shot down by lawsuits and he just whack it right off the shelf so it was the Dead with the death knows we've been right there and later Pete hams final fatal farewells done poorly is a soulless bastard and then, I will take him with me when Behind the Music continues what would it take to make YouTube VH1's artist of the month Jim Morrison's pants who read Shades Elvis's jacket um how about a brand new Pop-Up Video Legends and all of you choose best videos and maybe that's a bit much to ask the rock and roll group all November

movies on Pay-Per-View watch it your way, they had a lot of management troubles who were here about that always in the background you know sort of sad stories is often something that they're really dissatisfied with I understand of a lot of that, in the spring of 1972 Pete Ham song baby blue cracked the u.s. top 20 bad finger second big hit of the year, but bad fingers musical momentum would be lost for the rest of the year as their business manager stand poly sought to leave Apple records for greener pastures Apple did really well with bitching at but Polly couldn't get control of everything if he was able to take him to another company he could set up what he wanted and that's exactly what he did stand Polly refused requests from behind the music to tell his side of the story but by the fall of 72 Apple records was having problems of its own, I'm sorry but it's time to move away plagued by Bad Business decisions and Discord among the 4X Beatles apples utopian operation was in chaos waffle was a beautiful experiment that failed we wanted to stay with was Pete wrote the song apple of my eye was so you know it would all kind of brought down about it was a bit of a drag bit of a bummer we don't forget they took us from nowhere and put it somewhere despite their misgivings bad finger left Apple in, member of 72 after four years in the Beatles Royal Court Pete Ham Tom Evans Joey molland and Mike Gibbons found favor at Warner Brothers we felt it Badfinger with the right kind of production right kind of career development was worth the risk but before Badfinger signed with Warner's poly press the band to sign a new management contract Holly's business partner Stan poses didn't trust the New Deal I quoted a Peter and I quote up Tommy, I should my decision is I'm not going to be involved the situation go to your meetings next week and just refuse to sign any management papers poses had his reasons to break with Polly in July of 71 a witness in a federal bribery investigation testified before a US Senate subcommittee that Polly was well connected with organized crime despite poses warning Badfinger signed the new agreement with Polly and a recording contract with Warner Brothers in the fall of 72, to it would not be a happy marriage This Cloud moved in very quickly and hung over the band during almost the entire time I dealt with him at one of them's bad fingers final Apple album and first Warner Brothers album were released simultaneously it was just a mess for Badfinger by this point the stupid thing to do you don't put two records out at the same time you know fight yourself you're fighting everybody else Madness by the spring of 74 Badfinger had suffered, staggering reversal of Fortune bad management had not only killed their last two albums the salaries the band members were drawing barely kept them in guitar strings these people in those days made you judge money there was shoveling it in the Worland and getting dealt out there share with the tweezers of the other end the management team let them down especially stand Polly according to members of the band Polly was not delivering on his financial, mrs. they weren't getting their money they felt that they were trapped they had sold the birthright their talent the right songs and perform the band couldn't rely on manager Bill Collins for help nobody realize how fragile they really were they looked for bill for protection build let them down haven't went to dump Bill the other half didn't know you know Pete was so adamant he was loyal and it was misguided loyalty Pete Ham stubborn faith and Polly, Collins put him at odds with Joey Malin and his wife Kathy I took a jar of peanuts and I threw it at Pete's head I was so mad at him when are you gonna wake up and realize this guy is screwing you and started bumping with the pit and Joey big time you know and she acted Moon Pete we're beginning to waver he's losing his self-confidence he figured that he had no power anymore I mean to forget this is the Gathering, will have songs if you lose that trust between each other, then the band's no more it's gone isn't it you know and I know I know that happened to Badfinger gotta get as tensions within the band Rose in the spring of 74 Badfinger recorded their second album for Warner Brothers, bad fingers music shown through the Gathering Gloom wish you were here exceeded expectations what do you think we can look forward to in the future from Badfinger hit please after the Fiasco of their two previous records Badfinger hope their new album released in November of 74 meant to return to better days people like it the songs the sound it's going to be a, record for battery is going to be great and all of a sudden Warner Brothers pulled it having discovered that a 100,000 dollar advance payment was missing from an escrow account Warners stop distribution of wish you were here in mid-December and initiated a lawsuit against Badfinger Enterprises and Stan Polly should we not have full the album I don't know but at that point the legal department recommended that we do what we did and we did what they said was out of print so that was the death knell for the band, right there in reality Badfinger was already in its death throes frustrated by his battles with Pete Ham over music and management Joey Malin quit the band just as wish you were here was being released, less than a month later Polly pushed a bewildered Badfinger including new member Bob Jackson into the studio to make a new album and you'll have about two weeks to do and when we were all horrified stamped Bali he wants to know how them immediately so he can get his 250,000 dollar advance from Warner Brothers due to the lawsuit over the missing escrow funds Warner Brothers rejected the new record the fourth Badfinger album in a row that would fail to reach its audience just seemed a bandwidth she had a, Cloud over them from the moment we got involved with the black cloud hung darkest over Pete Ham by the spring of 75 Pete was living with an Ferguson and her young son Blair the couple were expecting a baby money was tight and the band was in limbo he said that point Still Still trust it Stan Paulie Pete tended to think that everyone in life with the way that he wasn't he had this trust and I'm at this point in time his girlfriend man, is pregnant you just got a house with a mortgage payment and we got no gigs we got no tools nothing we were like dead in the water you try to call America to stand poorly couldn't never could get him on the phone he would never speak to him nothing beats desperation began to manifest itself I saw Pete then the house put a cigarette out on his wrist and you have a scar now burn mark let's talk talk to my father, I'm in mind only suppose this situation man I don't think it's very good that's well everybody knows that just wait for you to realize here is an artist that is Worcester true honors who

and woke up alone she went down to the garage to see if Pete had worked late in his Studio, I knocked and then I pulled the door and then, and anything, hanging from a beam in the garage was the body

bad, Yahoo the bright promise of bad, finger had dimmed by the summer of 1975 bad luck bad management and bitter infighting had combined to wreck the hopes of a band once hailed as the next Beatles, broken financially and spiritually 27 year old Pete Ham had committed suicide that spring his friend and bandmate Tom Evans was devastated by Pete's death when it wrecked him you know for quite some time and I don't think he ever got over it was the pizza lost was a great strategy to him the surviving members of Badfinger drifted apart Mike Gibbons became a session drummer in Wales but by 1978 Tom Evans was out of the, the music business and so is Joey molland while Tom was insulating pipes and Surrey England Joey was laying carpet in Los Angeles a knock on the door one day there's a guy that'll teach you guys a tall guy undershirt go boss of Chicago they're my new band they tell me drummer Kenney Harkin guitars Joe Tans and we're devoted Badfinger fans they convince Joey to start a new band Joey invited Tom Evans to join them we flew Tommy how we rehearsed and it was it just clicked instantly, button Studio made some demos we got a lawyer the lawyer took the tapes to lecture and they listened to the first two songs of thing and said what do you want Elektra gave the band a big advance but demanded they call themselves Badfinger it was an ill Omen as the new Badfinger made their first album the old Jinx followed them into the studio from the, beginning it was a troubled project for Joey Malin and Tom Evans the trouble was drink and drugs drugs were around I think far too much time was wasted with them and the music became a little less important at that point substance abuse and musical disagreement undermine the effort and when are waves came out in the spring of 79 it flopped seen Tommy being bad finger without Pete was kind of hard I think Tommy was a lost soul, Tom and Joey made one last album is bad finger in 1981 and while whole Bond held on to a spot at number 56 on the singles chart that spring the album went nowhere the record company want us to go and do another record it was a to record deal so we go to the the rehearsal and the guy tells us I've only got half in the money and I told him I'd come back when the, you know when they had the money and I went home that's all you know all the guys all agree I thought we all went home while the next while the next day I was told that I'd left the band and that Tommy and and Tony went out of the band well I said all those guys then well Joey assembled his own version of Badfinger Tom accepted a touring offer from a Milwaukee promoter in 1982 and recruited Mike Gibbons and Bob Jackson to join his, version of Badfinger but before Mike and Bob could intervene A desperate Tom had already signed contracts with the Milwaukee Promoter on the Taman gillnet talmud sandeul is stuffed with publishing stuff management or you know the whole caboodle so tell me was I mean it was like all right Donald if I damage sign my friggin life away you know the promoter how's the band in a vacant model home in Milwaukee stuck Us in man so don't worry the kids are coming, but they didn't come my good buddy Tommy Evans Tommy welcome to Milwaukee we did one TV and shock horror and with a weird character called Toulouse turtleneck mcgibbon soon quit then a sad situation got worse as Joey Mile and moved to end the problem of two different dueling bad, singers the Clone The Musicians Union I told him my name is Joy Mullen I'm glad I've got my band budgeting and we're going on tour and there's another guy they're gonna have a band Badfinger know what I don't want them to be able to sign any papers he said okay we won't let him do any Union gigs go right now, and saying this is not real but by early 1983 Joey succeeded in stopping time from calling his band Badfinger Tom returned to London his wife Mary Ann and their six-year-old son Tom was dealt another blow is Joey Malin Mike Gibbons and former manager Bill Collins began pressing him for a share of the song royalties Tom had been receiving for without you but I guess that, according to Tom's former bandmates the members of Badfinger had an Unwritten agreement to split the royalties for all the songs they recorded together Tom focused his anger and frustration on Joey he broke the band up or it's a lot of things now it's over that your happiness is fitting now at the same time Tom was also being sued for five million dollars by the Milwaukee promoter, in an it get up at three o'clock four o'clock when he said what I'm going to do and like I'm gonna lose everything I can't even afford to pay the lawyer frightened and deeply depressed Tom Evans retreated into a fog of drink and drugs on the night of November 17th 1983 he made a frantic call to Joey molland he says could I do but the manager I said I don't know what else, get really angry with me anyways I'm gonna kill myself I said what are you gonna give me something to do tonight tell me what's way angry and upset and fed up and and Tommy only said I'd be dead before I get any money Marianne calm Tommy down and later that night he called his brother David he said yeah and Omarion's here with me now we're having you know a really good time and it was great to hear him sounding so what beat like that it's like it changed us, food from the phone call I was really really angry and suddenly he got into a happy mood again which was strange the mood swing the next morning Tom and Mary Ann six-year-old son woke up early Stephen came in a bedroom and he said where's Daddy then he went outside and, he saw his father and he said there's a man hanging there he looks like my dad, Stevens Father was hanging from a willow tree in the backyard a suicide at the age of 36, I can't remember what happened after that, I think they gave me an injection to sedate me for those close to Tom the news of his death was sadly familiar, I knew exactly what happened we just thought himself you passed it, Tommy would say one day I'd be up by Peters it's a better place than down here I kind of think that he felt if he went in the same way he would go to the same place, coming up what might have been with their talent and they'd be big today they be wealthy than be famous when Behind the Music continues she married her manager yes is much older than me was afraid

honey would you grab that laundry for me honey throughout history many people have had great ideas but very few have had a place to take them now every person has a place to help develop protect and even sell their ideas large and small no matter what you do, do the way I always saw Badfinger was they were a classic English pop band joyous exuberant lyrics Type ride harmonies immaculately produced Arrangements all jammed into two minutes many years have passed since the tragic suicides of Pete Ham and Tom Evans but bad finger is still being discovered by a new generation of fans, in 1994 Mariah Carey hit the pop charts with her cover of Bad fingers classic song without you written by Pete Ham and Tom Evans the next year the songwriters Association ASCAP honored without you as one of the most performed songs of 94 Joey Malin Mike Gibbons and former manager Bill Collins attended the ceremony as did Mary Ann Evans and her, 18 year old son Steven but on what should have been a triumphant night Badfinger seen jinxed again oil went up on the stage to pick up these Awards and they said they announced it right I did and writers Peter home tell me I'm enjoying Mullen Mike Givens Bill Collins I didn't know it was going to say I wrote frigging song like that I mean I think that I wouldn't have turned out if that was the case everybody knows p.m. and tell me what that song I was disappointed at Five Guys Go on stage and two guys who wrote the song ever since then you know, it's been the story to join - he wrote without you which is bullshit when we got the award I felt great about it and it wasn't wasn't for me it was cuz the song had won the award and I thought that was a great achievement I thought was great the controversy at the ASCAP Awards was another example of bad fingers emotional Legacy of sadness and song Today Joey keeps the songs alive as he tours with Joey molins Badfinger if I don't do them who the hell else is going to do those things you tell me, you know who else is going to say this is a pizza ham Seung this is a Tommy amundsen that's what I do at my shows still have to use the name Badfinger can't get gigs on there and enjoy moments and possum ate like 50 bucks a night you company the gas out of 50 bucks a night For Better or Worse music not money came first for the members of Badfinger and their memorable catalog of song was recently celebrated in, election of their greatest hits released by Capitol Records in the fall of 2000, what a more intimate note to recent CDs feature demos of songs Pete Ham worked on during his long nights alone in the studio Philip back of the old demos everybody's I mean moaning and groaning and he's saying it's sweet and I'm saying he was a Melody man those Melodies continue to haunt Badfinger fans along with Bittersweet thoughts of what might have been you have a record deal The Beatles are backing you up you're on the record label, but look what happens when you have bad management doesn't matter just goes we wish we could have stopped them you can't stop certain things and then just had to run its course the talent is unbelievable is songwriters Pete and Tom would have just been they would have been lennon-mccartney team eventually there was so much more to be done with that group so much further to go these were kids that were bamboozled, it's a shame things like this happen in the record business well you've got to get a lawyer you know that you've got to read these Concepts we we never read a contract and I live perhaps the real tragedy of Badfinger is not that they never became the next Beatles but that they barely had a chance to be Badfinger when we lost Badfinger I think we lost innocence you know they weren't expecting millions they just wanted to go out and play the songs and for the public to hear them they enjoyed that a lot, show me the way I set you free what you want to be if you missed one second of Badfinger Behind the Music catch it again tonight at 9:00 8:00 Central Celine Dion Behind the Music is next on VH1 it's not, baby you and I my baby, she Rose to fame at a heart-pounding pace Celine Dion is the Cinderella of pop it's a fairytale but it's also a work ethic she set the charts on fire with her torch songs it seemed everything saline touched turned to Gold I think there are great singers I think there, great performers think they're great vocalists, saline and bodies all of it she's a consummate Entertainer, in less than a decade Celine Dion sold over 100 million albums making her the best-selling female artist of all time Salinas said some kind of new precedent for female singers I mean practically every Young singer that I mean they want to be saline cause I'm Yours, she did make the climb alone Celine had a guide all the way to the top Rene angelil six months approximately after I met her I decided to concentrate only on silly does I saw that she had everything to become a huge star after nearly 20 years their partnership seemed indestructible but then they learned Renee had cancer when it hits you it changed your life forever, it changed Renee's life it changed mine confronted with the sobering reality saline abandoned her career to care for her husband I used to be in love with her more than everything but now there's not a word that exists that can Define how much I love we've had a message sending to us so we're going to stop this show business life now from her humble beginnings to her dramatic departure, Archer Celine Dion the story behind the music, December 31st 1999 with the century about to turn in a New Millennium about to begin Celine Dion return to her native Canada to ring in a very special New Year, for Celine and her fans the much-anticipated concert in Montreal was a Bittersweet celebration both a joyous homecoming and a heartbreaking farewell for this event was marking the end of an era Celine Dion's final public appearance you think you're all kind all kinds of weather or Mount which would allow access War at the age of 31 the reigning queen of, the recording industry was stepping down walking away at the height of her success to dedicate all of her time to the love of her life Rene angelil you I grew up in front of him and we kind of, grew up with each other in a way since Celine was just 12 years old Renee has been at her side guiding her Ascent to the top of pop and it seemed their charm partnership would go on forever but then in April of 1989 doctors discovered a tumor on Renee's throat, let me get to the point cancer it's never part of you but of your vocabulary it's not for you, that's for the others I'm in Show Business you know I'm all right you're wrong when it hits you it change your life forever it changed Renee's life it changed mine, this last year I went through a difficult time I had to add some treatments of radiation and chemo and 38 treatments and she was with me for the 38 treatments and she supported me like you wouldn't believe facing the possibility of losing her husband and partner saline came to a sobering realization one that forced her to re-evaluate, at her life and career this has been my life in here, for 18 years, but there's a whole me, there's a whole me where I need to express myself I need to give something back I need to be with my whole family mystical so with a new sense of purpose saline said goodbye to one life and embraced another this show business life which is great fun only great fun but it's time for me now to make a difference I can't sing love songs on my life, I need to make love I need to share love I need to make a difference celine's Devotion to family was instilled in her long ago as a young girl growing up with Big Dreams in a crowded house Celine Marie Claudette Dion was born in March of nineteen sixty eight the youngest of 14 children the Dion's lived in a four bedroom one bathroom house in Charlemagne Quebec Canada a quaint Village, east of Montreal the way that I grew up, was the best way the cooking of my mom a small house with three four people sleeping in the same bed and lots of happiness but with little or no formal education celine's parents struggled to make ends meet my dad worked all his life to make a little bit of money and to bring the food and table and I'm very very proud of my mother she raised 14 children by herself with nothing but an old house there was nothing brand-new, it was no new furniture and the ceiling was so low that I could touch the ceiling and we never had money there was never much money but there was always plenty of Music in the evenings the family gathered in the cramped basement of their tiny home to play and sing I couldn't wait to hear them they were playing music in the basement of the house every single day she grew up in the music business because, I have so many brothers and sisters singing or playing instruments even my mom and dad at this Amy said in the age of Two and a Half saline would sing We had her sing children songs and then at five she started to use a microphone to sing she really liked that Army Corp shall be at the tender age of five Celine made her public singing debut at her older brother Michelle's wedding saying on three songs in a row everybody was like wow not the family, lie about the guess was like your sister sing very well and you know was excellent in 1978 after saving for years selene's father bought a local pub 10 year old saline jumped at the chance to perform for the patrons but soon her mother banned her from the bar it was probably the worst day of my life then, yeah but mama and she said I want you to sing Salon but I want you to sing with your own songs and I want you to have a professional and she have career and international career celine's Mother Teresa was so determined to see her little girl succeed she wrote her a song it was her first attempt at writing but the simple tune called it was only a dream launch celine's career pick event detection I wrote lyrics and I asked my son Jacques to put it to music sucks and it goes like, is the coffee shop down shorty to Deku sugar-sweet with two very first song that my mom's wrote me started my life, got me here today so they can never be a more importance on the family recorded Celine singing the song and sent it to Rene angelil a well-known manager based in Montreal Renee was on the verge of leaving the music business forever but his plans changed when he heard celine's tape, what struck me was the the way she was singing the feeling the voice came straight from the heart actually I didn't think she was 12 years old that's why I wanted to meet her in person to find out one listened to the tape and Renee was on the phone to celine's parents and within our Celine was on her way to Montreal though she lived only 12 miles away it was her first trip to the city, you he said well sing said normally have a microphone when I sing well for him this was kid talk because there was nothing to hook up a microphone to so he gave her his pain and he said try to pretend this is your microphone and sing so she took his pen and she began to sing she changed completely, so even though she was only 12 years old and she was saying with all her heart and I had never seen anything like that so she made me cry actually when she was singing and I looked like my mom and I knew that this moment was going to change the rest of my life and then the dream started and actually it's a fairy tale it's a dream come true, into your next in unexpected turn of events you kissed me goodnight on the lips and it changed my life no was asking myself what am I doing, and later saline raises the Titanic when every hair on your body stands up like you know you've got something here well by the end

from the music business then as you lie I'll audition to 12 year old name Celine Dion, and both of their lives were forever changed I want to right away doing album because I was so sure of our talent I'm a gambler you know more often I'm wrong than right but that time I was right Therese Dion agreed to let Rene manager little girl but made it clear she would be with saline every step of the way, the exact tomasa Celine recorded her first album in the fall of 81 suddenly she was a star in Quebec with Renee at her side Celine was convinced she'd make it big in music she quit school and never look back, by the age of 15 she was touring the world but saline always look forward to coming home and spending time with her family especially with her sisters little girl Kareem who is suffering from cystic fibrosis, Corrine was often hospitalized so whenever possible saline would visit and sing for the children in the ward every time I went to the hospital and and meet sick children or sink for them would take their hand or spend a couple of minutes with them makes me realize how lucky I am how life is precious and how strong they are, singing to Kareem Celine discovered the power of her voice how through song she could truly connect with people, I'm touched when I sing the lyrics are moving me and I always hope that these words will travel as deep as the other person's heart and that they will feel what I'm feeling by 85 it seemed all of French Canada was in love with saline she recorded no fewer than seven albums been showered with Awards and had even perform for the Pope, but it was the King of Pop That gave saline her greatest thrill inspired by the Michael Jackson phenomenon she set her sights on a new goal conquering America he said to me he said you know I see myself there with them so I said okay let's do something we want to stop for a year you go back to school you learn how to speak English, and once you know how to speak English I will get you a deal for an English recording with a major record company but Celine didn't need a year she learned English in just two months corresponding the corresponding corresponding that's right I was very proud of her and I made good on my promise in early 86 saline dropped out, out of the public eye and for the next year and a half she polished her act preparing to invade America each and every step along the way Renee was there guiding celine's career but after years of working so closely saline found herself falling for Renee I just trusted him I wanted to be with him I felt good and secured with him, I loved him I was probably in love with him the first day I met him without knowing it's it's all right little said this much is true despite celine's desires the relationship remains strictly professional then in the spring of 88 Saleem was in Ireland competing for the prestigious Eurovision award this is Celine Dion congratulations after the event Renee is scored its lean back to her room and like, he had so many times before he kissed her good night it was suddenly a different kiss good night it was different he kissed me goodnight on the lips and he changed my life I was asking myself what am I doing but love you read that in books you see that in movies you know that love is bigger than everything I sat on the edge of the bed and, I could die and I didn't know what to do I didn't, but I knew it was right and it was the man of my life I knew I was going to marry him and make love to him the first time I knew that was it they were reluctant to tell celine's mother about the relationship the knew they couldn't hide their Affair for long we're coming you don't realize they were having an affair but it took a while for him to confess so I confronted, him about the situation and tried to how should I say set him straight oh yeah you can believe that she had a heavy thought with me her mother eventually they won the blessing of celine's mother however saline had just turned 20 Renee was 46 and the new couple wasn't so sure the public would be so accepting so they decided to keep their love affair a secret from the world, inspired by their Newfound love they went to work on celine's first English album we will Unison was released in April of 1990 and soon after the single where does my heart beat now shot to the top of the charts she had achieved the ambitious goal she had set for herself only two years earlier Saleem had become a mainstream pop, now she was eager to publicly Proclaim her love for Renee but she would have to wait coming up Dion the diva becomes the target of a late-night Lampoon I am the best singer in the world, but first saline says goodbye to her angel she put me in contact with heavens and that is probably the biggest gift that somebody can give his love when Behind the Music continues and the Stars, One Man in a league of his own one man has won the hearts of millions one man has changed the game forever Will

Cuisine the Druid restaurant at 120 Bedford Street Stamford Connecticut, in March of 91 Celine Dion accomplished a lifelong dream she had scored a top 10 hit in the US then she Unleashed a monster hit with the title track for Disney's Beauty and the Beast when Celine first got to the stage she was in her early, 20s she had dark perm heavy eyebrows and looked like a kid more or less people didn't really understand who she was at that point, Beauty and the Beast came along and I think that was really the Breakout song where people started to associate a name with that voice and certainly with that song Celine spent the better part of the next three years touring the world basking in her Newfound Fame while she was rarely home or family was never far from her heart then in May of 93 Celine received an urgent call her young niece, being was losing her battle with cystic fibrosis Celine rushed back to Montreal to be with her the day that I got to the hospital on my way back to the tour she was at the hospital for many days and the doctors stopped me and she said I think that she's going to go today Celine cradle Kareem and like she had done so many times before sang to ease her nieces pain and I started to play with her hair like this on the side and I, I started to sing softly to her inner ear precious one it's very very sweet song and I saw a little tear coming down her cheek cross over to the other Shore moments later Kareem passed away she was just 16 years old don't waste, having my niece died in my arms, was the greatest gift of all, because, she felt good enough in my arms to let go and I could sing to her soft and she brought me with her in a way she put me in contact with heaven was and that is probably Heavens love the biggest gift that somebody can give you the passing of her niece, reminded saline just how fleeting life can be, and now she was no longer willing to hide the one thing that meant the most to her her love for her manager Rene angelil you but Renee still feared that celine's fans would reject her for loving a man more than twice her age for a few years with in tell anyone and that was my idea she wanted to tell everyone but I was afraid that the fans won't accept that Celine had never questioned Renee's judgment before but she could no longer, Unger abide by his decision you keep asking me do you have a boyfriend you have a boyfriend and I keep hiding it and no no I don't have a boyfriend and I'm the person who's so much in love I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't take it anymore, he will be Renae ran their business Affairs but saline asserted control over matters of the heart and she was determined to have her way I couldn't do like a press conference and say okay listen I'm in love and he's the man open curtains so she took matters into her own hands in November of 93 saline proclaimed her love for Renee in the liner notes for her CD the color of my love, I didn't know whether to say you shouldn't do that and I figured if I say that it's gonna hurt her if she decided to ride it and it's time to Renee's the man of my life so I have nothing to hide think of be ashamed of yes he's much older than me, but there's no way age, Renee's fears were unfounded in fact once the relationship was made public fans embrace the cup, in the winter of 94 6 years after their first kiss Selena and Renee were married held in Montreal's Notre Dame Cathedral the grand ceremony resembled The Royal Wedding all of Canada watched is the couple exchanged vows on National Television we usually would, it was like for 500 people and the whole country was a witness of this wedding was a big Affair beautiful church and a great day beautiful ceremony after and they will never forget there were nights when the wind, the newlyweds went right back to work by the spring of 95 they were recording her next album falling into you and soon were embarking on an ambitious World Tour I'm amazed at how saline can continue the kind of schedule that she does she's sort of like the Energizer you know I think it comes from all of the support and affirmation that you got as a child, Selene work ethic is near perfect probably the best I've ever seen in terms of her wanting to get that vocal okay let me try one more time get him a time when you've worked every single day for life since you were 13 there's a tremendous amount of discipline that goes into it, Celine had been a star for years but there is no way she could have been prepared for what was about to happen falling into you Celine Dion when falling into you was released in March of 96 it became one of the biggest records ever incredible, it's sold more than 30 million copies worldwide produce three hit singles and earn saline two Grammys you know I first of all I would like to thank my parents and my 13 brothers and sisters so every time I'm performing and every time I'm doing an interview every time I'm traveling the world there with me and they're in me and I think of them and I do it passion for with so much passion because I love them very much, so I do it for me because I love doing it but because I love them very much and I do it for them to she left home at the age of 12 to conquer the world of music now it's 28 saline long for a family life like the one she left behind somebody loves you more than

jhhb0039,"I'm very glad to have this opportunity, 200 need to talk to you today as we wind down 1991 and get ready to begin a new year it's been an exciting year for tobacco International and I want to use this time to bring you up to date on our business how we fared over the last 12 months and where we're going in 1992 it's no secret to anyone here that the entire world is changing faster than we can keep track of and the pace of change in the international tobacco business is in many respects even more, Ematic just a few years ago it would have been a rarity to see American-made cigarettes in such countries as China Poland or the USSR but today camel Winston and Salem as well as our other International brands are not only available but are growing in popularity among smokers in these countries to put it in perspective just five years ago the international tobacco companies had access to only a little more than 40 percent of the total world, Market today that number is 90% And still growing, total access to most of these new markets is by no means complete but the market dynamics are clearly on our side with the World Market growing at a 1 to 2% a year and more and more smokers turning to high quality American blend cigarettes, what this means then is a whole new playing field for RJ RTI it means vast new markets and several hundred million potential converts to RJ Our Brands but it isn't going to be easy intense anti-smoking activities higher Taxation and sharply increased competition are just a few of the critical issues that make our business more difficult than ever before, despite these issues I believe we have what it takes in our strategies are Brands and our people to be a winner certainly our performance backs that up in 1991 a worldwide volume grew 23% to 135 billion units and we racked up share gains in 17 of our top 20 markets earnings for the year were up 21% reaching five hundred million dollars this is almost double, our earnings in 1988 the year preceding the KKR by out and cash flow increased to 186 million dollars some 50% over plan and almost three times as high as a year ago this growth has been broad-based and balanced both geographically and by product line in Europe unit sales grew 25% and earnings increased by more than 11% in Asia, was up 12% with earnings growing 38% in the Americas we held our own with volume for the year up 2% and earnings up the strong 15% the Middle East and Africa rebounded nicely on the heels of the Gulf War with unit sales growth the 45 percent for the year and earnings up 80%, the US export component of our business has been particularly strong exports from Winston-Salem were up 30 percent this year this growth in exports has been more than sufficient to compensate for us volume declines and to keep domestic plants operating at high levels of capacity utilization and efficiency, at the Brand level we continue to focus our marketing efforts and resources behind camel Winston and Salem three of the top 10 best-selling brands in the world and the backbone of our business all three brands have responded positively to imaginative and impactful marketing programs and have your marketing investment our top priority brand camel for example was up eight percent for the year with substantial increases in its key Western European markets and doubled, good growth in all geographic regions as our only Global brand camel is supported with the consistent theme in all of its major markets the print ads you're seeing here are representative of camels worldwide image of masculinity adventure and Independence will continue to reinforce this image with programs such as Formula One racing where we had an excellent performance this year and camel trophy which we've made part of our trademark diversification company, any to protect the event against advertising and promotional bands Winston our second brand priority doesn't lend itself to a unified Global advertising approach like camel so for Winston our strategy is to work within regionalized campaigns as the basis for leveraging the Brand's grow Winston's appeal is based on its top quality American brand status and it's linked to contemporary young adult Lifestyles this positioning along with the Diversified and, effective marketing program resulted in a volume increase of 13% for the year reflecting Winston solid performance in the Middle East Iberia and our worldwide tax-free business, Salem the world's best-selling menthol cigarette continued its strong upward Trend with sales growth of 16 percent a good indication of the Brand's increasing popularity in Asia where it registered share gains and all of its core Asian markets Salem also has growth potential outside of Asia in markets such as Mexico Puerto Rico and tax-free and we'll be giving it the necessary support to grow in these markets, our other International and local Brands play a key role in rounding out our business as well as helping establish a presence in new access markets for the year these other brands grew more than 60 percent so that's the good news about our performance for the year but 1991 has been an eventful year in the number of other respects we've restructured our organization by creating a new geographic region and several additional strategic business units to better manage our, growing business and we've reassigned some of our senior managers so that we can use their skills and experience where it'll do the most good we've also done an outstanding job in getting the most from our manufacturing facilities over the last three years our sales have grown 40% while manufacturing capacity is increased by only seven percent we manage this additional production by increasing capacity utilization at our own overseas factories, from 72 more than ninety percent increasing productivity some 30% in the process and the quality of our products has also improved with customer complaints down this year by 15% externally we scored several victories in our efforts to protect our operating Freedom against higher taxes and advertising and promotional bands in Hong Kong for example we were instrumental in getting a massive tax hike rolled back by, half and in Canada were smokers have been bombarded by higher taxes some 4 million protest cards have been mailed to the Prime Minister perhaps our most critical Victory this year however was the Court ruling in Canada which declared that the Canadian add ban was unconstitutional and a direct infringement on freedom of speech we hope that this decision will have an impact on other courts and governments that are considering similar bands, by far the most important development for our business this year has been the opening of several high potential new markets in particular the Eastern Bloc countries were some 700 billion cigarettes are smoked annually are special interest to us and the Soviet Union the third largest cigarette Market in the world will soon complete our 14 billion unit export order and we're optimistic about following orders given the Soviets chronic Supply shortage, at the same time we're also working directly with several of the Republic's to explore the possibility of producing locally through joint ventures the going will not be easy in the Soviet Union the lack of hard currency coupled with massive political and economic obstacles make the Outlook extremely uncertain but the potential is sufficient to justify the investment risks and we fully intend to stake our claim in this massive Market, in Eastern Europe our priorities are Poland Hungary and Czechoslovakia and Poland we were the first form cigarette company to produce locally who began manufacturing camel and Monte Carlo for the Polish market in November and we're in the process of building a new 30 million dollar Factory near Warsaw in Hungary were negotiating for controlling interest in one of the leading manufacturing companies this is a competitive tender and we feel that we have an edge in, the bidding process and in Czechoslovakia we're looking at a license initially followed by Equity ownership in one or more factories and brands are development activity isn't confined to Eastern Europe in Turkey are number one development opportunity in Europe we're looking at sites for new 50 million dollar manufacturing operation and if everything goes according to plan will begin production in 1993, in Asia will continue to invest aggressively to support the growth of our International brand franchises in Japan Korea and Taiwan the newest development opportunities for us and this region are Thailand and Indonesia in Thailand were importing and selling Winston-Salem and why a cell and in the huge Indonesian Market will soon be making and selling camel Winston-Salem under new joint venture agreement, Mexico also promises to be a dynamic market for us we just launched Winston and the growing International segment of this market and will be relaunching camel and Salem under a joint venture agreement with LA Moderne the market leader, I've touched on just a few highlights of our new business activities all of these markets is they become fully developed will complement and rounded or existing business giving us greatly increased potential for profitable growth are excellent showing this year was not achieved simply by accident or good luck our success is driven by precisely formulated and realistic strategies that have stood Us in good stead for several years these strategies will remain much the same for the future, with modifications where necessary to reflect changing conditions the most important change by far is the increased emphasis on business developments let me quickly highlight these key strategies for you we will invest heavily for business growth will continue our focus on Europe and Asia, we'll continue our emphasis on Camel Winston and Salem, will expand manufacturing capacity and continue to improve the quality of our products we will deliver strong earnings and cash flow growth will fight against government imposed restrictions on our business will ensure that our organization is properly structured and finally as I just noted we will be taking a very aggressive posture to capitalize a new development opportunities in combination these strategies provide the, Ellen of a clear and single Focus for the company and simultaneously the flexibility to adapt our tactics to a changing environment our underlying business is very strong and we've got every reason to be optimistic about our prospects for the future, perhaps the best indication of that optimism is the fact that we've just upped our performance standards from 6 to 10% for sales from 17 to 20 percent for earnings and from 25 up to 30 percent for cash flow growth, these are ambitious objectives but objectives that I believe are achievable based on industry potential and our strong underlying growth momentum, here are some of the reasons for my confidence we have a strong existing business and we're making good Headway and developing a solid base and a number of new opportunity markets in camel Winston and Salem we have three brand with broad worldwide appeal, we have a strong combination of other International and local Brands allowing us to appeal to a wide range of consumer preferences we have the proven marketing expertise to stand Toe to Toe with the strongest competition we have the ability to generate internally the financial resources necessary to invest heavily where investment is Justified we have a scope of operation broad enough to provide a buffer to drastic downside changes, individual markets we haven't experienced and capable management team and finally we have a foundation of consistent strategies which guide our business in which have been validated over time, these strengths provide a certain predictability for our future no matter how unpredictable the environment Maybe, there's another good reason for my optimism and that is the professionalism and dedication of our employees the quality and commitment of our Workforce is second to none next year will be an even bigger challenge as we expand our business into the many New Growth areas but no matter how tough the months and years ahead maybe I'm confident that we have the people and that all-important Spirit of teamwork to maintain the enviable track record we've established, established over the last several years, so I want to take this opportunity to thank each of you personally for your efforts and important contribution to the success of our business we've done well in the past few years but the best is yet to come I'm proud of our performance and extremely proud of you and all the ti employees who made it happen, and with that I'd like to take this opportunity to wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year",0.8479560632499998,0.73533946,0.91283834

jjhb0039,"Betty this is money line with Lou Dobbs for Thursday September 10 1987 good evening seen in business news has learned that the RJ Reynolds tobacco company has created something soft by the tobacco industry in this country for years a so-called smokeless cigarettes sources say the company is expected to claim next week that it has mastered the technical problems that will not enter production until the winter Steve Young is here tonight, he has the story State blew the smoke crowded in secrecy for more than a year even the name of the product is still a mystery the company reportedly has at least two names and two packages in order to keep it that way there are indications that RJ Reynolds is advancing the announcement because it believes that with the fabrication of production Machinery too many employees are learning details to keep the project quiet Reynolds also reportedly is concerned about potential competition in the race for the smokeless cigarettes, another type of smokeless cigarettes based on polyethylene laced with nicotine was tested in the San Antonio area the company Advanced tobacco products incorporated is now defunct because the Food and Drug Administration wouldn't approve the product the FDA can take action against a cigarette containing no tobacco but ironically it has no say over a so-called smokeless cigarettes if there's tobacco in it and there is tobacco in the Reynold cigarette butt, is it really smokeless experts say that's impossible when tobacco and cigarette paper both vegetable matter undergo less than complete combustion which can only be achieved in pure oxygen so how will Reynolds do the seemingly Impossible by using special paper and altering the tobacco the company could create smaller smoke particles which would not scatter blue light that would eliminate visible cigarette smoke smaller particles would scatter ultraviolet light which, is invisible to the eye it's believed to be a vote are reduced nicotine product artificial fragrances would mask the smell of the smoke artificial flavors would make it taste more satisfying, if that's what RJ Reynolds means by a smokeless cigarette the product could blunt criticism of smokers but wouldn't prevent their smoke from subjecting non-smokers to rotation and the risk of disease and ETA expert Lou says the RJ Reynolds announcement is likely to be a major public relations coup that could Cloud the issue of indoor pollution RJ r-- Vera reaction to all this well as you know we sought their reaction for hours and shortly before, we went on the air we got a callback finally from their senior vice president who said that he would neither confirm nor deny our story but there was a decided smile in his voice and when I said oh we invited to the announcement next week he kept smiling I mean laughing almost in the background okay say thank you well an important ruling today in Washington could have fact phone customers the seven Regional phone companies the baby bells winning only a split decision from the judge overseeing the ongoing, example of Marbella but the decision could crack open the door on a five billion dollar market Tom Cassidy reports from New York the 222 page ruling will eventually have a powerful impact on at least two businesses answering machines and security systems but it also bridles the ambition of regional phone companies to compete with AT&T in a new information age I think the ultimate impact is on the consumer that many of the benefits of the information age, may not be available to the consumer in the kind of time frame that we had hoped we could assist in that process specifically judge Harold green orders the baby Bell phone companies to stay out of the long-distance phone business and the

moneyline if you've been doing a lot of trading but don't think your broker is doing you right you're in luck the Securities and Exchange Commission wants to make sure that your gripe about your broker is treated fairly today Commissioners took a vote a vote that could change the way disputes are handled double Martini has the story from Washington the SEC, see moved to eliminate possible abuses in the system for settling disputes between stock Brokers and their customers the move coming after the Supreme Court affirmed in June the customers who sign arbitration agreements can't sue their Brokers that the relationship turns sour most customers who buy stock on credit are asked to sign arbitration agreements and brokerage houses are increasingly extending those agreements to cash accounts to that means that most disputes between investors in their Brokers will now be settled in arbitration and the SEC has some, cern's among those concerns is a sense that it is important that the customers of Brokers be treated fairly and that those customers believe they are being treated fairly to ensure that the SEC voted to recommend changes in the arbitration process the most sweeping at the proposed changes would limit the use of arbitrators with any ties to the Securities industry and hence any potential conflict of interest that, bubbles the National Association of Securities dealers which runs the largest arbitration program over 70% of arbitrators who are public arbitrators have some sort of Industry tie and it will mean that we will have to go on a major recruitment effort that at a time when the number of cases presented for arbitration has been mushrooming that's expected to grow still faster in the weight of the Supreme Court ruling the industry will have three years to adapt to the proposed change other changes could come sooner the, cc is continuing to scrutinize the arbitration process it's of the latest move is only a first step Deborah marchini

jkhb0039,"this is what America is all about really what we're trying to do here is just the apart of, K rebuild this economy I don't want to be the ones who have to carry the whole tax burden some of our economic problems well I'd say I've always been very proud of the people of RJR but I've never been any more friends than I am today to see how 1,400 of you have come together taking your time and your energy to go to Washington let your voices be heard, and first of five the voice of our state's tobacco industry is ringing loud and clear in the nation's capital 1500 people who make their living from tobacco most employees have RJ are boarded buses in Winston-Salem at 5:00 this morning for the six hour drive to Washington the trip was their own doing not the orders of RJR Executives they use vacation time or their own time and paid $26 for the ticket to ride 33, we buses that the Piedmont for the nation's capital the reason for the huge turnout is simple it's my job J OB tobacco workers say they have come to Capitol Hill to Simply complained about the troubles facing North Carolina they've come here to convince lawmakers from other states that higher cigarette taxes these trouble for them as well, what you're about to hear concerning the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs as a direct result of a big cigarette tax hike is all, true, it's very easy for others to just sit back and say the people who grow tobacco and just grow something else and the people who make cigarettes can just make something else, just think about losing your jobs when money and jobs are tight today since July of 1992 this family coverage Benefit Plan has paid out some thirty eight thousand dollars in medical coverage for my daughter alone I've attached a statement to this effect ladies and gentlemen this family health care benefit plan for my daughter by other children my wife and myself and thousands of others is maintained that offered for, use out of the prophets the RJ Reynolds tobacco company makes from the sales of its legal products cigarettes both my husband and I work for rentals and excise tax would be devastating to our family we would possibly lose our good jobs and be thrown out into the job market at a time in our lives when we should be planning for retirement as someone who can trace the effect of a tobacco tax or two generations and three states the domino effect is very clear to see in the, and States 1/3 of the economy is healed based on agriculture and related business suppliers tobacco is the leading legal cash crops tobacco accounts for a total of Thirteen billion dollars a year to federal state and local governments in taxes of course a drop of 44% and consumption nearly half is going to change that in a hurry we all work for General back to bring by 40,000 dish, and we just want him to know that we need all the pool leaking mustard, he will do everything in his power, yes mr. tobacco you're doing what the country expects you to do you're coming to represent your fans there's nothing more important than individual citizens, appearing in the offices of members of Congress and taught you about their concerns directly and folks in this Great Hall behind me their whole lot of smart people like the smartest guy on that hill but I'm smart enough to figure this out farmers are standing up and workers are standing up saying that these are about jobs and we want you to know that this is an economic issue and you must consider the, and as you leave the money and the private sector and you create the jobs they're bringing it to Washington you create the jobs that and we don't need them here we needed at home you're coming here to show your concern about your country for your livelihood while your families and I commend you for that earlier this week we had delivered from signature had delivered signatures on petitions primarily gathered in Tim Valentine in my, district totaling over 22,000 with the 50,000 that you have brought today in the 10,000 more you're going to sin let's get it up to 100,000 okay thank you for the effort that it took personal sacrifice that it took the commitment the come here and show Washington that this this is not just an abstract problem this is not just a matter of economic statistics this is the problem with the human face, I do want to say this to you and I say it from the bottom of my heart, it's great to be on the same team with you I look at In This Crowd and I've seen so many people as our walk down here the meant so much to me through the years you stood with me and by golly I'm going to stand with you I just want to thank you one more time for coming up and spending your time helping us with this fight we all stay in touch with us and we will do all we can to make sure, that there are no more Cactus I like to take this opportunity to thank you in the true American Spirit we're going to Washington and protest and it's unfair tax being proposed against our product I'm also proud of the people at work apart who conceived this idea and help bring it to its conclusion I want to thank everybody that went on the bus trip to Washington your willingness to go up and protest these unfair, taxes is being proposed certainly shows your commitment to our industry and our company our families have been supported by tobacco for many years and we need to stand up for our rights on this issue thank you for taking the time to go and stand up for our industry company and our jobs I want to congratulate all of you that went on that trip to Washington it was an absolutely first-rate job I underst really proud of everything you've done for this company thank you Congressman IAM on behalf, half of the employees of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company armored our friends and tobacco we're here today with approximately 50,000 signatures that has been gathered in less than two months I understand that we have approximately 10,000 more back in Winston-Salem we will be forwarding petitions to you but we're going to keep this application program going we hope you will be able to get this to the president and all subsequent petition still, we want him to know how we feel thank you and we'll do our very best to get these to the present this is just the beginning don't stop now hello you just see how your team members in Winston-Salem decide to respond to the proposed increases in the federal excise tax on cigarettes we're very proud of their efforts but to win this battle we need your help to in fact your field sales team could accomplish something that we can't do from the home office, in North Carolina is tobacco growing and tobacco manufacturing country the Congressional delegates from North Carolina will give us a lot of support in the capital during the debate on excise taxes but one States voice will not be enough to win this issue this isn't just a concern for North Carolina it's a national issue and we need to get people to understand that that's where you come in you can help protect our business and thousands of other jobs by getting the facts out and writing other people across the country we've already, you some information on the impact of excise tax increases and we're prepared to make more available to you share this information The Smokers V Taylor's friends with tobacco and Civic leaders in your community and increase in the excise tax with me that many adults who choose to smoke but no longer afford the product those law cells would translate to jobs to disappear there are two point three million jobs in America that depend directly or indirectly on the tobacco business to see, includes farmers and Factory workers and manufacturers and retailers of many different products if the federal excise tax on cigarettes were increased by one dollar a pack as many as three hundred eighty eight thousand jobs would disappear Across the Nation and as much as 11 billion dollars in pay checks throughout our country's economy would also evaporate the retail trade alone would lose as many as 28,000 jobs, there's a lot of talk in Washington about using higher cigarette excise taxes to fund a National Health Care program but if America's Health Care system is broken the government should fix it not just throw more money at the problem according to Consumer Reports at least 200 billion Healthcare dollars were wasted on overpriced useless treatments and a bloated bureaucracy in 1992 furthermore smokers already pay their fair share of taxes more than 11, in dollars a year in federal state and local taxes at the price of cigarettes gets so high that sells declined dramatically those local state and federal treasuries will see a drop in the revenues not an increase we must tell the whole story about excise taxes or could put many hardworking Americans out of a job a lot of fine people out of business just consider the impact on convenience stores one of the cornerstones of retailing in this, tree many of them get about 20 percent of their profits from cigarette sales what will happen to their businesses if that profit turns down sharply, we don't want to sit back and watch thousands of families and businesses suffer including our own you can help first call and write the United States House and Senate members who represent you and tell them you oppose any increase in excise taxes on Tobacco if you need the names or phone numbers of your representatives call this our day our business watch number and they'll give you that information, during Memorial Day July 4th and the August recess has your Congress will be in their home districts which gives you and your allies are opportunity to call them in person in addition right to President Clinton and let him know you believe that any additional cigarette taxes unfair here's the White House address,encourage smokers friends and neighbors to ride as well ask your suppliers and customers to contact their elected officials your daily routines put you in touch with lots of people if you would like to volunteer some time to calling other people as well we can provide you with a list of smokers in your area and the outline for message you can deliver to them by phone we can provide you with petitions so that you can collect signatures of people, all opposed to an excise tax increase you could also ask your retailers if they would be willing to collect signatures from the smokers in their stores our employees trip to Washington was their idea it came about because they were concerned about the issue and they Enlisted the support of other RJ our employees and their friends and contacts I encourage you to do the same thing reach out to bring allies on board with us, we can provide you with information about excise taxes and jobs that specific to your state if you need any kind of information advice or assistance call our business watch line and we'll get you the help that you need, no one knows what the outcome of this battle will be but from the years I spent working in Senate offices and in the White House I can tell you a couple things with certainty first the individual voices of Voters and Business Leaders speaking out from their home States will make a much more powerful statement than anything our company might say or do through corporate channels, second our opponents are very committed to this battle so we must display equal commitment and energy if we intend to win, it's important to understand that the debate over cigarette tax proposals is likely to be a long complex and heated battle if we want to successfully oppose these measures we must be committed to sustaining our activity perhaps throughout the year ahead this is a marathon not a hundred yard dash you need to tell the story again and again about excise taxes I know that your hands were full on the job especially as we address, is the new actions taken by our competitors effectively responding to that situation will be critical to our business the excise tax issue is critical to our business to devoting some of your personal time to fighting the tax battle could spell the difference in our future personally and as an industry, RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company depends on your dedication and your ideas about how to run this business and we need the same thing from you on the tax issue you can make your own voice heard and possibly bring hundreds of other voices to the table we can't fight all the wars in our industry we have to pick our battles carefully this is one that really matters and you're one of the most important resources we have you are RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company, company in your towns you are Business Leaders in your community and you are the voters and hardworking families who live and work in every state in this nation so please join us in speaking up for our rights thank you for taking the time to let me talk with you today",0.8496593871794872,0.70031285,0.9128388
jkxb0079,"the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce proudly presents its J's program the J's program is based on a simple premise kids shouldn't smoke, state laws that prohibit sales of cigarettes to minors can be effective in fact recent Studies have been conducted where tobacco age restriction laws were observed by retailers the results show that minors access to cigarettes with reduced by over 50% this translates to a significant reduction in underage smoking however minimum age laws for tobacco or any other products won't make a difference unless they are supported by retailers and the, immunity that's where the Jays program comes in at a time when the US Surgeon General has identified stopping youth smoking as a top priority and is encouraging community-based efforts to address this issue the u.s. junior chamber has arrived with a program that can be an important part of the youth smoking solution no organization is better equipped to tackle this challenge hi I'm Gary Tompkins president of the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce every JC, share the strong commitment to community service and that's what the JC's against you smoking program is all about we can all agree that kids shouldn't smoke our organization is playing a national leadership role helping to focus attention on this issue and reduce the amount of underage smoking the Jays program is simple straightforward and perfectly suited to the junior chamber not only does it provide opportunities for us to get out and to work to better our communities it also allows us to build and strengthen valuable relationships with Lon, enforcement organizations public officials business and Community leaders and the media in addition the program provides tremendous public awareness and Public Relation opportunities that will Aid in chapter recognition and recruitment no organization is better suited to tackle this issue than we are but it's going to take participation from as many of our chapters as possible to make the kind of impact that's needed I urge every JC to get involved in this effort and make it a program that we can all be proud of, thank you and what the Jaycees think about the Jays program to give like an old JC something that looks fresh enough and knew enough to spark new interest will be catching wonderful I saw some tremendous opportunities for ongoing JC public awareness public relations there are at least three or four media opportunities that you can get in there through the Jays program JC's are Fanning out across the country to conduct Outreach to retail, all stores in their communities during their visits JC's will ask retailers to maintain a store policy of checking IDs or tobacco and all age restricted products they will post signs to promote awareness of minimum age laws and help deter attempts by minors to purchase age restricted products employers will be charged with ensuring that all store employees understand the importance of these laws most importantly each retailer will be a, to sign a JC's responsible Merchants pledge affirming their commitment to help reduce youth access to cigarettes and other age restricted products the Jays program isn't limited to retailer visits participating JC chapters are also working to reach their communities with the support the law message activities include Outreach to local law enforcement and Community officials to inform them of and enlist their support for the Jays program JC's are, partnership with local radio and television stations to place public service announcements featuring actor Danny Glover he discourages youth smoking and encourages parents retailers and the public to support the law not only do the PSAs offer valuable Community benefits but they also let everyone know the local JC's far behind this effort let's do our part in the communities support the law it works a message from the Brownsville, a cease and the WXYZ Channel 8 but blue really pumped in energized by the u.s. JC's involvement this year we feel that the u.s. JC's have played a major role in the development and growth of young people and we hope to play a part of that and to enhance your efforts and Danny Glover isn't the only one excited about the Jays program since J's was launched at the national Toya conference has been an outstanding level of enthusiasm from JC's, wide, and I think it's an excellent opportunity for the organization the JC's to get out into the community to touch and feel the people and have an effect on the youth this is something that we can go out and really make an impact in our communities by talking to people and promoting a program without asking for a donation asking for money trying to sell something, and with that kind of support the monetary support the spokesperson with the Jaycees getting out there and spreading the word I think that they're really going to make an impact the Jaycees are making an impact with this new national service program and what's exciting is they've only just begun hi I'm Steve Lawson Executive Vice President of the u.s. junior Chamber of Commerce and this is Sylvia Saunders National program coordinator for the Jays program we hope this presentation has given you a better understanding of what this important program is all about and why, JC should get involved as you've seen the program is easy to implement and will provide numerous benefits for our communities and the junior chamber we've developed a comprehensive program manual and support materials that should provide everything you need to initiate your own Jazz program it's sort of a just add JC's formula however what really makes this effort special are the inventive ways that various States and chapters are customizing and implementing the program special events are being held Statewide implementation, mentation days are being planned and some states have even arrange for their governor to declare an official Jays day to call attention to the program the opportunities are Limitless and we want you to know that everyone at the national service center is here to help in addition to providing retailer list program materials and supplies we can share ideas for Effective program implementation and help your state or chapter develop or improve its own Jay's plan the Jays enthusiasm is catching and we look forward to getting every chapter on board, weird",0.8002162650000001,0.4599937,0.91230273
jmhb0039,"I would like to thank all of you for taking the time to be here this morning and at the same time I like to apologize to you for the relatively short notice we've given you to get you in here however is you're going to be here in just a few minutes what we're going to be talking to you about this morning is one of the most confidential projects that RJ Reynolds tobacco company has ever been involved in and so we had to handle things in this fashion now at the conclusion of the presentation the formal presentation this morning will be passing out to all, love you copies of a news release is going to cover all the main points you're going to hear about here today so we'll take just a few minutes to do that before we get into the questions and answers now I'd like to introduce mr. Edward a Horrigan it was chairman of the board Chief Executive Officer of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company it's thank you Dave and good morning ladies and gentlemen I would like to add my thanks to Dave today's for all of you coming here and, sharing this time with us as Dave mentioned the purpose of this press conference is to provide you with a progress report on a new product that has been in development of Reynolds tobacco for the past several years now as you will soon hear this product represents a major evolution in cigarette design made possible by technological breakthroughs and rather than have you hear bits of, information rumors and even misinformation during this product development and particularly so in light of recent media speculation we decided to hold this meeting and give you the opportunity to get the facts first hand and then also allowed time for you to ask questions so when I'm finished dick campy president of Reynolds tobacco development company and I will be pleased to try, to answer your questions to the extent that we are able to do so now please bear in mind that this product is still under development and obviously there are some questions that we will just not be able to answer following this briefing, before I tell you about this new cigarette I would like to give you some background to help put this new product in perspective as I mentioned we believe this product represents a major evolutionary step in responding to the perceptions and desires of today's smokers now as many of you know responding to smokers desires is nothing new to, Reynolds tobacco throughout the years are fine company as responded to Smoker's wants by offering product Innovations going back to filter cigarettes and then of course low tar cigarettes and ultra low tar cigarettes or history of product Innovation began in 1913 when we introduced camel and it became the first nationally successful cigarette we continued in that pioneering and innovation, with the development of filter cigarettes and Winston was launched in 1954 we followed up that successful Innovation with Salem which became the first filter tip menthol cigarette in 1956 and more recently our company as I mentioned has become a leader in the development of low and ultra low tar Brands represented with such products as Vantage and now, now those past product advances were achieved through many modifications in tobacco blending filtration and flavoring we do believe however that further major advances of this nature are limited, became obvious then that we had to develop a new cigarette that went beyond tar reduction to address the perceptions regarding cigarettes now as you well know smokers have been facing many challenges and pressures over the past several years ranging from the smoking and health controversy to the social acceptability of smoking, therefore the response to those pressures we began to develop a cigarette that would help smokers address many of the issues they face as they continue to exercise their choice and their right to smoke our efforts have resulted in a new cigarette that heats but does not burn tobacco, now since the tobacco does not burn a majority of the compounds produced by burning tobacco or eliminated or greatly reduced including most compounds that are often associated with the smoking and health controversy simply put we think this will be the world's cleanest cigarette, since the cigarette produces virtually no sidestream smoke after the first few Puffs and no Ash and no tobacco smoke odor we also believe that will be well received by those people who object to tobacco smoke, and since the cigarette eliminates or greatly reduces most of the compounds often associated with the smoking and health controversy we feel this product addresses the desires and the perceptions of many of today's smokers now as you will see on our television monitors this new cigarette looks and lights like other cigarettes it smokes like other, cigarettes it contains carbon monoxide and nicotine like other cigarettes and importantly it provides smokers with tobacco taste and satisfaction like other cigarettes but because it does not burn tobacco it produces no Ash and after the first few Puffs it produces virtually no sidestream smoke that of course is the smoke that comes off the lid and, of the cigarette and in addition the Smoke exhaled by the smoker dissipates rapidly into the air, importantly too is that when it is lit and lying flat the cigarette is also unlikely to ignite most materials we think that's a positive step in addressing the fire safety issue regarding the careless use of cigarettes, now did Kathy present of our development company and I would now like to walk you through a diagram of our product to explain how it works please bear in mind that this diagram ladies and gentlemen is representational the product obviously is still under development and the details the specific details of its construction our proprietary you like the cigarette just as you would any other cigarette, now once it's lit a highly refined carbon heat Source in the tip of the cigarette generates warm air that passes through it Tobacco jacket and through a flavor capsule that contains tobacco extract flavorings and glycerin to form smoke the smoke is then cooled as it passes through a tobacco filter and then through a regular cigarette filter, this cigarette remains lit for about as long as an 85 mm cigarette and it extinguishes itself without having to be crushed out like other cigarettes, because the cigarette does not burn down or part of me does not burn tobacco and therefore does not burn down the smoker disposes of the entire cigarette once it's been smoked we have not yet determined whether or when we will introduce this product nationally or what impact it will have on our company or the marketplace we still have some work to do in the development and testing of this new, cigarette, but Reynolds tobacco has committed and will continue to commit substantial personnel and financial resources to this project, we believe this new cigarette when development is complete will prove to be a major alternative that expands the options currently available to smokers, once again like to thank all of you for taking the time to join us at this meeting and we do hope that you share our enthusiasm and excitement for the potential of this product concept and I'll turn the program now over today official, well the releases are being passed out let me also tell you that once we're through with a question and answer session will have complete press kits for you available in the back of the room that go into a good bit of background on the company mr. Horrigan did campy a lot of the work testing that's been done on this product, and that would be happy to answer as many questions as we can but please keep in mind we've got to keep things within the proprietary limited mr. Horrigan noted in the beginning because this is again a product under development so we'd like to ask one thing as far as ground rules if you would please give us your name and your affiliation your station are the publication your with when you ask Alicia first question and, this gentleman here in the front row is red sighs sorry mr. Horgan on Steve Young from CNN since we did a story Thursday evening there have been a Cascade of stories I heard one murmur in the back as you were winding up someone saying why are we here it's extraordinary at this point in development of a product to have a news conference could you amplify further on why we're here yes I said, outset of my remarks Steve that this project has been in development for several years which it has Reynolds tobacco and obviously under the strictest security possible for a new product concept not unlike anything else we do with other cigarettes but because of the technology involved and over time the loop in terms of information more people becoming involved in the maturation of this concept we felt we had a responsibility to issue a progress report and that is, the reason for this press conference this morning whether any SEC considerations the market moved a lot on Friday the rumors have been churning are there any particular SEC responsibilities on the company we obviously must abide by all the SEC rules and regulations and for that reason as I mentioned the more that we develop the project and more people became involved we did have a responsibility to issue a progress, cord so that people understood even at this early stage where we are the shall we have the glasses I don't understand that all this reference to whether or when which is in both the press release in your remarks that your product is good in this promising as you say why is there any question whether you would introduce it we're highly confident about the fact that we will introduce it but I'll ask it can't be to expand on your the answer to your question sir, and then certainly as Ed said in his remarks is it microphone not working draw your also thank you fine that was working when I was working as that it said in his remarks this is a proprietary development it is undergoing extensive work at Reynolds tobacco and we felt that it was important that we did bring you this progress report we do have intentions of introducing, product sometime in 1988 on a limited Geographic basis we will then determine beyond that exactly how we expand the product leading up to Nashville introduction if I will understand the not all the sound is working so I'll ask dick when he answers questions to come to these microphones to answer that question that you have thank you the show me the front row Peter moves to New York Post what about the health issues is this going to make cigarette smoking, unless harmful to both smokers hell's and to non-smokers who happen to be near smokers when they light up dead we don't accept obviously the allegations that cigarette smoking is indeed harmful to the extent that you did reference it we think that this is an extraordinary step in the evolution of cigarette Design This is a revolution within that evolutionary process here we have, for the first time a product which does not burn tobacco and therefore eliminates or greatly reduces the compounds of burning tobacco including most that have been alleged if you will within the smoking and health controversy no cigarette to this point has ever gone that far and then when you take into consideration as mr. Horrigan said that there was virtually no sidestream smoke from the cigarette this is indeed a significant development that we bring to you today of a cigarette, if you look at the way the tar is measured tar is basically the byproducts of burning tobacco and as I said earlier this product is not contained because it does not burn tobacco therefore eliminates or if you will reduces those compounds in burning tobacco yes the product does contain nicotine but at levels that are no higher than full of Flavour low tar cigarettes which maintain the balance if you will the majority of the market in the u.s. cigarette industry the gentleman behind, and Steve Young Richardson from NBC but by just the development of this type of cigarette are you not admitting that the people who say that smoking causes cancer other side effects in the people who smoke or the smokers in the vicinity aren't you admitting that that's a fact now we are not as thick as mentioned we are aware of the smoking and health controversy exists we are fully appreciative of it we respect the controversy it has not been scientifically established, to the point about this product we consider it evolutionary in a sense no different than filter cigarettes coming out after standard cigarettes and then ultra low tar and low tar and with our technology we were then able to develop this product that addresses smokers perceptions that had been created by the continuing smoking and health controversy Soma from wrote sunglasses you're checking out from CVS I'm wondering about the market for which you intend to see you think people will be buying this in, instead of your current line of product in addition to or some combination of both the we mentioned that we consider that we've offered now if we're successful another alternative to smokers and we hope we will appeal to the adult smoking community and offer them again another option yes are the van with the Nexus TV off part happens from CBS I don't believe you mentioned coughs what the potential cost might be it also would be, since they're not really tobacco products is cigarettes are be subjected to the same taxes to answer your question in Reverse if you don't mind it is a tobacco product you'll note on the diagram the tobacco is contained in at least three portions of the cigarette it contains about 70 percent of u.s. growing domestic and flue-cured tobacco that would be present in other cigarettes it will be produced and marketed as a cigarette we will pay excise taxes, and adhere to all the marketing regulations that apply to cigarettes cost of the cigarettes to the consumer we have a long history happily of profitability and the tobacco business and we will test several pricing levels for it it will be at a premium to other cigarettes but we are comfortable that our pricing decisions will generate the margins that we should have as well as still proved to be good value to the consumer gentleman here in the third row on the right, side one of the powerful German press agency will this product being marketed overseas and where and when yes sir thank you very much the first step because of all the work done in our us technology R&D Labs will be in the United States Market but with these save issues and pressures exist worldwide and if we're successful we indeed see opportunities very broadly in international markets it will be a worldwide brand if we're successful, I'm sorry gentlemen the back there except to put the allegations about smoking and health but would you go as far as to say that this in fact is going to be a safe cigarette we are not saying that this is a safe or safer cigarette because to your point we don't agree with the allegations against the industry what we do say is that this offers smokers another option it doesn't burn tobacco it does not produce sidestream smoke which is becoming, in a social annoyance and we think it has many attractive features that smokers will then have a decision to make again Steve Young are you walking a kind of regulatory tightrope if you call it safer you invite in or safe you invited me FTC presumably with flavor and fragrance technology you could have created the identical or similar taste but by retaining tobacco use circumvent FDA regulation, what is the reason that it contains the back of because we are in the tobacco business we're proud of our heritage we're confident the future and we believe that 50 million Americans who enjoy the customer smoking will accept this flavor when's brought to Market this gentleman I can just add something to that tobacco is mr. Horgan pointed out is in three different parts of the product it's in the tobacco blend it's in the flavor capsule and it's in the tobacco filter and tobacco is absolutely essential to the overall delivery and since, ation and taste if you will of the product this chairman from Ralph Richard ABC ABC radio it sounds as if you're addressing the social concerns and not the medical concerns raised about the connection between cigarettes and cancer no I if I did that I apologize because we said that because this product it does not burn tobacco if therefore eliminates or greatly reduces those compounds that are created with the burning of tobacco, which certain people allege allegedly caused the diseases that we are as an industry accused of if I could follow up it doesn't appear as if you are giving us any statistics or any information about how much reduction there is of those materials that could cause health problems it eliminates virtually 90% of the compounds that are formed by burning tobacco, that correctly the lady sorry is dollars & sense magazine do you have a patent on this we have a series of patents as we continue to develop this product we have registered in filed our patents that's correct so in the front row again as mr. Horrigan stated we're still in the developmental mode and I think, it would be premature to discuss any elements of the marketing mix whether it be named packaging such a in terms of developing and we consider that to be proprietary and it's something I'm sure that even our competition would like to know in this point we'd like to refrain from giving that information out a gem in the back there by the speaker makes a lovely NBC radio news will this product has to have the warning label on the package the health warning label this is a cigarette and I said earlier we will abide by all the rules and regulations regarding, in the marketing and cigarettes it will contain the warning notice the lady red getting white help me Los Angeles Times he tell us how much money you have spent to date on this and how much you expect to spend and also in terms of the number of people committed to this project we consider the investment to date the numbers proprietary I mentioned in my remarks that if we can see you on a successful path we are prepared to commit the financial and personal resources, horses to bring this product to Market domestically and internationally the gentleman the fact their Ted Coleman at Reuters even if you can't see the smoke will it be will you be able to smell the smoke in the same way you can smell smoke from a normal cigarette, well there's virtually no sidestream smoke whatsoever that comes off the lid and there still is of course smoke as the consumer goes through the Innovation process but that smoke also dissipates very very quickly and this product and to answer your question this product will eliminate a few will tobacco odor as most people refer to it in the enjoyment of a cigarette but how will you get the same pleasure that you get now when you inhale the smoke into your lungs it's a it's a very easily as the combination of the, warm air is passing through which is creating the smoke is picking up the flavors the tobacco flavors is warming it not burning it which indeed delivers the flavor and the overall experience that one gets as smoking other cigarettes will be comparable to what kind of cigarette now on the market this is comparable to what we call full of Flavour low tar cigarettes which represent if you will the majority of the market not unlike our own Winston lights brand it's in that category which, which represents the majority of cigarettes sold yes sir production facility after these or do you see using any of your existing plans to make these or we have to build something else we have progressed with this projects of when will we have a production facility in Place Winston Salem with great pride Sr if I imagine you what sort of a response, because this product evolved from the federal government and you have an idea what kind of a statutory warning this cigarette might have to carry I think I mentioned earlier that we will respect all of the laws and requirements regarding the marketing marketing and packaging of cigarettes and it will carry those same warning notices nothing more nothing less we hope that government officials as they hear about this product will be objective and respond to the information that is available, well let's see I think someone at back to standing up if you don't mind the press release that it is too soon to see whether the new product will be introduced I understand you saying you expect to introduce it in 1988 but why might you not introduce this product, I think I think it's a bit unusual that we're getting a progress report because of the because of the complexity of the project we felt obliged to do so but to answer your question this product in terms of planning is going down the same path that any new brand that we would introduced travels and at any point down the road you can continue to make determinations of consumer acceptance and success ratios and those are the factors that come into consideration before you make the decision to Launch, anything beyond that I would have to say is proprietary follow-up are you saying that there's a possibility this product could be a flop we're highly confident that we will continue on a successful path and I'm sorry I think that's all I can say here this morning Michael dish maybe see you again there have been allegations, borne out by a lot of studies that in fact the flavor enhancement in low tar cigarettes is as dangerous if not more dangerous than the tobacco now are you confident that the material on the flavor capsules is in fact going to be safe, we have an extensive testing program which involves chemical analysis toxicological analysis animal inhalation studies we are putting this test this product through an extensive battery of tests not only within Reynolds but also with outside Laboratories that are totally independent in addition we have brought in outside scientists are not associated whatsoever with Reynolds to review all of our, testing protocols and the results and at the time that we are ready to go to market we will be more than happy both the share that information with the Press with science and also for peer-reviewed journals we have said in answer to a simple question earlier we're not saying it's a safe or safer cigarette we're saying that many of the allegations against the product that is now in the marketplace are other cigarettes the burning of tobacco the formation of compounds, of the because they are greatly reduced or eliminated this product we think that that answers those perceptions that's that's all we'll say I'm sorry the dome in the back of the brown jacket yes and from our soldiers has this product and tested on any smokers and can you say what the response is benefit has been tested yes after we had characterized the chemical composition and all the components and it put us through all of our standards with respect to, a product before it can go through testings with with consumers we have tested it we find the results to be very encouraging in terms of the overall delivery taste and and satisfaction that the consumer enjoys and at this point we're very happy with the progress that we have made so the consumers have tried and then they would switch to the product or I think that it's you know premature at this point for, us to forecast what level of consumers will ultimately respond to this product we are extremely encouraged by the way that the product has been developed up to this point and as mr. Horrigan had pointed out this product does respond to a number of the issues and pressures and allegations that confront the cigarette industry in combination with those two factors were hopeful but it would be premature to speculate on what success this product the lady sitting in front of Steve Young, many Smokers smoke simply for the nicotine gratification and you stay here that it will produce nicotine the same level so you are saying that it will produce a nicotine gratification and to will you be making it in a menthol, this is a cigarette it contains tobacco and as such a contains nicotine and ultimately if indeed the product reaches our expectations which we are hopeful that it will it is quite likely that they a mental alternative will be made available the shown with the New York Post now take Steve Young after that and we're going to begin to cut down the questions you don't mind what do you anticipate the market share for cigarettes such as this to be, we have not really made a determination on what the share will be on this product we think there's a market for it by expanding the range of product options to a the smoking public and frankly test markets are what determine what share of Marcus can be achieved and then ultimately marketing Investments Steve Young multi-part question does the heat Source burn hotter than tobacco and present products, who do you believe is closest to you and trying to develop this technology and lastly could you identify your advertising agency on this father taking it from Back to Front we can consider the last question proprietary Steve the second question is that we don't we don't know what are we don't keep track of comp we keep track of competition I'm sorry but whatever is working within their Labs we are not let's say knowledgeable of it we think we've got, got something here that is on the Leading Edge but we don't know for sure with regard to the heating propensity I'll ask to Kemp yes a question this is a highly refined carbon fuel source and regrettably I would consider that again to be proprietary information in terms of the characteristics at the point in time when it is ready to go to market I'd be more than happy to share that information with you but competitively would not be appropriate to do it at this point we'll take one more question and I think from this portion of that not been heard from all morning the lady behind, the other day of of the Atlanta Constitution can you tell us if the tobacco and tobacco jacket is any different than tobacco in a standard cigarettes and also because the cigarette uses only seventy percent of the amount of tobacco substandard cigarette are you concerned about an outcry from the tobacco producers first of all with regard to an outcry from The Producers we hope that if we're successful that this will help, long term in terms of the success of the tobacco industry and therefore add another dimension secondly while it is contains less tobacco we have made the decision that the flue-cured and Burley tobacco in this product will be totally domestically grown tobacco's there will be some Turkish in there for flavoring which is not grown in the United States but otherwise it will all be domestic and we hope the Growers will support us and be cheered by that news that completes our press conference, we thank you all again for coming thank you very much cigarette",0.8522121773611111,0.70575136,0.9128387
jmmc0083,"we do almost 200 million dollars a year in cigarette sales are convenience product mix in our stores when you look at overall Clark all 800 plus stores he's almost 60 percent cigarettes it also contributes to our bottom-line gross margin profitability it may be the only other true destination item, across convenience store Supermarket Mass merchandisers and tobacco store outlets cigarettes were a 49 billion dollar business last year for these retailers cigarettes are important not only for the value of the prophets they deliver but for the consumers they attract hi I'm Greg radzinsky welcome to a convenience store in sites video category review in this program we'll look at the tobacco category across all classes of trade, in follow-up with a channel specific look at the opportunities that exist there today we'll examine how properly managing this category can help attract satisfy in earned the Loyalty of valuable customers and finally we'll look at specific steps of action retailers can take to secure a bigger share of this lucrative business, first to better understand the opportunities for any given Channel let's take a big picture view of the trends impacting the tobacco business across all Outlets today retail tobacco sales are up more than 20 percent over 1995 this aggregate number however conceals dramatic and fundamental changes occurring across the trade classes let's take a closer look convenience stores are enjoying real growth haven't driven their share up 11, percentage points since the early 1990s a portion of this growth is attributable to an increase in Outlets which has risen nearly five percent over the same time ceased or gains came largely at the expense of the supermarket Channel who share his drop by eight points this drop in share was accompanied by a 12% decrease in the number of stores, Mass merchandisers are holding steady with only a one point loss of share over the past six years this is significant especially in the face of a 20% decrease in store cap tobacco stores have clearly cracked the code for Effective cigarette sales increasing their share from 1 to 7 percent store count has also mushroom two more than 3,400 Outlets a five hundred and forty five percent increase, other classes of trade including Liquor Club gas hotels restaurants and newsstand Outlets have dropped four percentage points and share as well as nearly a third of their Outlets, another key Trend here is the decrease in the number of retail outlets selling cigarettes despite this consolidation however category sales continue to grow, for instance look at the runaway success of a relatively new class of trade the tobacco store, these small and smoker friendly stores are attracting adult smokers and their dollars from other classes of trade the key to competing with these Outlets is to understand the reasons for their success if you really enjoy smoking to go into a place that wants to have you watch to serve you give you a wide variety of tobacco products I think it's a refreshing change relative to a lot of places tobacco stores succeed in creating a smoker friendly environment where adult smokers can easily locate their favorite brand, they offer very competitive pricing and their diligent and aggressive about their promotional executions fortunately these are all tactics that will work for virtually any class of Trade One Trend that transcends class of trade distinction including tobacco stores is the growth of Premium Brands consumers will always want the quality and certainly a Marlboro has a lot higher quality than a basic or a GPC approved there's no doubt about that so there's a quality aspect there there's also an image aspect this is good news, news for all cigarette retailers because premium Brands deliver premium profit margins understanding the price value equation from the consumers point of view can be a challenge in any category but it's particularly true for cigarettes cigarettes I would say more than any other product have their purchase patterns at both ends of the spectrum somebody might buy five or ten cartons of cigarettes at one time save money at the other end they might buy their package every day well they don't want to have to run off to, two minutes for the price Club to do that they want to go right on the corner and the convenience store is likely the one that's going to be there another Trend occurring across the board is consumer response to out of stocks today's time press consumers show little patience for stores that don't consistently stock their brand the fact is particularly significant two convenience stores a frequent destination for cigarette Shoppers allowing these customers to leave empty-handed not only for fits the profits on the tobacco purchase it loses additional dollars that could have been spent on the, same occasion even worse the customer could decide to take their business Elsewhere for good, having seen the big picture Trends impacting the industry let's take a closer look at the cigarette category as it relates to the c-store channel, in see stores cigarettes lead the store accounting for more than a quarter of every Prophet dollar cigarettes are followed in a distant second buy beer at 12% in food service at 11% cigarettes are just as valuable for the Shoppers they attract average Shopper spent $36 per three month period where is the cigarette Shopper spends a hundred and thirty four dollars in the same period, buyers of Premium brands or even more valuable spending a hundred and forty-five dollars in the same three month period the savviest retailers recognize that adult smokers are loyal to their brands in fact 62 percent of adult smokers would rather switch stores than switch Brands the key then is to use that brand loyalty to build store loyalty which is exactly what one Midwestern see store operator Clark refining and marketing has been doing for some time, we do almost 200 million dollars a year in cigarette sales so it is a significant part of our business it also contributes to our bottom-line gross margin profitability any time you have two hundred million dollars of sales of anything you're going to make some money off of just from a transactions standpoint alone that's over 75 million transactions a year and we have that involve cigarettes other than gasoline to a certain degree it may be the only other true destination item it is also a, can't part of our product mix from a community product standpoint our convenience product mix in our stores when you look at overall Clark all 800 plus stores is almost 60% cigarettes recognizing the importance of the category Clark has developed a simple and effective strategy we have a one-page strategy for on cigarettes that's our business I don't know of any other two hundred million dollar business in a company that can have a one-page strategy our cigarette strategy comes in two forms one would be, Eternal or call it industry-specific that has to do with the rack placement dollars that come in for having the racks on our counters when we talk about cigarette cigar stores from a category management perspective it's true category management for my profitability stance there is nothing else that we can put on our calendars that will generate the type of profile of the type of profitability per square inch that a cigarette rack well the other piece of the strategy is truly the product offering the consumer and, there when you come into our stores you're looking to buy a pack maybe 20 cigarettes so you're going to pay a very fair price if you decide to buy up to three we're going to offer you a good deal that is where we look to generate incremental sales and incremental Penny profits and offering a value to the consumer if you would like to buy cartons we're not going to charge you more than our three packs and in some of our stores we actually have carbon pricing in place it comes all the way down to managing it on a bicycle basis giving the store manager of the, also they need and the level of knowledge and understanding of our cigarette philosophy a big part of having the right tools is taking advantage of the information and resources leading manufacturers make available most recently a tool that was provided to us from Philip Morris put this report together on a Buy store basis and it pulls the top 40s ku's in every one of our 800 plus stores and it's one page that's broken down by what that SKU is the brand packing style and, what is the total volume that we've done in that store for those Brandt for those brand packing Styles over 52 weeks what is the average weekly order quantity because you're taking out all seasonality and everything else there and also build two levels so what this provides our store managers are mst's to do is micromanage this business down to the SKU level without having to completely understand that story, we're estimating that our gross margin profitability will go up by about a million dollars in our sales may go up by as much as five million dollars because of this one tool that Philip Morris has provided to us it clearly identifies where we need to focus in the store and the top has ku's it's also something that doesn't necessarily help just Philip Morris it helps manage the entire category, as we've seen here today Clark success in the cigarette category has been a result of a disciplined approach to category management further retailers looking to do the same here's a questions they should be asking themselves am I carrying the right products it's important to have sufficient quantities of leading Brands to protect against out of stocks out of stocks on cigarettes can have a negative effect on total store sale when you take a look at, at what's happening in cigarette consumption across the country it's flat to slightly down what that means is if we lose a cigarette sale it's going to go across the street it's one of those want a cigarette consumer wants to buy cigarette they're going to buy it they don't buy from us are going to buy it from somebody else so an out of stock is a permanent loss sale is my cigarette offering well-positioned make it quick and easy for consumers to find the brands they want stock the most popular brands in the best fixture locations, are my prices competitive with the market coming to any of our stores you will find a very fair price for single packs in that marketing area it's not blanket pricing across the company or by area it's truly managing pricing on an individual store basis keep in mind however that price is only one component in the value equation just ten percent of Shoppers select the c-store based on price while price oriented promotions do influence cigarette buying decisions keep in mind, come to see stores for convenience am I offering sufficient promotion as we've seen tobacco stores do an exceptional job making promotional displays and point-of-sale materials visible to adult smokers this simple but effective tactic should be at the top of the list for every C store operator especially for those Outlets looking to defend themselves against these emerging tobacco stores, consumers like promotions and promotions work consider 66 percent of smokers say complimentary pack offerings are very or somewhat likely to influence purchase decision 50% say the same for free merchandise in fifty percent say the same for money off packs and cartons reward and reinforce key customers with regular promotions supported by high visibility POS displays

Davis has says that this, is so prevalent I can't understand why he has not been able to come up with a picture since 1981 in fact Davis produces other evidence this videotape he says shows a 16 and 17 year old he recruited being given free cigarettes Illinois Law prohibits those under 18 from smoking and the tobacco institute's own guidelines band Distributors from giving samples to those under 21 people have made charges that they have seen, sample is giving away cigarettes two teenagers that is against the law and if they were law-abiding citizens they would take that to the state's attorney for prosecution and we stand by them 100% they're the ones that are employing the people that are passing out the free cigarettes ampuls now if they're not passing them out the way they're supposed to be why aren't they firing these Distributing companies and going to others or why aren't they taking them to court as well ultimately the argument may come down to the city council, the American Medical Association has drafted a sample ordinance for Banning sampling hearings on such a band took place last year and as soon as the council's infighting is resolved Alderman Bernard Stone says he will revive the ban ordinance cigarettes are in fact dangerous to the health of the community I don't think the community should lend itself to to poisoning itself as a simple as that, cigarette sampling Dan's have been passed by Minneapolis st.

jtjh0182,"hello I'm Jack Kelly for Milton Roy company you probably associate the name Milton Roy with fluid metering technology and analytical instrumentation however today we'd like to talk to you about something new name, we a very promising industrial process technology called supercritical fluid extraction in this age of heightened concern over environmental pollution and the inherent difficulty of handling hazardous organic chemicals there is clearly a need to employ cleaner and safer methods for the production of such products as petrochemicals Cosmetics food paper products and more it is these issues combined with the growing cost for organic extraction solvents that has led to the emergence of supercritical fluid extraction not only does SCE employ harm, solvents like CO2 in lieu of hexane or methylene chloride but also dense gas solvents like carbon dioxide are relatively inexpensive and do not require expensive containerization and Disposal techniques as one Observer noted the safest and least expensive industrial solvent is right under our noses exhale it's carbon dioxide, this is a pressure temperature phase diagram for any common substance found in nature as you see from the graph depending upon the conditions of temperature and pressure any material can exist as a solid liquid or gas when matter in a gaseous form is heated above its critical temperature it will not form a liquid or solid regardless of pressure the pressure necessary to, form a liquid at critical temperature is called the critical pressure the point where the critical temperature and the critical pressure intersect on a phase diagram is called the critical point critical point defines the threshold above which any matter in a gaseous state is considered a supercritical fluid, here we see the solubility of a common organic compound called napthalene in carbon dioxide at various pressures in this series of experiments and extraction vessel was loaded with a known amount of naphthalene pressurized to a given number of atmospheres and at constant pressure the temperature was elevated keeping in mind that the critical temperature for carbon dioxide is 31 degrees Centigrade we notice that, at above the critical temperature solubility diminishes rapidly at less than 120 atmospheres however by compressing the gas to up to 300 atmospheres or approximately 4,500 pounds per square inch solubility increases with increasing temperature among the implications of these data are the following, increasing temperature at or near the critical point defined as the line between near critical liquid and supercritical fluid causes a dramatic decrease in solvent density and therefore a rapid loss in solubility the decrease in solubility results from temperature effects on density which overwhelmed the normal increases in solubility associated with Kinetic motion however at, higher pressures this density loss is neutralized and normal solubility increases associated with higher temperatures predominate since solubility is very temperature-dependent extraction processes can be carried out at constant pressure with temperature of the supercritical fluid used to raise or lower solubility beyond the issue of density there are other factors which affect the solubility of, he's in supercritical fluids the relative volatility of the solute as well as solute solvent chemical Affinity impact both the solubility and desorption behavior of solute supercritical fluid solvent systems, now we see the same experiment operated at constant temperature with varying pressure worth noting is that increases in pressure near the critical temperature of carbon dioxide have very little effect upon increases in the solubility of naphthalene this condition improves when we increase the temperature to 45 degrees Centigrade however the greatest effect of increasing pressure on solubility occurs at more than, 20 degrees higher than critical temperature shown here at the 55 degree Centigrade isotherm these data support the theory that slight increases in temperature at or near the critical point Cause precipitous drops in supercritical fluid density and therefore a rapid loss of solubility for this reason most carbon dioxide supercritical fluid extraction 's are carried out at temperatures in excess of, 50 degrees Centigrade, we have plotted the varying diffusivity of CO2 as a function of increasing temperature all of the isobars for CO2 are at higher diffusivity than normal liquids this chart also demonstrates the inverse relationship between solvent density and diffusivity the permeability of the supercritical fluid combined with its solvating power due to high density account for the enhanced, characteristics of gases compressed to a dense state by maintaining high density through pressure and enhanced diffusivity by remaining a gas a supercritical fluid solvent can approximate the mass transfer characteristics of a liquid solvent the notion of using everyday solvents like CO2 ammonia even water vapor as industrial solvents has as you've just seen a sound theoretical basis however the true value of any technology, he depends upon the applications that can address as well as what if any process problems it can solve in other words what can we do is supercritical extraction that works as well as if not better than chemical extraction at a cost close to present methods perhaps the best way to begin a discussion of super critical applications this to distinguish the process from two commonly employed solvent extraction systems namely methylene chloride and ethanol water, here is a gas chromatographic profile of a typical natural product containing essential oils Esters free fatty acids fatty oils waxes resins and pigments the components going from left to right represent a steady increase in molecular weight and therefore a steady decrease in volatility when the natural product is mixed with methylene chloride, ride the Shaded area is extracted into the organic solvent however to recover the natural products some means of vacuum distillation is required during distillation the most volatile components shown in the upper left corner will be lost, by employing a polar solvent containing ethanol and water the pictured extraction takes place compared to the organic solvent the polar solvent system is nowhere near as efficient in addition during removal of the ethanol water solvent by heat distillation even more severe losses of product are experienced, here we see the extraction behavior of supercritical CO2 on the same natural product not only does this solvent emulate methylene chloride in terms of extraction efficiency but note also by varying the pressure of extraction we can be selective in what components are removed from the starting material for example if we extract at 4350 PSI and 60 degree centigrade, we can carry into the vapor phase virtually everything found in the methylene chloride solvent however unlike organic solvent extractions which is an all-or-nothing Technique we can lower the density of the solvent through the use of lower pressures and thereby achieve a more exacting separation of components from this particular mixture a fractionated extraction would begin near the critical point and be carried to very high pressures, until the least soluble compound of interest is dissolved next the saturated vapor is taken through a series of fractionation steps in which density is lowered and the least soluble fraction collected the remaining solvent solute vapor is further separated by another decrease in density by this means a small or large number of solute fractions can be collected depending upon the needs of the processor, this is but a partial list of current applications for industrial supercritical extraction among its more popular uses are in the decaffeination of products such as coffee beans tea leaves and cocoa beans in addition vegetable fats and oils can be isolated and purified from soybeans wheat and corn supercritical fluid extraction has been found to be useful also in the production of flavors and fragrances, not shown in this table are other applications such as residual oil extraction employing supercritical propane and the production of hops extract for beer manufacturing plus the isolation and purification of many important products from bioengineered microorganisms, this chart summarizes the advantages of supercritical fluid extraction over customary industrial chemical extraction techniques by virtue of the volatility of the supercritical fluid post extraction distillation is not required as a result extraction and separation of compounds can be accomplished at low temperatures there are by avoiding the degradation of thermally labile compounds since the, critical fluid is highly volatile at room temperature there is virtually no residual solvent left in the product following extraction separation and depressurisation supercritical extraction involves very little heat thus avoiding the high thermal energy requirement of distillation since most supercritical fluids are non toxic compounds they represent a highly attractive alternative to hazardous organic industrial solvents, we saw earlier that the selective nature of supercritical extraction enables the separation and purification of compounds in a mixture by means of post extraction fractionation finally besides possessing the favorable characteristics of solvating power and diffusivity the low viscosity of supercritical fluids enables very rapid extractions when solubility conditions are optimal, so far in our discussion of supercritical extraction which is also known as dense gas extraction we've looked at it from a cigarette achill and practical viewpoint but what makes the technology work on not the solubility curves nor the processing need it is the physical Hardware that puts it all into action so let's look at the basic hardware needed to operate a high-pressure solvent extraction system employing supercritical fluids, in its most basic form a dense gas extraction Hardware schematic contains only four components first the extraction vessel where the mixture to be separated is placed and the supercritical fluid initiates extraction second a pressure relief system wherein the pressure of the system is reduced allowing the vapor solute mixture to vent to a, third component called the separator in this low pressure separator vessel The Vapor solute mixture separates and the solute fraction is collected finally we have a packed plunger metering pump where the supercritical fluid is metered and recycled to the extractor, here is the same basic schematic superimposed on a counter current recirculating system wherein a fermentation product is continually extracted with carbon dioxide in a counter current path through the extractor the entrained solute passes through a pressure relief expander into the separator and the extracted product is collected meanwhile the carbon dioxide is recycled and returned to the extractor through the pump, this extraction schematic contemplates the use of to extractors operating in parallel where in one fills with product and is pressurized while the second extractor empties to the separator a single separator vessel is required for the collection of extracted product carbon dioxide or other supercritical solvent is metered and repressurized Via The Pact plunger metering pump, here we have a standard supercritical fluid pilot scale extraction system reading from left to right a source of liquid CO2 is cooled and allowed to pass into the inlet of a packed plunger metering pump capable of supercritical fluid delivery of up to fifty four hundred PSI by means of a back pressure valve and cooling of the head of the pump we can maintain the supercritical fluid in a liquid state during the pumps, goal operating in parallel with the supercritical fluid delivery system is a second packed plunger pop capable of delivering the product to be extracted at pressures up to 500 PSI this product is held in a 10-gallon agitated slurry tank both product and supercritical fluid are introduced to a four liter stainless steel extraction vessel capable of operating at pressures of 5,000 PSI, in this particular design the extractor contains a magnetically driven agitator to enhance the interaction of product with supercritical solvent, in order to properly control temperature a heating block is employed which operates from a temperature indicator and controller after the extractor the operator has two options with the back pressure valve opened and the air operated valve closed the user can carry out batch extraction opening and closing the air operated valve to vent the solute Vapor mixture, alternatively the air operated valve can remain open and the back pressure valve adjusted to maintain a constant differential pressure across the extractor separator bridge in this latter mode the CO2 would be recirculated and return to the cooling bath for repressurization the separator vessel which is also encapsulated in a controlled heating block has a 2 liter capacity and 5,000 PSI pressure capability, a pressure and temperature indications can be recorded on digital display or maintained as hard copy on a strip chart recorder this engineering drawing depicts a full-scale supercritical fluid production plant capable of operating at pressures up to 7,500 PSI this design is also optimized for either liquid or solid product extraction schemes reading again from left to right the liquid product would be delivered via, packed plunger pump to a 500-gallon high-pressure extractor solid products would be introduced via a loss in weight Drive feeder feeding a solid fill surge chamber by maintaining a differential pressure between the solid fuel chamber and the high pressure extractor and the opening of a large diameter ball valve the solid products would be introduced into the extractor the solid product would be removed from the, chamber by reversing the delivery process supercritical fluid Vapor containing the entrain solute would be vented to a bank of separators operating at varying pressures or temperatures by this means an exacting fractionation of components in the supercritical solvent would be accomplished the extracted product would be removed via the surge Chambers or liquid removal pumps depending upon the application, each separator would have a 125 gallon capacity capable of operating to 7500 pounds per square inch for those applications which require a reverse extraction we're in the contents of any one of the separators is reintroduced to the extractor this extraction Loop is provided also you will note that in both the primary extraction and reverse extraction Loops the presence of a monitor, it will be discussed shortly this is one of several of Milton rice production plants this particular facility is located in Suburban Philadelphia with in this operation Milton Roy company designs and manufactures pilot and production scale supercritical extraction systems in addition to manufacturing completely integrated extraction units Milton Roy through its analytical instrumentation group can provide monitoring instrumentation and recording devices in order to optimize extraction conditions as well as report the results of the process during, an actual operation once more Milton Roy continues to investigate new and better ways to handle material during the chemical and physical interaction of supercritical solvents and extractable products since supercritical fluids are by their nature simple molecules whereas the solutes they in train can be fairly complex organic species there is an ideal opportunity to, to employ opto electronic detection devices to measure the solute load in the dense gas solvent since the gas will tend not to react with the detection system whereas the solute will a detection method based upon ultraviolet light absorption has been shown to be sufficient in the majority of cases involving the extraction of complex organic solutes like caffeine, superimposed in the slide on the basic extraction Hardware are three areas where detection information is valuable at Point 1 we can measure the amount of entrained solute thereby determining the efficiency of the extraction at Point 2 we can quantitatively analyze the extracted material during in line quality control at Point 3 we measure the residual solute left in the extracted product, Milton Roy company has recently introduced the critical extraction monitor UV light absorbance detector for use in solute load detection during supercritical fluid extraction this instrument operates at pressures up to 5,000 PSI and over a temperature range of 25 to 60 degrees Centigrade the critical extraction monitor is based upon Milton Roy's popular Spectrum monitor detector series which has become the benchmark, each Mark of detectors in the field of high-performance liquid chromatography the monitor is capable of measuring and trained UV absorbing solutes during active extraction thereby giving the processor a quantitative analysis of the extraction efficiency under the given temperature and pressure conditions Milton Roy plans to introduce in the near future a modified detector capable of operating at pressures up to 10,000 pounds, square inch, in a liquid Vapor extraction scheme the active surface area for absorption of the solute by the supercritical solvent is limited to the liquid Vapor interface while agitation of the liquid in the extraction can enhance the surface area of extraction there are alternative schemes by employing porous membranes the processor can affect a mass transfer from product to supercritical solvent, however this technique is limited to non organic liquids at close to a ph of 7 which contain very few particles compounds of molecular weights in excess of 100,000 have been shown to for macro molecular layers on the membrane thereby inhibiting Mass transfer, as an alternative to membrane technology the use of silica to which is bonded alkane chains of various lengths has been shown to affect very exacting separations of nearly identical molecular structures this technology not only exploits The Selective solubility of the supercritical solvent for the components in a chemical mixture but also takes advantage of any selective retention of the solutes by the alkane bonded silica, the limitations of this technique require a particle free product of relatively low viscosity operating within the range of a pH 228 and the extracted product should have a molecular weight at or below 2000, as I mentioned at the beginning of this presentation we wanted you to learn more about a very promising new industrial process technology and we certainly hope that the time spent with us has given you some insight into supercritical extraction at Milton Roy we've always sought to provide are many fine customers with the highest quality products the best fluid metering technology available and the latest in applications development we would be pleased to assist you and your colleagues and not only supercritical extraction but any fluid metering application for Milton or a company this is Jack Kelly, thank you very much for watching",0.8739237792592592,0.72288924,0.91283864
jtxw0178,"we've been privileged today to listen to a number of excellent presentations and its really a formidable challenge for me to try and summarize all this up somewhat off the cuff since I only just finished scribbling some notes for Daryl, okay but I did do it Darrell, I'll tell you there was one thing that I really felt good about out of the presentations today and that's the fact that they still need us and they need us badly, what I didn't realize is that they were the legal department, our keynote speaker today dr. Ron Sharon really gave us a detailed picture of the vision of the business environment during the next decade as he sees it, the creation of value he said is the real task of an R&D organization that's what we do we create value to create value there must be some opportunities it's dr. Sharon pointed out it's by looking at for changes paradigms or patterns that's the first time I really understood what somebody meant by Paradigm by the way I feel good about it, if we can discover those patterns then we can find the opportunities dr. Sharon listed five patterns that will dominate the next decade the first is the political pattern closed economies are no longer viable he said this trend leads to a change in the economic pattern, the standard of living will improve, by the year 2000 and additional half billion people rise above the subsistence level and be consumers of our products that's a tremendous increase for us in the world market, the next point he made was globalization, major point he made was that there will be a significant shortage of Global Talent, lastly patterns of organization will change also he said we must learn to integrate decisions on a cross-country and cross-functional basis, what will be the results he asked of these changing patterns dr. Sharon is optimistic I like the 5,000 plus Dow okay that means that our stock has to get to it at least 140 or so, but he also said there will be some minor problems but that the 90s in itself should be a decade of peace and growth for Harold Burley said get rid of your port stock okay, but the decade ahead as he pointed out will be one of change as a consequence he said it will be less forgiving decade businesses must maintain their productivity quality speed and top-line growth or they will fail that's what R&D has to help with, his presentation was particularly appropriate lead in for our first session today the first speaker was Rick Tisdale from the Leo Burnett company is topic vision of the future consumer is Paramount importance to our d, change is once again the key issue but in this case change concerning the American Consumer, societal changes such as demographic changes increasing immigration regionalization and changes to the family structure have resulted in consumer diversification, same kinds of issues that we heard from Daryl and we heard from Jerry they're already happening this diversification leads to product customization and focused rather than masked marketing the computer-based technology of the information age and this was another good thing I heard I heard for the first time that we will see by the year 2000 a real measurable Roi, work computer, I have bought a lot of computers I have said that are going to get a return on it and I have gotten more computers but that's all okay I think for the first time Rick made me feel good that I will see a real Roi, okay, let me get back the arrows yes provided us this computers provided us the tools to identify segments and Target products appropriately, okay needs and wants, maybe very different for each one of our segments some are obvious low fat low cholesterol foods for an aging population convenient Foods were the growing number of single adults families, and some other consumers may require considerable consumer requirements make require considerable Rd consumer interaction to identify, the bottom line is that the role of technology and p.m. companies must increase as the products proliferate not only in the area of production but in communication and distribution as well, next we heard the regulatory environment will change during the next decade as well Chuck wall pointed out that we can anticipate a growing number of regulations in the future, and although this is true worldwide he pointed out that it's particularly true in the u.s. because we become a risk aversive Society, we cannot become a risk of versus society in R&D we can't afford it, pn companies will face regulatory constraints from a number of different federal agencies he pointed out particularly FDA at PC EPA and OSHA, in addition product liability litigation is to be considered a regulatory process we must take a proactive stance in the regulatory Arena to ensure that the issue of reducing risk to society is balanced by the issues of consumer benefit and economic growth, this kind of proactive response that Chuck was talking about he indicated it had to start with the R&D organization Rd must face the challenge of conveying an accurate picture of risk to the consumer we must provide the company with unimpeachable data to support product claims and lastly we must attempt to influence regulations through the use of good science in order to benefit the company, Panini and the consumers as well, the quote Chuck lawyers can help questionable, but the scientist must play the biggest role in producing the answers that they're going to use, the next speaker was dr. Alexander horniman who outline future resource challenges that we in our D are likely to face in the next decade he challenged each one of us to answer the question are you leaders we had our D must be leaders to cope with future changes, because as he said the existing way of doing things will not be good enough in the next decade, he suggested five human resource initiatives which are required to maintain an organization that can adapt to change, these initiatives are to create a Global Learning organization focus on the consumer Rd must use business thinking, we have to share the Rd learning process with the rest of the organization because we don't implement we don't get anywhere, and we must maintain critical skills leadership, in conclusion to create a world-class R&D organization requires different assumptions and actions different learning practices a different focus and one phrase that we hear a lot of doing more with less, this is budget time again, for all of us and thank you, well the previous three speakers presented issues that are key to being able to plan and Implement R&D programs in the 90 the last two speakers gave us a fascinating picture concerning the changes that two particular areas of Technology will undergo in the next decade, dr. Jerry Edelman, gave us what I believe has to be a startling version of the human brain he presented evidence that the organization of the brain is quite different from a digital computer, so much for neural networks huh, and gave us an exciting preview of devices which like the brain have the capacity to learn, dr. Kumar Patel at eighteen T describes some of the key developments of physical science that will have a significant impact in the 90s examples were drawn from materials discoveries and techniques the end of his presentation with a message that all of us really ought to take the heart, it is not enough to invent technical inventions must be extended to social conventions we have to implement and we have them for math in the market, second session dealt with Philip Morris needs regarding the future technology presented by Jerry, some of the Technologies he pointed out that we need at Philip Morris USA to be pursuing included process sensors and the kind of Technology necessary be able to use that information to control processes and provide the flexibility in manufacturing, we also have to pursue areas such as combustion physics so I guess we'll keep our physicist, we have to pursue some catalysis, we don't have the necessary talent in house we may be here in about how to do that kind of thing on the outside tomorrow, we have to pursue paper chemistry selective filtration and genetic engineering has a place in our research,and they're all get up and complain about being last he forgot I had to get up, no one everybody wants to have a Miller, but he pointed out for the food and beverage Industries what our needs their Innovative products that will deliver true convenience to the consumer, he covered the role of diet on health and well-being and indicated that that activity alone will be driving a good portion of the product as well as package development, everywhere as Darrell pointed out environmental issues will drive a significant portion of our R&D resources over the next decade, we will be working either for Chuck wall or for Rick Warren idea at least a large portion of the time, if there was one word which I think best described the definition of R&D and barrels talk would have to be flexibility, he stressed it it's stressed everywhere we're not flexible not going to be able to react to the market opportunities, they're all wrapped it up basically with with what I got out of it was some tremendous emphasis into specific areas one of them consumer and knowledge of the consumer a problem we all have been pursued and the second one was the area of Packaging, a problem that our friends in Europe are facing significantly to a greater extent and quicker than we are but something that's going to face all of us, so that's what we went through today that's the start tonight we're going to get some more good words, at dinner, but tomorrow we're going to get a chance to hear some more opportunities and some more directions on where Rd ought to be going at Philip Morris companies in the next decade it is now 525 we're running about 25 minutes behind you still have time to go have a Miller it's Miller time and we'll see you at dinner thank you",0.862105775492958,0.6095217,0.9128387

Robert jackler the preeminent tobacco advertising scholar in the country will help us answer that question after today we hope to understand how Jewel appealed to youth while simultaneously avoiding detection by adults we will hear about Jules efforts to Market directly to kids including how Jewel entered schools under the guise of anti vaping presentations then, after all School Personnel left the assembly room in a lot of these schools unfortunately these Jewel presenters told kids that their vaping tools were safe we will hear from the parents of kids who sat through one such presentation to devoted mothers were so angry that they founded a nationwide advocacy group I suspect that of all the schools Jewel entered it regrets going into that one the most because it incited the riot, righteous anger that only comes from parents who feel that their kids were being exploited, we will also hear that Jewels targeting a vulnerable populations was not limited to kids real leery will describe Jewels attempts to test its Market on Native Americans Jewel tried to pay her tribe to give free Jewel starter kits to tribal members Jewel told the tribe that its product is healthy and proposed pushing it through the tribes medical professionals Jewel appeared to think it could get away with this on tribal land and it tried to ensure no one else found out, about it the jewel product itself contains very high nicotine levels three to six times the amount of the E-Cigarettes that came before it it's formulation eliminated the harsh taste that would have previously accompanied that much nicotine and further masked it with flavors flavors, which appeal to youth kids do not grasp this 63 percent of users aged 15 to 24 do not know Jewel contains nicotine they think that it only has flavorings and mistakenly believe that the product is not harmful dr. winnik off will help to explain the health impact of Youth Jewel use perhaps we can better understand what led to parents sending Jewel letters like one from June of last year, dating quote my daughter is highly addicted to the nicotine and Zhu Ling it is very sad and occurred very quickly over the past several months she is 16 and now has addictive behaviors that she never had before jeweling such as stealing money and other teens Jewels she also lies in sneaks out at night to get a nicotine fix perhaps we can understand why a therapist wrote to Jewel in July of last year disheartened at how many of her teen clients, to her about Jewel addiction talking about how quote desperately they need to vape unquote she expressed concern about kids using Jewel to quote self-medicate from mental health issues like anxiety and depression, we will also examine what about the jewel device makes it so attractive to teens it is discrete in a way that no cigarettes are prior e-cigarettes were it puts off a limited cloud of aerosol and it's smell doesn't linger it's small and before Jewel was a household name parents could have looked right past it thinking it was a thumb drive in fact I've had one in my hand during this entire statement, Jewel hasn't provided satisfactory answers for these open questions it is my sincere hope that our hearings today and tomorrow will help us better understand Jewels role in this terrible epidemic and point us towards solutions to prevent teen vaping addiction, the chair now recognizes the distinguished ranking member from Texas mr. Cloud 45 minutes for an opening statement thank you chairman and thank you Witnesses for appearing this morning for decades now we've known that smoking is dangerous and linked to cancer cigarettes result in approximately four hundred eighty thousand preventable deaths in America each year these deaths are only preventable however if individuals are able to stop smoking for years now smoking has been on the decline but we are far from a, eradicating it it's clear that the methods for cessation that existed just a few years ago quitting cold turkey using nicotine gum or patches sometimes simply are not enough recent study suggests that electronic cigarettes could be part of a broader tobacco control strategy and could be considered viable components to cessation there's a growing consensus in the scientific community that electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional test tobacco products in, practice study commissioned by the Public Health Service of England found that e-cigarettes were 95% less harmful than tobacco cigarettes and for the summer for this reason some smokers wanting to quit have turned to e-cigarettes as a cessation aid though the FDA has yet to determine that E-cigarettes are effective for this purpose other Studies have found that e-cigarette use was associated with nearly twice the rate of successful smoking cessation than other nicotine replacement therapies and we needed we do need to be clear about one thing, why no one wants kids to use tobacco no one wants kids vaping and no one wants vaping companies to Target children with advertisements it's illegal for anyone under 18 to purchase and to consume these products the Tobacco Control Act of 2009 also applies to e-cigarettes members of Congress drafted and passed legislation that they that sorry members of Congress draft and pass legislation that process should always begin with strict Fidelity to facts and research, in order to obtain these facts and here the research the questions I hope to have answers to today are are the public health benefits what are if any the public health benefits to e-cigarettes can electronic cigarettes be part of an overall tobacco control strategy and if so how do we do so in a way that ensures the kids are protected and many more questions that I hope will hit her answers to today as dr. Scott Gottlieb I believe said two three, of adult smokers have stated they want to quit they know it's hard and they probably tried many times to quit we must recognize the potential for Innovation to lead to less harmful products if two-thirds of smokers in this country want to quit which is a great thing members of Congress could be cautious and moving forward with making transitions more difficult than it already is like anything else whether its use, whether it's use access to marijuana or alcohol the first line of defense is engagement by parents our parents schools and local communities to educate children about the risk and ensure Healthy Lifestyles I hope you have a productive discussion today thank you very much for being here, thank you mr. Cloud now I'd like to turn to our Witnesses first of all thank you all for joining us today we very much appreciate you taking time out of your very busy schedules and thank you to all of you in the audience for coming here on an otherwise slow fake news day, today we are joined by Miss Meredith Berkman who is the co-founder of parents against vaping e-cigarettes also miss Ray O'Leary a member of the turtle Mountain band of the Chippewa and a public health analyst and researcher with Missouri breaks Industries research in South Dakota dr. Jonathan win a cough a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics dr. Robert jackler who is the Sewell professor and departmental, chair at Stanford University Medical School and a practicing surgeon and finally dr. Raymond neora of the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences of the College of global Public Health at you New York University thank you all for coming, if you would all please rise, and raise your right hand I will Begin by swearing you in, do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God, thank you let the record show that the witness is answered in the affirmative thank you and please be seated without objection your written statement will be made part of the record with that Miss Berkman you are now recognized for five minutes, and let me just quickly explain the lighting system here so you have five minutes and there's is a countdown on the clock green means you're in good shape unlike with stoplights yellow means speed up and red means stop so with that please please begin Miss Berkman, not stressful at all thank you very much good morning Jaron krishnamurthi and Congressman Cloud thank you for your words and distinguished members of the House oversight committee on economics and consumer policy I'm Meredith Berkman and I represent parents against vaping e-cigarettes we call it pave a Grassroots group founded over a year ago by three concerned mom's we already have groups of activated parents across the country from California to New York and places in between we have, with us here today from Texas from Georgia from Virginia New York New Jersey Etc my co-founders Dina alessi and Dorian Furman are behind me with members of our families between us we have nine kids between the ages of 7 to 19 along with our friend Mimi bobeck also here we created pave in response to the jiulong epidemic that is you said seemed to come out of nowhere yet experts consider one of the most serious adolescent Public Health crisis, I seized our country has faced for decades our goal today is to give voice to the 3.6 million teens who are vaping most of them dueling this most recent figure from the CDC is already outdated and as you said between 2017 and 2018 there was a 78 percent rise in the use of these products by high school students and a 4th percent rise in use by middle school students and experts believe, that the new figures do this fall will likely be much higher because nothing has happened to have them go down we hear from Desperate parents every day who contact us seeking resources information and help for their Jewel dependent nicotine addicted kids but there is not yet any FDA approved treatment for this kind of team nicotine addiction I will share very briefly just one or two stories because they're heartbreaking and they come from every state represented here, here on the panel and probably for the every state of people in this room from Massachusetts are pavé Advocate Christian bow parley on speaking about her son Cade a hockey player described how he developed a cough and complained he was not able to breathe while skating he became distant Moody irritable and had extreme bouts of anger a very common thing that people report our home environment was toxic and it turns out that Kate has restrictive lung disease he, it's inhalers and oral steroids he'd been smoking a pot add a the equivalent of more than a pack of cigarettes a day for years for three years Kelly Canard from North Carolina is here with her son Luca whose addiction was so severe he spent 39 days as an inpatient at rehab in California and Kelly said we back we began living with a stranger are straight A students grades dropped to F he it, it was the extreme anger it turned out our 14 year old had a substance abuse problem and that substance was Jewel and now I want to share a personal story the story of how Jewel went after our kids and their friends by coming into their school without the knowledge of the school or of us concerned parents Jewel sent a representative to talk to our kids about its product under the guise of Education, on April 3rd 2017 my then 15 year old son Caleb who's here told us there have been an anti addiction talk at school for the ninth grade the teachers left the room and the man named Ali gave a confusing talk about Jewel telling them it was not for kids but for adults it was much safer than cigarettes the FDA would approve it any day when Ali was done Caleb and his friend Phillip Dorian son went up to talk to him a lie repeated the, was for adults not kids then he took out his sleek-looking Jewel showed the boys how it worked and called it the iPhone of Vapes, and that's when we mom's decided to fight back we had discovered a few months before that our kids were doing at home right under our noses which is also very common it doesn't mean you're a bad parent if your kids are drooling its stealth by Design we knew that nicotine was harmful to our kids brains and as we researched and put pieces together we learned the jewels deceptive Behavior seemed to be part of its marketing strategy in, California a retired school superintendent was offering schools in his State and the Massachusetts money if they would implement the anti Jewel curriculum that harder was offering a man named Bruce harder was offering I'm Jules behalf we came across the Stanford Medical school's tobacco prevention tool kit with an odd disclaimer that we immediately realized was a reference to Jewel taking information it didn't it shouldn't have none of this is surprising as I, jewel is stealth by Design Jewell says it no longer restocks retail orders of the flavors that research has proven are hooking the kids yet just the other day in a one-block radius in two different stores I was able to buy these Menthol I'm sorry these mango pods that Jewell says are no longer on the market but they're still online and that's the problem if Jewel really wants to slowly, the youth vaping epidemic and keep younger kids from starting they will immediately remove all flavors from the market including Menthol and mint one of the most popular kid flavors and they will stop spending millions of dollars on lobbyists, to oppose sensible legislation that paves parents and are many Coalition partners are fighting for all over this country to restrict youth access to Jewel and other products we hope today's hearing motivates members of Congress on both sides we all care about kids to hold Jewel accountable not only for the epidemic but for its predatory practices and for causing harm to so many kids in this country it is not a political issue, but a moral one and if we don't take action now we Face an entire generation of kids addicted to nicotine who are human guinea pigs for the jewel experiment overall thank you thank you Miss Berkman now mrs. O'Leary you're on the clock, good morning committee members and thank you for the opportunity to explain how Jules marketing to minority populations is relevant to this hearing my name is real Larry and I'm serving as a fact witness representing the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe which I will refer to a serious tea I'm the founder of the Chun-Li tobacco Coalition which is a Grassroots anti-tobacco Coalition on the reservation the China Coalition opposes the use of all commercial tobacco products because of the tobacco industry's historical targeting of American Indians which has contributed to the health disparities and Death on the, the Cheyenne River Reservation in January and February of 2019 three representatives from Jewel use the historic tactic at the tobacco tobacco industry by handing out free product to tribal decision-makers and offering a switching program to the CRC health committee Joe proposed that Healthcare professionals from the Sierras City Health Department refer smokers that are 21 years or older to they're switching program using their referral American Indian patients would enroll in jewels online portal by entering personal data and health behaviors,Joel proposed to sell starter kits valued at $50 to the tribe for $5 a piece the tribe would then turn around and provide free Jewel starter kits to patients who enroll in the switching program throughout Jewels presentation they made multiple claims that their product is effective for smoking cessation and less harmful than Tobacco Company products these claims as well as Jules actions to hand out free product are all clear violations of the family smoking prevention and Tobacco Control Act Jewel indicated that their investment in the tribes switching program was worth over six hundred thousand dollars, to the tribe initially some tribal council members were convinced that Jewel switching program could help members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe quit smoking improving their quality of life for smokers and eventually resulting in fewer health care costs to the tribe despite initial interest in Jewel switching program the Serie C health committee members wisely requested written documentation of jewels switching program proposal draw the not provide written documentation detailing the the program as requested instead they sent a mutual non-disclosure agreement to the tribes attorney general with untrue, formation that the non-disclosure agreement had already been distressed discussed by this year's see health committee the non-disclosure agreement was not signed as a result Jewel has not returned to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe earlier this month the CRS T health committee unanimously approved a resolution that declares quote serious tea shall neither solicit nor accept any tobacco electronic smoking device or nicotine related funding or sponsorship and quote this resolution has is currently being considered by their seriously Tribal Council as well as several other Sovereign tribal Nations and the national Indian Health, Board the China Coalition emphatically opposes the offer Jewel made to the CRC health committee for many reasons including grave safety concerns regarding exploding e-cigarette batteries and nicotine poisoning of children and unknown but probable long-term health risks such as cardiovascular disease and cancer even though the switching program is intended for adult smokers the China Coalition has great concern that our American Indian youth will begin using Jewel due to increased access and a highly concealable and flavorful product this concern is supported by the data that American Indian, school students in South Dakota are using e-cigarettes three times more than their white counterparts another concern is that Jewel has not been proven to be safe or effective for smoking cessation in fact there's a growing body of evidence that e-cigarette users smoke more and quit less it's true that some smokers have successfully quit smoking using e-cigarettes like Jewel but it has also been found that for every one adult smoker who quits using an e-cigarette 81 adolescents will initiate e-cigarette use clearly Jewel and other secret E-cigarettes are being used for more than, alternative to Smoker's this year's team may have looked like an easy target for Jewel because of the fda's inability to enforce tobacco regulations or published reports of our 51% adult smoking prevalence coupled with our genetic propensity to addiction or maybe they were drawn to the CRS T because of our young population based or a recent status is the poorest county in the nation Jewel did not provide an acceptable justification for their choice to offer the switching program to Sovereign tribal Nations I would challenge the members of the subcommittee to uncover why jewel is, in partnering with tribes and exactly how this partnership will improve lives of CRS team members as Jewel claims it will as an American Indian women educated in public health and knowledgeable about the tobacco disparities that exist among indigenous populations I'm putting my words on the record that the scenario of tobacco industry targeting American Indians and exploiting tribal sovereignty has played out for far too long I put a great deal of thought into my decision to testify at this hearing today in the end it was the lakotas seventh generation belief that helped me reach, CH my decision to testify what happened on serious tea and other tribes is simply too important not to be shared it's time to take action to prevent Jewel and all tobacco companies from preying on at yet risk populations as you consider possible actions and policy following this hearing I challenge you to learn from the Lakota people seven generation belief that in every decision leaders must consider how it will affect our descendants descendants Seven Generations into the future thank you, thank you mrs. O'Leary dr. winnik off you have five minutes good good morning chairman krishnamoorthy ranking member Cloud members of the subcommittee my name is dr. Jonathan win a cough I'm a practicing pediatrician at Massachusetts General Hospital and I have over 20 years of experience caring for children and adolescents I'm here today representing the American Academy of Pediatrics a professional medical organization representing over 60, 10,000 pediatricians across the United States Jewel use among adolescents has reached epidemic proportions and I see the impact of this everyday in my own practice every one of my teenage patients and even many of my preteen patients either uses e-cigarettes or has friends who use them many of my patients have wildly incorrect beliefs about E-Cigarettes they know that cigarettes are dangerous but believe that jewel is harmless I have to explain that e-cigarettes, it's do not have the same positive health benefits as the fruit flavors that they copy rather e-cigarette liquid contains an addiction to nicotine and number of toxins and carcinogens E-cigarettes are also not good for growing lungs they're particularly bad for children with asthma they can cause serious lung conditions including hypersensitivity pneumonitis the FDA has a publicly warned now about increasing reports of seizures in children who use e-cigarettes my patients are often not aware of, Jules massive nicotine content and that one Jewel pod contains as much nicotine as 20 cigarettes they also don't understand that nicotine dependence impacts areas of the brain that control executive function memory and mood nicotine addiction can take hold in only a few days especially in the developing adolescent brain that is particularly vulnerable to addiction e cigarette addiction concerns us because use of e-cigarettes can lead to combustible tobacco use compared to adolescents who do not use, e-cigarettes those who use e-cigarettes are three point five times more likely to begin smoking traditional cigarettes many of my patients use Jewel daily and find it impossible to stop nicotine withdrawal can cause headaches insomnia irritability anxiety and depression yet doctors lack effective tools to help adolescents stop using Jewel the only Surefire way to eliminate these cigarette use in adolescents has to stop it before it starts luckily we already know, needs to be done we need to make e-cigarettes less appealing to children need to make them harder for children to access we need to make them regulated appropriately by the FDA first and foremost we must address Jules flavors Jewel pods come in a number of sweet flavors including mint mango and creme youth surveys show that e-cigarette flavors are one of the primary reasons teens try e-cigarettes yet flavors also help mask the harsh Taste of nicotine making repeated use more likely and increasing addiction, Jewel has chosen to keep mint and Menthol flavored pods available for sale everywhere it is completely false to suggest that mint is not attractive to children from candy canes to toothpaste children are introduced to meant from a young age in tobacco products menthols anesthetic properties cool the throat and make it easier for children to inhale the poison when jewelry moved some of its other flavors from stores I saw the majority of my, My Jewel using patients which to Mint nevertheless children are still gaining access to other flavored Jewel pods even though they are now sold online if the products are available for sale somewhere children will get their hands on them, we must eliminate child-friendly flavors from all tobacco products we urge Congress to pass legislation immediately to prohibit flavors including Minton Menthol from tobacco products mr. chairman members of the subcommittee jewel is a fatally flawed product a recent study showed that 15 to 17 year olds are 16 times more likely to report Jewel use than 25 to 34 year-olds even though Jewel claims its, ducks are only intended for adults when so much of the product ends up in the hands of children it's time we declare it a failed product the American Academy of Pediatrics believe that jewel is a public health threat that must be removed from the market as soon as possible Jewel and products like it are eroding the progress we've made in reducing teen tobacco use teenagers today are using e-cigarettes when many of them would otherwise never have used a tobacco product Jewel, must be held to account for the epidemic it has created and Congress and the administration must take action to end it thank you, thank you dr. winnik off dr. jackler you have five minutes,thank you for the opportunity to testify before your subcommittee today almost all smoking begins during adolescence it's part of teen Rebellion typically commencing between the ages of 12 and 19 it would indeed be a very rare 40 year old who woke up and said hey I think I'll start smoking today and once a team becomes hooked on nicotine it's exceedingly difficult to quit many are stuck with a lifelong addiction now from the, beginning Jewel professed in Noble mission of improving the lives of a billion smokers instead they have spurred an epidemic of nicotine addiction amongst youth so how did Jules stray so far from its stated Mission as a majority of smokers in America are ages 30 to 60 joules should have designed their advertising to connect to a middle-aged audience over the first year could we have the slides please Garrett,okay over the first year after Jewel launched in June 2015 it held at least a series of 50 highly stylized parties with youth oriented entertainment in cities Across America thousands of young people were given free Jewels Often by tract of young girls Jewels initial campaign called vaporized was designed by an advertising agency whose goal it was to create a cult-like following, and they succeeded beyond their Wildest Dreams vaporize featured models in their 20s and trendy appearing poses and exhibiting behaviors more typical of underage teens than mature adults tobacco Ivory advertisers have long known that these imagery's are exactly how to Target underage kids just blacks week in a televised documentary on CNBC The Jewel co-founder Adam Bowen claimed that the 2015 vat vaporized campaign only, lasted less than six months it was lifestyle oriented and quote had no impact upon sales lifestyle oriented it was obviously if we could see the images it's obviously youth oriented in that way now contradicting Mr Bowen Jules co-founder James mans he's a mere seven months after Jewel launch bragged now we're actually the fastest growing e-cigarette company in the world so today they say, say their early advertising which was patently youth-oriented made no difference but in fact at the time they were bragging there with their most rapid in the growing in the world this is either revisionist history or intentional deception I'll let you be the judge from its Inception Jewel mostly advertised on social media especially Instagram which skews heavily towards youth Jewel paid influencers who are social media stars with a large number of online followers to praise Jewel Jewel, it's reached by the use of hashtags which which became online gathering places for teenagers under intense regulatory pressure Jewel halted its own social media postings in November 2018 however this was a hollow gesture it didn't matter much and the reason was that Viral peer-to-peer promotion amongst teens assured a massive visibility of their products on an ongoing basis for example after Jewel, could its own postings last November Community post and hashtag Jewel bye kids Serge tripled now there's five hundred and forty thousand posts and millions of views of that youthful material Drew leadership claims we were completely surprised by the use of usage of the product co-founder James man sees Bragg's we are the most educated company the most diligent the most well-researched they are indeed a data driven company, they know their Market to whom their products are distributed and the identity of their customers the New York Times interviewed a former Jewel manager who disclosed that Jewel knew that their products were becoming popular amongst underage users within the first few months on the market so dual professes to be a technology which disrupts big tobacco like many Tech startups as the money starts rolling in Jewel made many compromises to their Grand Vision what should have become a no, off ramp for adult smokers instead has become a heavily traveled on ramp to nicotine addiction amongst teens many of whom graduate to traditional combustible cigarettes from a policy point of view the best way to eliminate adult smoking is to keep teens from starting in the first place so Jules recent partnership with Altria combines the leading youth initiation cigarette Marlboro with the leading youth initiation e-cigarette Jewel that their agree, then specifies joint Jewel Marlboro marketing is of great concern so Jewel has been unmasked for its hypocrisy rather than obsoleting big tobacco jewel is very much part of it it is as though they lit the kindling stood by making no effort to contain the resulting fire even stoked it and when the fire department came Express shock and dismay about the resulting major conflagration while loudly protesting that their actions had absolutely nothing to do, with it thank you, thank you dr. jackler dr. nayara you are on the clock thank you mr. chairman and members of the committee thank you for holding this important hearing on a topic of great concern to the nation's public health and I'm privileged to appear before you this morning to testify about the challenges we Face regarding youth use of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products my name is dr. Ray and I or I'm a clinical psychologist professor of Social and, Behavioral Sciences and epidemiology at the College of global Public Health that you know New York University and I've spent my entire professional career engaged in research on understanding and treating tobacco dependence and finding in testing ways to help smokers quit smoking, as a public health and tobacco use scientist I to share concerns about youth tobacco use including vaping for the record I believe no youth should be using any tobacco or nicotine containing product or any drug for that matter we should do all we can to discourage youth use by providing appropriate education and counseling and by making it difficult to purchase such products I believe also believe that companies that manufacture and sell they paying products should do, all they can to make sure that products are marketed only to adult smokers and I take some comfort in the fact that marketing strategies and health claims will eventually be subject to the US Food and Drug Administration review and approval during the fall of 2018 the FDA and the US Centers for Disease Control and prevention expressed acute concern about youth vaping when they looked at data from National surveys, and this prompted dr. Scott Gottlieb who was the FDA commissioner at the time to declare that youth vaping is an epidemic we this concern was reinforced by data coming from the National Youth tobacco survey in 2018 when the data were eventually released to to the public we looked at it ourselves and we can indeed confirm that past 30-day vaping had, East from the prior year and while an increase in uses of concern our analysis showed that most adolescent vaping was occasional and that most regular use was concentrated in adolescents who had already been smokers and this is and I think this is an important Point yes we need to be concerned about vaping but we also need to be concerned about use of other tobacco products, and we also looked at youth who had never used tobacco products and thankfully vaping rates were quite low again this is not to minimize the importance of concern about youth vaping cigarette smoking remains a major concern here in the United States of America and I'd like, to also emphasize another point which is that, e-cigarettes have the potential to help adult smokers stop smoking and we've seen evidence accumulating showing that adult smokers they use e-cigarettes can quit smoking regular cigarettes Studies have come out for example in the New England Journal of Medicine indicating the same just last week a survey reported that smokers who switched to e-cigarettes and use them every day were significantly more likely to quit smoking compared to those who did not use e-cigarettes, Mets, and these results are important because we know that despite their effectiveness smokers don't often use quitting methods such as nicotine replacement therapy or other medications so as they stand now E-cigarettes are consumer product that is proving to be very popular with smokers and helping them to actually quit smoking cigarettes quitting smoking is the number one Health priority for cigarette smokers and we need to use all the tools available, to help reduce this burden which prematurely claims the lives of over half a million Americans every year so currently about 38 million adults in the u.s. smoke cigarettes and clearly this this is a man ought to be a huge Public Health priority and I'd like to close by saying, I think that this set of issues both youth tobacco nicotine use and adult smoking have been portrayed as at odds with one another and they really should not be and that we in the Public Health Community and Congress ought to find ways where we can do both I think we're smart enough to figure out how but I don't think we have all the answers yet thank you very much, thank you dr. nayara I now recognize myself for five minutes of questioning first of all mrs. Berkman and mrs. Furman after you discovered that a presenter representing Jewel gave a closed assembly at your children's School you research the issue and formed an advocacy group to inform parents around the country about the dangers of adolescent e-cigarette use thank you for your continued advocacy as a parent of three young children myself including a teenager I was, actor here Jewel had access to children without the presence of teachers or administrators and without parental permission Jewel continues to partner with youth organizations across the country so it's important to understand what Outreach looks like on their part mrs. Berkman and mrs. Furman I'd like to ask a couple questions of your son's if that's okay yes Philip and Caleb can you please come to the table for a couple minutes, I'd like to First address Caleb Caleb what grades were you and Phillip in the year of the jewel presentation on 9th grade can you just speak directly into the microphone ninth grade thank you what were students told about the presentation before it begin we were told that we were having a mental health / addiction seminar that we have three times a year and the teachers are told to leave the room so it's a safe space, kids to talk did most of your classmates believe Jewel was safe prior to the presentation I think many kids were already drooling and had their doubts to if it was safe but I think a lot of kids, still thought it was possibly dangerous did the presenter ever mention his connection to Jewel and were your teachers in the room when he spoke he did mention his connection to Jewel and my teachers were not in the room when he spoke did the presenter ever say that Jewel was safe yes did the prisoner call Jewel quote-unquote totally safe more than once yes what impacted those quote unquote totally safe comments have on your, classmates some of whom may have already started vaping for my classmates who are already vaping it was a sigh of relief because now they were able to vape without any concern for their kids who had never been Julian that were more likely to try after hearing it was quote unquote totally safe I can't say for sure but I'm I believe that after this meeting kids were more inclined to vape because now they thought it was just a, flavor device that didn't have any harmful substances in it you and Philip approach the presenter when the assembly concluded what motivated you to to even approach him in the first place I believe the presenter was sending mixed messages by saying jewel is totally safe and following up every totally safe statement with but we don't want you as customers and I saw a mixed message being sent and I believe that the presenter was playing on the, a side of teens where when teens are told not to do something they are more likely to do it Philip let me ask you a couple questions what was your experience speaking to the presenter, so we went out and talked to him and Caleb asked a question about what can you do if your friend is addicted to nicotine Philip were you addicted to Jewel at the time of this presentation was and when Caleb ask the presenter what he should do if he had a friend that was addicted to nicotine was Caleb referring to you he was how did the presenter answer Caleb's question of how he could help his nicotine addicted friend namely you since Caleb was not specific on what kind of nicotine, and who's addicted to other was an e-cigarette or cigarettes on the speaker thought that he was talking about cigarettes and he said that he should mention Jewel to the his friend and because that's a safer alternative than smoking cigarettes and it would be better for the kid to you so let me get this straight he wanted you to switch from a combustible cigarette to Jewel yeah how did the presenter demonstrate the product to he didn't use it but he did take it out and show it to us, okay this is very disturbing Behavior to say the least a person connected to Jewel pulled out a jewel device to demonstrate its safety to teenagers and then lied about the product being quote unquote totally safe did he say anything else about whether the government had approved you'll he mentioned that the FDA was about to come out and say that Jewel was 99% safer than cigarettes and he said that that would happen very soon, soon and that I was in FDA approval while the talk was going on thank you Caleb and Phillip let me ask Dorian Phillips mother to say a couple of words here, Dorian thank you for coming today and Q your son Philip just stated he was addicted to Jewel yes how did his addiction impact your family it was difficult and at first we didn't understand what was going on as a young 14 year old he was interested in so many different things from surfing to cooking to his little sister and I started to find these flash drives in these these green plastic caps in his pockets and I didn't really know what it was at first, so he kept saying you know they were they belong to a friend and we'd have fights about it and I figured out what it was because I Googled the name on the side and it was difficult he he changed kind of overnight he started spending a lot of time in his room in the dark he became Moody we we had a very contentious relationship I became very suspicious obviously and and I think he didn't really understand what was going on himself and and neither did we, thank you Dorian let me, now recognize ranking member Cloud 45 minutes of questioning, thank you chairman mr. Parkman I'm curious the reaction a I assume you approached School Board principal what was the reaction the school had no idea that the outside group had brought a jewel representative into the school the school had those who had hired a group that had yes and we believe that the outside group was, Eve definitely but in good faith because when I called to ask about this presentation the staffer who answered the phone said oh you found the right person I was researching anti Jewel education online and I came across the name of a woman named Julie Henderson who was listed then I no longer on the Jewel website as its youth prevention coordinator and then she called and this woman Miss, Orson said I have the perfect person and sent a lie okay thank you Doctor Naya Naya Rivera did I pronounce that right yes okay could you explain the difference from a health perspective I guess between a traditional cigarette and an e-cigarette well is there one yeah there are many many differences you know traditional cigarettes you know consists of a preparation of tobacco leaves which, when burned create you know smoke and contains roughly 7,000 different chemicals most of which are not good for the for the human body e-cigarettes contain far fewer ingredients in addition to nicotine usually something like propylene glycol glyceryl which are you know commonly found ingredients for example in foodstuffs and and some flavorings and this in general just the difference in terms of the, number of compounds in E-Cigarettes for see cigarettes makes makes the e-cigarettes in general say for although they probably can vary from product to product a lot of the safety of e-cigarettes depends on temperature control so for example if products have adequate temperature control they tend to be you know less toxic, okay I guess we've known cigarettes for a while cause cancer and talking about prevention I remember in third grade seeing a lungs sitting in a jar that have somebody who passed away from cigarette use but I guess what I'm trying to get down to is what what are the health effects of the combustible side of it and what is the health effects of the nicotine side well yeah and that's actually an important you know point to raise so, if we look at nicotine in and of itself it's not risk-free but it's probably a lot less toxic that compared to the other chemicals that come out of cigarette smoke it's not risk so for example nicotine probably does not cause cancer it may have some small effects on existing cardiovascular disease and so forth you know it can you know the brain might have to adapt to, to you know having a drug on board these are neuro end up tations which are true for for for any drug but the nicotine itself is not the culprit when it comes to things like cancers least as far as We Know, okay we seem to have a kind of a competing set of facts here we have data that shows that teen e-cigarette use has gone up a lot and then dr. neera you mentioned that a lot of that's I guess transitional or is it is it not is it new use is it I guess if dr. Jacqueline doctor near if you can kind of clarify that a little bit for us to have better understanding of what's new use what's transitional use, yeah that's that's an important question that I don't think we have a good handle on yet because a lot of the surveys that we look at are what are called cross-sectional meaning it says dipstick or asset slicing time and you know we see kids that report to us over there using one or two days or you know every day and so forth and what we need are studies that track kids over time to actually see whether the ones who are starting out you know one or two days, go on to use more and but you know once again we don't know what the employee real implications are of these these different patterns of use and I you know want to emphasize share the concern that you know kids shouldn't be trying these products and they shouldn't be using them certainly shouldn't be using them on a on a frequent basis yeah the CDC data show a huge use over 2 million American High School students and many hundreds of thousands of middle class, school students fractured of them of course experiment and others become regular user I don't want to touch as a physician on The healthfulness Vaping you know if you start smoking today it's 20 30 40 years before you get emphysema or lung cancer nobody knows what it does to the human lung to Breathe In and Out aerosolized propylene glycol and Glycerine over and over it's an experiment frankly we will find out years from now the results the flavor and Industry knows that, at the compounds that we put into our food that are safe in your intestinal tract when you breathe them in so for example the classic example is butter popcorn microwave butter popcorn the diacetyl compounds in the industrial setting cause severe restrictive lung disease on the part of the industrial workers we're taking a wide variety of e-cigarette industry has taken flavor and chemicals thousands of different ones cotton candy and cookie flavors mix them with propylene glycol and then there, suppose over and over in the lungs we just don't know yet the long-term results there's no doubt in my mind that vaping is safer than conventional smoking but that doesn't mean that it's safe, thank you mr. Cloud I neck now recognize congresswoman Talib 45 minutes of questioning congresswoman thank you so much mr. chairman I want to thank all of the witnesses for being here and Miss Berkman is a mother I can sense your frustration I just want you to know being here just a short seven months and kind of hearing you know I don't call it you know some people call rhetoric to kind of discredit a lot of the things that were pushing for it I just want you to know you have the truth on your side and just be, be stronger for that because we don't need more studies we already know the truth here in the few years after duel was founded in 2015 it dominated the market through a targeted advertising campaign the seems to be a winning strategy as Jewel now accounts for 76 percent of the u.s. e-cigarette Market just simply staggering what I find troubling is that in the same time frame the rate of teen nicotine addiction sky, rocketed the CDC found 75 percent increase in e cigarette use among high school students from 2017 to 2018 so it's no coincidence to to me that teens who use e-cigarettes almost exclusively refer to the activity as drooling so Professor jackler you have studied Jewels marketing practices since the company started in 2015 based on your expertise should Jewel have been aware its marketing campaign would appeal to, Youth and teens the absolutely you know huge teenage fads don't happen by accident you know the Beatles and beanie babies were products of very clever promotional activities and so is drool now Jewel engaged ad agencies which are professionals and adding it sees understand very well the difference between marketing to Baby Boomers like newspapers radio broadcast TV and Jen zeros who are sit all day long on their phones look, it's social media now ad agencies follow the instructions of their clients they don't work independently they certainly the company knew very well when it chose to use Instagram who the heaviest users of Instagram where it's the underage youth by and large and the inside a report from The New York Times validates it so I don't think there's any question that Jewel knew that its actions were perpetuating the youth epidemic that happened within Jewel you are a professor at Stanford the same University that the, founders of Jewel attended as students have you ever met James Monte or Adam Bowen yes I met James muncie's and my research team we went up to Jewel last summer in August you know he was quite interesting he thanked us for the database that we have of 50,000 traditional tobacco ads online he said they were very helpful as they design Jewels advertising and this truck has so much that as the seven of us left the to our meeting was the very first thing we, about how surprising it was that he indicated that Jewel was grounded in traditional advertising and in fact we know very well having studied tobacco advertising that Jules marketing Faithfully recapitulates the methods used by the tobacco industry to Target young people and that includes Brands such as marble which they closely emulated American Spirit Newport there grew direct derivatives in Jewel advertising income in those so Jules mission statement asserts that a, aims to quote improve the lives of the world's 1 billion adult smokers do Jewels marketing practices which you have studied for years aligned with that stated Mission well not for its first three and a half years on the fourth year at at that point when already the youth fad was raging their ads became more calibrated to an adult audience and the channels that they used it as well they have now switch campaigns depicting middle-aged and older adults it's imprinted, paper and on television and no longer they're promoting on social media now this only happened long after there was a youth epidemic and it was because of the unwanted and intense and tension by attention by regulators and also interestingly as mr. muncey's pointed out when we visited with them they were concerned about their investors particularly National companies like Fidelity who is an early investor who certainly didn't want to be associated with products that were widely seen, you know it always leads to profits so last November Jewel deleted its Instagram and Facebook as you kind of accounted to but the explosion of their marketing had already had an impact on youth how do we continue to see initial marketing campaigns influence on kids on social media today yeah so Jewel taking off its own marketing didn't stop all of the jewel branded hashtags in there are dozens of them hash tag duel alone in the first three years and five months Jun 2015 22, November 2018 there about a quarter of a million post mostly by young people and hashtag Jewel since last November to now it doubled to over half a million and Professor yeah and I really do appreciate that but before it chairman it is important to know what was astounded me the most is they deleted Facebook Instagram but Jules Twitter followers half of them are under the age of 18 yeah and just and if I might say just because you delete them doesn't mean it never happened no thank you so much, thank you congresswoman next mr. Comer you're recognized for five minutes thank you mr. chairman and the topic of the Committee hearing today you use of electronic cigarettes and it's been mentioned today the potential possible correlation with tobacco and cigarettes dr. neela are you've conducted a lot of research and published several studies on this very topic, see how reliable of a predictor of future use of tobacco products is current use of vaping for youth, well there there is a statistical association between you know use of e-cigarettes and subsequent cigarette smoking but what we looked at in this we looked at this in the population assessment of tobacco and health study which is funded and sponsored by the the FDA and the NIH so we did find that but then we also found that if kids had in fact, started with a cigarette they were 20 times more likely to continue smoking a cigarette so so the message that we take from this is that you know use of all or any nicotine or tobacco containing products for kids probably will increase the risk for subsequent cigarette smoking the worst thing to start with would be with the with a combustible product like like a cigarette has the rate of decline in smoking among, adults and youth decreased or increased since 2010 when e-cigarettes started to rise in popularity well we've seen steady declines in you know cigarette smoking both in Youth and adult populations which we should you know take as good news we absolutely certainly have more work to do and and yes there is you know sort of a diverging of the trends with e-cigarettes picking up and use the cigarette, going down and that's the area of active research is to see whether those two things are actually connected with one another if e-cigarettes were a gateway to smoking wouldn't evident show uh substantial increase in smoking among Youth and Young adults by now well we don't see again we've seen you know a decrease in use of other tobacco products cigarettes in particular in youth so right now at least it doesn't appear that, at E-cigarettes are translating into subsequent use of cigarettes at least as far as we can tell right now this evidence show that teens are diverting to e-cigarettes instead of taking up smoking well that's an important question that I think we need more research to address kids are trying a lot of different products you know including vaping and we need to understand more about, who who are the high risk kids who you know might try a lot of products who may inadvertently become you know more addicted to nicotine we really need more and better understanding of those factors so that I think we can do a better job at you know doing some kind of intervention well I just want to make a point here that I'm certainly opposed to youth vaping, opposed to you smoking I'm not a smoker never have been but I am a farmer and I do represent probably the bigger the biggest tobacco growing District in America with without a doubt this is something that has been a big economic boom to Kentucky having said that we recognise the risks and the danger and the bad effects of, of cigarette use and tobacco use the industry I think is, has tried to do things to curb underage smoking I know that Senator McConnell has a bill that I support to raise the minimum wage to purchase cigarettes and I think that that's something that needed to be mentioned today that you know tobacco still legal and I know this is about e-cigarettes but I have to conclude with this because it's a big, to begin to stream my district and it's you know we in Kentucky you're not able to grow fruits and vegetables because of the climate so you're limited as to what types of crops you can grow it's still a legal industry and as long as it's still a legal industry I would rather the tobacco be grown and Kentucky by middle-class Farmers small farmers which is what who grow to Viagra that and importing tobacco from other countries but having said that I certainly want to work, with the my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure that youth use of e-cigarettes goes down and certainly as I've always been a proponent of doing everything we can to prevent underage smoking with that mr. chairman I yield back thank you mr. Comer congresswoman Presley you have five minutes thank you, thank you mr. chairman and thanks to all of our Witnesses for sharing your expertise and sounding the alarm on this an addition to the the experts and the those that are at the Dyess here I didn't want to just acknowledge and recognize representatives of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council who are also in the room with us today and we thank you for your good work the growing youth Vape they ping epidemic has taken the Commonwealth which I represent by storm across, is the state it is estimated that nearly one in five high schoolers and one in 20 Middle School age kids are using these products student Advocates report school bathrooms him turned into Jewel lounges that smell fruity and minty I've spent the last ten years of my life as an elected official advocating for a school nurse and every school and we've learned from our school nurses that eighty percent of high school students are vaping and that's from their youth risk behavior, surveys leaders at the local and state level in Massachusetts from our city council to our attorney general who was the one to initiate the first investigation into Jewels problematic marketing and sales practices and our Boston city council is looking to push we're hearing on Banning flavored vaping products but we have to act on the federal level and so I'd be remiss not to highlight how similar many of jewels tactics seem to be right out of the big tobacco, look for decades big tobacco targeted black communities to the point where almost 90 percent of all black smokers used menthols nearly 45 percent of black Menthol smokers State they would quit smoking if menthols were all together band so it is extremely editor disturbing we've been here before we don't need a bunch of studies the only studies we need are the millions of casualties that that are behind us and that we run the risk of seeing ahead of us so this is a, very disturbing the flavor crisis even worse for children 66 percent of whom the National Institute on drug abuse found believed e-cigarettes only contained flavors as we learned from the youth who spoke today and we thank you for telling your story it seems obvious that the elimination of flavors would help eliminate this confusion so dr. winning cough why our mental flavored tobacco products particularly exploitive in the context of e-cigarettes well thanks for the question the, tobacco industry has a long history of targeting mint and Menthol flavored tobacco products to African Americans and specifically African American children a recent study in the American Journal of preventive medicine however showed that the majority of Americans believe that mint and Menthol should be banned as a flavor in tobacco products now interestingly and contrary to what the tobacco industry and the tobacco Product Industry claims, claims if you just look at the opinions of blacks and African-Americans an even greater majority believed it should be banned, so I think no one's fooling anybody here agreed and aside from potentially pouring upon the black community Jewels marketing Playbook as we learned them from mrs. O'Leary has targeted children in Native populations mr. Bergman you were so disturbed by Jules practices a you created an organization to spread awareness of jewels dangers to families across the country you know that expression Hell hath no fury like a woman I don't need to make a bun about moms okay, because that's that's next level and so you know we thank you for your fierceness and your advocacy what if parents told you about how Jules marketing influence their children's use of the product well I wish we'd had those slides because I hope everyone will get to see them when you see the sexy young influencers that were giving this product away when you see how similar the old tobacco ads there it's they're almost identical so Julie, what it was doing and what we tell parents is you know you're not a bad parent because unfortunately as you have said the old everyone is doing it and the scary thing is in this case it's true it's stealth by Design and as you said we are very upset these are kids who would otherwise not have been initiated into tobacco use we're talking about kids known harm to Kids versus, potential benefit for adults I hope there is potential benefit for adults in general but known harm to kids who can't who can't make those decisions for themselves because they're being deceived through the use of social media that's a problem I want to pick up on the deception and how that affects adults missileer did Jewel make any claims to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe about its product helping people quit smoking did they claim that these, products were healthy, yes you can see and slide 21 from the my attachment that it states quote have smokers that can't quit Jewel has created a program where you can help them switch with minimal cost to you so using words like quits which cessation is implied and that was the impression of the concept of the tribal council members who were on the other end of this presentation I think that the other claim that was made was the harm reduction and slide six of their presentation they state, ation of combustible cigarettes is crucial to reduce risk of harm and on slide 12 vaping is a fraction of their risk of smoking at least 95% Los Hombres less harmful but I want to point out that in that study that found that that this was done with not Jewel but other e-cigarettes that had much less nicotine content, do I still have time here, am I at time or do I still have time, okay all right thank you mr. chairman thank you thank you congresswoman congresswoman Miller you have five minutes, okay thank you mr. chairman and thank you all for being here today my home state of West Virginia ranks among the top states in the nation of for the highest percentage of adult smokers about 26 percent of our population 38 million people in the United States smoke I agree that we need to ensure that we keep nicotine products like e-cigarettes out of the hands of Youth but we must also ensure that we do not, I regulate this industry to the point that they are no longer available for those people of legal age who would like to use them either recreationally or as a means to quit smoking when I was a child one of my chores was to empty the trash every day both of my parents were smokers that was really icky I will tell you if anything would keep you from smoking it would be emptying ashtrays every single day and, I believe it was in 1963 when the Surgeon General came out and said that cigarette smoking caused cancer and both my parents quit my father just plain old quit cold turkey my mother smoked 3/4 of a cigarette than half of a cigarette than a quarter of a cigarette she did it very slowly but that ashtray thing is what really kept me from ever wanting to smoke and coming into a house that smelled, like smoke it was really nasty doctor Neo Neo artha in your research do you find that most youth who Vape also utilize other nicotine or tobacco products as well, yes as I indicated in my testimony close to three quarters of kids at least based on the most recent survey data that we have have also been you know tried are using you know other other tobacco products is the use of e-cigarettes by youth correlated to them smoking cigarettes later in life well that's that's the million-dollar question that we're all concerned about in trying to figure out at least as we can, I mentioned as you know there is there is some statistical correlation I don't know if we can say that one causes the other that's a pretty high bar to prove scientifically but you know nonetheless you know I maintain my position I'm dreaming with everyone that we should you know kids should just not be using any tobacco or nicotine containing products, I know when I went to college the girls all had little cigarette cases and little things that they always carried and and often times I felt like is it more of a crutch because you wanted to do something with your hands or was it because it really was addicting often younger people you know they want to carry keys or they wanted they just want to have something to do with their hands and that's more of an observation, ation than a question in your testimony you talked about protecting youth from accessing nicotine products and giving smokers a useful tool to quit smoking and shouldn't be a trade-off and that we can do both of these things at the same time could you elaborate on suggestions on how you think we could accomplish both of these goals well I wish I had all the answers but I'm hoping you know that the FDA with you know the power of the tobacco, Control Act can work hard and I know they are working hard to figure out how to achieve both goals which is to minimize if not eliminate youth use and maximize the ability of adult smokers to access you know safe and effective products I think we're still in the early stages of figuring out you know which e-cigarette products, type products are going to prove to be the most useful but you know that's what the FDA is therefore to you know to review applications and and use their their scientific powers to determine which products are in fact fit for approval in regard to adult smokers how can the health risks associated with cigarettes be mitigated by the use of e-cigarettes well the major thing is if, cigarette smokers can switch completely to an e-cigarette product we know that that in fact will result in pretty quick changes in biological markers of harm that are normally associated with smoking cigarettes so in other words we have signals that their bodies are actually kind of getting better and improving but dr. jackler is right in saying that we need more information about long-term effects, of use of these products and so that's an area of active research but at least in the short-term it looks like you know people switch to these products they actually are in some ways improving their health you mean like coughing more like you know biological markers that are associated with higher risk of cancer so blood levels of certain chemicals things like that okay thank you mr. chairman thank you congresswoman and now, sure dasoni a 45 minutes thank you mr. chairman and thank you for having this hearing I must admit the longer you have these political jobs the more depressing as you can get sometimes when you see human beings doing things to other human beings I'm old enough to remember introducing a secondhand smoke ordinance as a restaurant owner in Concord California 30 years ago I'm also old enough to remember doing an ordinance at the county was a public health ordinance, and our hearings then showed very clearly the tobacco industry was marketing directly through retailers all across the country where they put their a placement of advertising's how close it was to other products that kids would be drawn to literally research that they had done showing the height when kids came in and I also remember being a restaurant owner and having own multiple liquor licenses that when we went through Mothers Against Drunk Driving were colleagues of mine in the restaurant business said well if we try to, more liability than will go out of business we should protect small business and thinking and talking to colleagues at the California Restaurant Association saying well why would we want to be in business if that's what and of course we pass laws that have helped with that so here we are again and Berkman I've had some fairly regular group of young people that's growing in my district in the San Francisco Bay Area come into my office and they're trying to do similar things, so with that we did with tackle tobacco settlement money you getting young people to help Advocate but they're also telling me stories pretty compelling that on their campuses this is pervasive and there's a reinforcement from the marketing from peer-to-peer that it's not dangerous that people have taken care of all that you've had the same experience I take it yes and actually we have a pave group parents against vaping Group in San Francisco where we're working, the time but yes peer-to-peer even now when there's been so much talk about the harmful contents of these sweet Jewel pods that known toxins the nicotine kids still don't get it right they think it's water vapor I mean we heard those numbers earlier and as you said we've been here before and we should not be here again and we don't want our kids to be guinea pigs for this experiment, especially when we saw what happened the first time around when big tobacco 0.1 1.0 targeted our kids jewel is Big tobacco 2.0 and we can't wait this is a Race Against Time if we don't act soon and take the flavors off the market because the flavors continue to hook the kids then this is a generation of nicotine addicts and worse in West Virginia for example I know that, remember just left the room but there is research that has given conclusive evidence of cardiovascular damage caused by e-cigarettes so there's no damage not only to developing brains but cardiovascularly and I keep hearing over and over we don't know yet we're waiting these are kids there's known harm now why wait and God forbid see what happened the first time around we don't have that, time to thank you dr. winnik 04 dr. jackler so secondhand smoke it strikes me in this is where we were effective with tobacco and particularly say in Northern California where it started in California as a public health issue to employees having been in the restaurant business in the 70s I'm dating myself you couldn't wear your clothing a second day because of the stench of tobacco someone who's never been a smoker why should it take long for us to look at the measurement in the content of what's in these products, and measure it against what we already know about secondhand smoke pediatricians worried a lot about this and in the family context we have some smokers which have gotten the message and smoke outside but for parents they'll be vaping right next to their child those ultrafine particles are getting into their children's lungs and in fact when they Vape indoors the entire surface of that home becomes coated in an ultra fine particulate of, of nicotine and other chemicals now kids interact with their environment in a very intense way they exhibit mouthing Behavior they breathe the from closed down to the floor and they may only weigh a tenth as much as adults so they end up eating house dust and getting in level of toxic toxic aerosol that's probably 20 times higher than what a non-smoking adult in that household would, get and that's concerning for us, dr. Eve anything and just quickly with just the place of use regulations around smoking and vaping need to parallel otherwise what happens is that smokers will use them in the workplace and recreational places in automobiles with their kids and things and that's not a good thing so those local policies are very important to parallel mr. Larry can you talk a little bit about how the industry is targeted Native Americans and the tribal community, I think there's been historical tactics by the tobacco industry to took our Target many groups that are at risk including American Indians as well as others that have been stated already but I think the the main thing is you know getting product to the reservation I think that tobacco industry feels a little bit and visible on the reservation we have you know no compliance checks that happen on the reservation by FDA because it's a Sovereign Nation so there's great concern about what jewel coming to the, Ian and trying to hide behind non-disclosure agreements could result in I've heard that there's multiple other tribes that have been approached by Jewel but I've really struggled to find anybody that's willing to speak with me about it and it's likely because that there's been nda's signed by these tribes so I think that it's ruthless the attempts that are that are going on to embed these at-risk populations thank you so much and thank you to all the panelists yield back mr. chairman, thank you Congressman Congressman growth when you have five minutes, okay I don't know a lot of people use e-cigarettes you sure don't see him around like you used to see cigarettes around when I was a child good grief when I was in high school at a Smokers Lounge in the high school but at least the one person I know well who babes credits this with stopping you know stopping drinking cigarette stopping smoking cigarettes and I wonder do you feel this is an effective way I'm at if that's true we're saving, lots of lives aren't we could you could you respond to the idea of is an effective way to stop smoking, there is certainly potential and that electronic cigarettes particularly those that are high nicotine that when they user Breeze them in as a similar spike in nicotine that the people must know by now that does it work or not work is this an effective way to stop smoking we actually don't know scientifically very well they're certainly anecdotes as in your friend some adults will dual-use smoke and vaping and keep their nicotine levels High even in places they can't smoke, so it can be a deterrent to adults certainly it is probably better than patches and gums but still marginal and I would just add that we've not seen strong evidence that flavored E-cigarettes are necessary for adults to stop smoking and I think if a manufacturer develops and flavored e-cigarette that generates data and proves that it would help adults quit smoking and not attract children then the manufacturer is able under the law to ask FDA to approve it as, a cessation device or authorized it as a new tobacco product but for now the evidence is strongly in favor of taking flavored Products off the market doctor he wanted to speak yeah so I just take a shoe with their there the notion that there's not strong evidence we do have you know the results of a randomized control trial which is the gold standard for scientific evidence published in and, the most prestigious medical journal in the world the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year demonstrating that you know smokers who managed to switch to e-cigarettes quit at twice the right compared to those who use nicotine replacement therapy so the evidence base is is building so you know I don't think we can any longer say that we don't we don't have evidence that these products that can help smokers, has quit well you know America least we're told is supposed to be a free country why do you think what what is the reason for these other people then to not want to allow people to use e-cigarettes if there is some strong evidence out there that it's a way to stop smoking what is their motivation you know well I I don't know I think a lot of this has to do with you know these are these are relatively new products there there are a lot of unknowns, and and I understand the the tendency to want to rely on you know proven methods such as you know medications and nicotine replacement therapy but this is now a consumer product that's kind of Taken things by storm and we're again we're seeing signals that are positive so from my point of view if this is if this is a type of product that actually is consumer friendly and is more apt to, we used by smokers compared to some of these other products then we ought to look for ways to leverage that opportunity to help smokers which okay I have one General thing you know they give us all this data and I'm not sure whether this is right or not I guess in 2018 the FDA claim that 20 percent of high school students Vaped in the last 30 days but I know how the world works of your buddies got a babe maybe you vape It also says here that only 6% used in more than, it is for month and only 4% describe themselves as daily users so you know it seems like one of those things the kids have one they passed around but really we're under 4% does anybody think those numbers are wrong that's exactly how tobacco use starts tobacco products began as an intermittent use and they gradually graduate to daily use so there's nothing surprising about that data in fact the standard the gold standard for assessing adolescent current tobacco use is past 30 days, so there's nothing unusual about that data Congressman me if I'm a I'm a mother of four children for teens and I can tell you that this is rampant you can ask you can I mean nobody we are here we are told and harassed and threatened all the time by the probe aping Community we're not prohibitionist we want the flavors that are hooking in the Kids Off the Mark I'm gonna run out of time so I'm just going to ask you so you're saying that when I have this FDA FDA data that only, less than four percent of the kids Vape everyday you think that FDA data is wrong I'm telling you that kids under report they don't admit it and then some of those early studies unless you ask someone if they're Julian if you ask them if they're vaping they will say no because kids do not associate vaping and Julie it is like Kleenex or Band-Aids and there have been articles written about this and studies written about this I know because my, son and I have been comped have commented on those stories kids think they're dueling they don't think they're vaping they don't think they're using E-Cigarettes they just know that they're dueling that's the truth I also ask you would you say that nicotine addiction is something that goes away after a couple of days or is it just a fad, I don't know I so I don't have an opinion well thank you we have two final lines of questioning three minutes each this going to be light a little bit of a lightning rod Round Here congresswoman Talib you have 3 minutes but it was getting so good in mr. chairman mr. mr. leery thank you so much for being here and I want to give you majority of my the time because I read on February 1st Jewel came, before your health committee of your tribe and they was proposing the product and so forth but you know one of the things I would love for you to talk about is you know the statement that they said is that quote the letter said from Joel were promote Jewel or the tribe said it was promote Jewel as a healthy way for patients to quit smoking Jewel wanted the tribes Health Department to provide the jewel starter kits for free of charge to tribal members trying to quit smoking as part of, are smoking cessation program and so if you can talk a little bit about that and you know who were in the room and I know some people had to sign some sort of right to be able to come forward and disclose and mr. chairman as masoli restarts I think for the record you know Jewel from a number of folks up here has misled the American people have a slide has used our broken system to be at honestly to Target and then manipulate and say that it's not going, posture and things and we can continue to say we're going to study study but I can tell you when I go into kids because I say well you know they always ask me what I do for a living I tell them you know I make laws and things and they're still looking at me I said you know when I was a kid when I went to a restaurant they'd say okay how many people in your party the second question the laska is do you want smoking or non-smoking section and all the kids look at me the second and third graders are like what are you talking about I said yeah they saw smoke and restaurants no way do they smoke on, airplanes all and hospitals is who you know and it's like these kids are like dope that's crazy but they used to Gaslight us to believe the second hand smoking wasn't killing us and I'm not going to sit here and allow this committee to be used by anybody even from the other side to say that e-cigarettes vaping jewel is not killing our people they are it's leading to health harms leading to addictions that are going to hurt people so with that I'm so sorry mrs. O'Leary you, have the rest of my time I really do want to put it in the record what they did in your tribe I share your passion thank you for your comments so what happened is when they came it was in front of initially the tribal council and that's when they handed out free product to our decision makers free product and we have council members now who are regular users of Jewel when it initiated at that meeting they were then rerouted back to the correct process which is through the committee level of the of the tribal government system so they went to the health committee and at that meeting, and that's when they made those claims of less harm and smoking cessation and I'll reiterate that it's that's not allowed they cannot claim smoking cessation or less harm at this point I also want to say that you know there's been a lot of questions about that it might be effective for smokers but there's also data suggests that for every one person who's able to quit using Jewel 81 kids will start so the rate at which the, smokers are finding this product helpful it's incredible the amount of uptake that we're seeing in our youth and I think that the tobacco industry in general as well as Jewel specifically targeting at-risk populations like American Indians and African-Americans and youth it's again I say ruthless there's no end in sight for these companies unless there's some regulations that take place by Congress in mr. chairman I hate calling a regulations because they've hijacked that word it's called accountability, thank you thank you congresswoman and our final three minute line of questioning mr. cloud, well with that buildup I just had three questions we'll try to get through and three minutes wanted to clear up the data I guess teen vaping uses up we talked with that overall teen cigarette uses down no in the latest year actually for the first year in my question was where's Mac so use yeah a teen teen uses increasing actually in the last year according to National Data from the CDC because there's difference, sets of data is that everybody agree with that I it may be a flat line but it's not increasing, the data show that it's increasing but we can show all the data I could submit it overall tobacco use I'd be interested to see the study mr. Niara you had, it's in my written testimony right okay yes I look through that why the increase why the decline I guess we can well I think that what we would have seen had Jewel not been around had e-cigarettes not been around I think we would have seen a very steep decrease in adolescent tobacco use and unfortunately what we've seen is a flat line as doc nayara mentions a slight uptick in the past year this is a problem, because what I when I asked kids only have you like one yeah go ahead I think we covered Doris what you're saying well if you look at the line weiser's yeah if you look at the patterns over the past you know for five years again we're at record lows for for youth smoking which you know is hard to reconcile with the fact that you know teen vaping is up those are just just the fact and when you say you smoking that includes, cigarette smoking no no just get cigarettes yeah that was my pleasure in Smoke total product uses up dramatically in the last few years okay let's put that includes vaping okay that's the question I was trying to get to thank you both jackler and Nero you touched on for a second on patches and other credits could you touch about 20 seconds on on e-cigarettes compared to those other alternative patches, has, what have you right so you know nicotine patches are a form of nicotine replacement therapy proven to be effective to help smokers quit again this one study appears to show that E-cigarettes are even better than nicotine patches but the my interpretation of that is that E-cigarettes are actually a form of nicotine replacement therapy they just more efficient they're better at doing it compared to products like patches okay and of course we're all talking outside the, context of teens when we're talking yes no this is for adults right how can policymakers ensure that non-combustible nicotine products like electronic cigarettes are available for smokers wanting to make a transition while limiting the access of them intended users like youth what are your recommendations I don't have any concrete recommendations because I think this is a very tough issue we're seeing a lot of suggestions coming out from folks in terms of different types of you know, Ian's in terms of where products can be sold maybe restricting flavors and so forth I think these are important conversations that we ought to continue to have to figure out the best road forward, I'll let dr. jackler finish, so high nicotine products like Jewel and it has exceptionally potent nicotine from my point of view should be available for by doctor's prescription for adult smokers I care very much about adult smokers and would like to have products that help them quit and I think it's a superior product compared with patches and gums but they should not be on the market to be bought over the counter and sweet and fruity flavors by kids, thank you very much doctor and thank you to the first panel for their testimony with regard to the panelists if you could please come back to the ante room we are going to switch out and we are going to have our final panelist Senator Dick Durbin and we'll hear from him so we'll take a two-minute break just to switch out the panels and please audience please stay seated for Senator Durbin,I swear, well, welcome Senator Dick Durbin to the committee on oversight and reform subcommittee on economic and consumer policy my favorite senior senator from my home state of Illinois Senator Dick Durbin needs no introduction on the issue of his Valiant advocacy efforts to combat smoking among Youth and also to combat smoking in, oil he is the author of the ban on smoking on flights In America which came into being in 1990 20 29 years ago when he was a member of this house and at that time powerful interests and the tobacco industry industry fought his efforts to put this law into place but now we know the tremendous positive, impact of that law and we have Senator Durbin to thank but he's also been an outstanding Advocate on the issue of fighting e-cigarettes for Youth and so we welcome him to our committee without objection sir your written statement statement will be made part of the record and with that Senator Durbin you are now recognized for your statement thank you chairman krishnamurthi and ranking member Cloud for holding this important hearing it's good to be back in the, Al's House Representatives and also to be at a hearing flanked by the campaign for tobacco-free kids seems like old times but I know today you are taking a close look at the role of Jewel and the FDA and how we've reached this point where we're facing literally in the words of the FDA of vaping epidemic you know the numbers the last year alone 80 percent increase in high school students vaping 50% increase in middle school students using e-cigarettes today because of, this is like Jewel and the accompanying kid-friendly flavors 4 million children Nationwide or vaping Jewel and other e-cigarette companies like to claim that their products are only meant for adults looking to quit cigarettes but a look at the facts quickly dispels that notion here's the starting point there is no clinical trial proving the jewel devices help adults quit smoking cigarettes none despite all the, rocketing claims and all the paid testimonials there is no credible medical evidence of jewels most fundamental marketing claim none further more than 20 percent of children under the age of 18 are using e-cigarettes compared with less than three percent of adults Jewel knows exactly where the money can be found and it's not from adults looking to quit smoking it's kids, today's youth vaping epidemic is a new version of an old battle that I'm personally familiar with I won't go into the details but on Friday November the 13th 1959 one week before my 15th birthday I stood at my father's Hospital bedside as he died from lung cancer two packs of camels a day he was 53 years old when I came to Congress I decided to make tobacco my issue, we had some success as you noted in 1987 in my third term in the house second term on the Appropriations Committee I successfully passed an Appropriations Amendment Banning smoking on 80% of airline flights in the United States it was a minor it was a major Miracle no one expected this young congressman from Illinois with the opposition of both Republican and Democratic Leadership to pass this measure in the floor, what they fail to understand is the House of Representatives is the largest frequent flyer Club in America and they were sick and tired of second-hand smoke on airplanes and voted with me the bill was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan despite big tobacco fighting all the way they called Mike band quote an intrusion on individual rights you may hear Echoes of that in this room today it was just the first step I didn't realize that eliminating this inconvenience was a Tipping Point, but it was it turned out that a lot of people thought well of secondhand smoke is dangerous on a plane why isn't it dangerous in a movie theater in a restaurant in a bowling alley, we also went on directly after big tobacco is efforts to a dick children which is why we made cigarettes more expensive with Texas that is the single greatest deterrent to Children turning to cigarettes we dumped Joe Camel in the Marlboro Man is part of a national lawsuit we prohibited kid-friendly flavors and cigarettes like strawberry and grape and since these historic changes the percentage of Youth smokers declined from 28%, sent in the year 2002 less than 8% today however anyone who believe that the multi-billion dollar tobacco industry would go quietly ignored the power of their greed and that's why we're here today losing their precious market share big tobacco put their researchers and marketers to work first they needed a new product that didn't carry the moral taint of cancer-causing tobacco even better if it looked like a, USB flash drive can easily slip into a kid's laptop they needed a campaign that included an unproven positive Health claim such as Jewels current make the switch slogan they relied on a multi-billion dollar twelve point eight billion dollar investment from an old standby Altria formerly known as Philip Morris they needed a special strategy focused on kids because they knew the children, for a variety of reasons the most susceptible susceptible new users of products it worked with cigarettes it was going to work again with Jewel and vaping how did they lower the kids I've got a bag full of men here all of the different flavors I won't go through them all but they include fruit medley gummy bear whipped cream unicorn poop razzleberry and cotton candy I'll go tell me that it's all about adults switching from cigarettes to vaping, finally and this is critical they needed the Food and Drug Administration to look the other way as their massive Empire mushroomed and metastasized unfortunately the FBI a FDA has been happy to serve as that accomplice delaying Common Sense regulation of the e-cigarette industry by years refusing to remove illegal products on the market and standing silent in the face of these false Health claims by Jewel I've made it clear to the acting FDA commissioner, dr. sharples and commissioner Gottlieb before him that fda's hapless spectatorship has to come to an end whether by law regulation court order or discovering the political will to get off the sidelines so what's been the result of big tobacco and big Vapes efforts combined with the fda's abject failure to regulate the industry despite their Authority between 2017 and 2018 the number of American teenagers using any tobacco product increased by nearly 40%, this was the largest single-year increase in youth tobacco use ever that's right all of our significant hard-earned gains to reduce youth use of tobacco products are being reversed because of e-cigarettes like Jewel and the accompanying kid-friendly flavors and all of the full page Jewel ads decrying children you know where you see them you see him in the he'll roll call political Washington Post New York Times Wall Street Journal, this isn't a new tactic that's exactly what big tobacco did when we said lay off the kids they bought full-page ads in the Wall Street Journal saying we don't want kids to smoke cigarettes how many kids do you think get up in the morning to read The Wall Street Journal exactly none this is just a PR campaign Now by Jewel once by big tobacco to try to say that they have a business model that really isn't directed at kids the facts tell us other words to combat, today's vaping epidemic I've introduced bipartisan and bicameral legislation to crack down on kid-friendly e-cigarette flavors I'm joined by Senator Lisa murkowski Republican of Alaska and representatives to get and Raskin our safe kids act would give e-cigarette companies one year to prove their products meet three criteria first companies would have to prove that their products actually help adults cigarette smokers to quit second they have to prove that, products don't harm the people using them third e-cigarette companies would have to prove their products do not cause children to start using nicotine if a federal tobacco 221 Bill moves this year and I think it might miss in it it's imperative that the legislation includes strong Provisions to crack down on kid-friendly e-cigarette flavors that are addicting our kids if someone who lost his father as a kid to smoke related lung cancer I had hope that e-cigarettes would prove to be a smoking cessation, is for adults to date there is no proof instead these devices and the candy dessert fruit flavors are causing children to develop this addiction at far greater rates than their helping adults quit smoking cigarettes a recent Dartmouth study found that e-cigarette use leads to 81 new smokers for everyone smoker who quits according to the truth initiative 15 to 17 years 17 year olds are 16 times more likely to use jul, compared to people over the age of 25 a recent study published in the journal for the American Medical Association found the teenagers who start vaping or three times more likely to go on to smoke cigarettes than teenagers who don't and consider this jewel is widely popular with kids and accounts for 70% of e-cigarette sales in the United States make no mistake Jewel now partnered with tobacco giant Altria is driving this epidemic, even as they come before this committee and posed for Holy pictures Congress waited for too long to start protecting children from cigarettes history is now repeating itself with e-cigarettes are in action combined with fda's complacency is dooming an entire new generation of children to nicotine addiction most parents care when their teenager is lost in a cloud of vapor smoke this Congress, I look forward to working with you in a bicameral basis to address this public health epidemic head-on I'll close by saying this I never dreamed when I went after taking cigarette smoking off of airplanes in my third term and the house for God's sake that I had a chance to win but I did the net result of it because of unforeseen developments was a change a dramatic change in America in their view toward smoking we stepped in at that moment finally and took on big tobacco the question, is can we work the bipartisan political will to take on big vaping now for the benefit of the young people sitting behind me and those Across America thank you mr. chairman thank you very much Senator Durbin for that eloquent statement and thank you for your efforts your lifelong efforts to combat nicotine use I want to thank all the panelists I want to thank the entire audience for taking time out of your busy schedules to be here part 2, of this very very important a hearing is tomorrow when we have the founder of Jewel before us at 2 p.m. in this very

Robinson in your article that we're particularly interested in about the effects of nicotine you it's called the role of nicotine in tobacco use you argue that people smoke because of kind of a paradox that both stimulates and relaxes them that you tell me what you mean by that, the article was written to get a common sense perspective on exactly what the title is the role of nicotine in tobacco use I think Common Sense tells you that the effects of nicotine and tobacco smoke are fundamentally different than addictive drugs such as heroin and cocaine which is of course what the Surgeon General has stated is a common sense approach as opposed to a chemical analysis yeah I think, you don't have to be a trained scientist to see the fundamental differences between the effects of nicotine cigarettes smoking and caffeine for instance and coffee drinking compared to addicting drugs this this was has been known for some time that was the precise Point made in the 1964 surgeon general's report that the role of nicotine in tobacco use is much closer to the role of caffeine and coffee drinking than it is to predict, drugs we think that is still fundamentally true now that's a common sense approach as opposed to a chemical analysis of nicotine in a chemical analysis of caffeine and that sort of thing well you can go into the science also the key that we focused on in that article the key distinction between nicotine caffeine and addicting drugs is the intoxicating effects of Addicting drugs the definition of addiction has always included, the concept of intoxication debilitation the disruption of the ability to think clearly perform simple tasks that's been issued you a fortune to that's been true throughout history and of course that does not apply the nicotine up until the 1988 surgeon general's report that when that when that requirement was dropped how does the nicotine act on people, I'm gonna quit chemically there are it reacts differently I think for different people in the effects are very we think there are certain beneficial effects of cigarette smoking the Surgeon General for instance would say that people smoke because they are addicted to nicotine when in fact we think if you asked someone aside from the enjoyment, that they say they obtained from smoking we think they get are the people report to very very specific effects one they report that it helps them relax helps calm them down helps them cope if you will with life's everyday stresses and strain secondly they reported helps in concentrate helps keep them alert that's the Paradox that you that you asked about previously this has been smokers have reported this for, time and more recently evidence for these effects have been demonstrated in scientific studies in the laboratory in our laboratory and in other Laboratories now those are the effects what physically happens to the person who uses nicotine in cigarettes the pharmacology of nicotine is very mild I don't know exactly what how to respond to what happens physically well person takes a puff, what happens when nicotine enters the body what happens to the brain what happens to nervous system that's that's not very well understood at this point this I see what happens what do you understand to happen the cigarette smoking nicotine has some very mild pharmacology associated with it it does interact with receptors in the brain the extent of that interaction is known to some extent but not very, we people report this mild relaxation stress reduction coping ability to concentrate better maintain alertness particularly in in boring or what psychologists called over learn tasks very simple task that's what that's what the effects are most noticed again those are behavioral kinds of effects I'm curious what you can tell us about the physical effects, Act of a nicotine being introduced into the body in terms of the brain and whether the brain and whether the body then wants to have more of this the there's little doubt that I think either the smoking opponents or or or us would agree that smoking is a pleasurable activity there is a certain amount of pleasure associated with that it's certainly not you mentioned before you for you for you for you present in any kind of Addicting drug other than that, describing the Mi pharmacology and I am not qualified to discuss at length with the specific receptor interactions are so you don't know whether the body craves nicotine or well I just would like to have it from time to time I think that the my John at dr. Robinson is describing the mild pharmacology when he describes the behavioral aspects nicotine is absorbed it does pack throughout the body, and it produces these behavioral effects that we just described I think that is the physical manifestation of nicotine is not it's not unlike caffeine when you drink coffee people who drink coffee with caffeine in it report an increase in alertness that's the physical manifestation of the caffeine being present if you drink decaffeinated coffee you're not going to report them that alert and and I guess I would add that as a psychologist, behavioral person is total behavioral effect is in the area of my expertise not necessarily the specific mechanisms underlying those behaviors now you've written several articles questioning the 1988 surgeon general's report explain to me what is what was wrong with that article without report well again we formulate a common sense perspective of that report basically, IE the physiologic and the behavioral effects of nicotine cigarette smoking are much closer to caffeine and coffee drinking than to any addicting drug known again this was known in 1964 it was stated quite clearly and in the 1964 surgeon general's report that the behavioral effects of nicotine are much closer to caffeine and to so the heroin or cocaine as the, as the 1988 surgeongeneral so you're saying that the Surgeon General got it right in 64 but got it wrong in 88 yes I'm much more comfortable with that approach in 64 are you comfortable with the idea that nicotine is addictive I think I think that's exactly why we wrote the article to put a common sense perspective on that on that claim from kind of standpoint do you think it's addictive no I don't think so not by any any classically accepted definition, of the word Addiction and the key that we focus on in the article is the intoxication that debilitation there's always been a fundamental part of the definition of a of an addicting drug I think that obviously nicotine does not produce any intoxication there's no debilitation there is no disruption and the ability to think clearly or perform simple tasks these are fundamental concepts of and, drug which is which is not exhibited by cigarette smoking nicotine the Surgeon General reviewed thousands of articles on this which concluded that this is addictive are you saying all those articles are wrong I'm saying I'm saying that the conclusion reached I have I have a serious disagreement for the reason we just stated there was no intoxication there was no debilitation does not affect anybody's ability to think clearly, or decide whether they should continue taking continue smoking there was a side there's no what whether there's there's no disruption of a person's ability to think clearly to to lose voluntary control over whether or not they continue taking or continue smoking so if you don't think people have any problem stopping I think if you if you look at the literature 45 to 50 million people have by the by the government's own numbers, it's smoking without 90-plus percent without any help without any intervention if you ask them they simply say willpower I'm not saying and we say that quite clearly in our article that which we think fundamentally cigarette smoking should be more accurately classified as a habit we're not saying that some people may not report difficulty giving up smoking like any habit like any well like Behavior or pleasure, if you give it up you may have difficulty doing that change fundamentally changing your behavior can be very difficult task ask anyone who's tried to stay on a diet without much success so I think that's true to some extent we better than okay, it's good some of you are detractors say you have an agenda of bias you work for tobacco companies what about that the fact that I work for tobacco company I don't think in any way influences My Views we conduct sound science here are Sciences scrutinized extremely carefully when we go to publish an article simply because of where we work my agenda I don't have one, speak I do the best science I can I published my opinions and refereed journals so that people can become detractors that's what science is all about put it out there and let's discuss it how many studies not funded by tobacco companies support your view I have no idea how many how many study is it possible is it possible that none I don't I would I have no idea I wouldn't say that but what would you say I don't know what number, of studies are funded or not funded by the industry versus was funded by government agencies which very specifically in the preface to the 1988 surgeon general's report stated quite clearly that one of the purposes of that report was to support a smoke-free Society by the year 2000 and and that would imply that funding a study in University would affect that study if we funded it and, and I don't agree with that we have funded people who actually work with Surgeon General and there they do not agree with the surgeon general's conclusion either and they really do of course many people do and many people don't many people quit on their own but many people can't many many people find some people find it difficult to quit it's like any habit it's like people who are very unwilling to stop drinking coffee how is it unlike an addiction, it's more like a habit the fundamental difference is that what dr. Robinson's already talked about is the issue of intoxication you don't have intoxication with smoking but that's an effect that among many effects I mean you don't have necessarily have Euphoria either but you can still be craving a continual supply of nicotine just as you could might crave crack cocaine the concept of intoxication is is a key focus of our article because, cuz it has been a key focus of the definition it is not a sideshow to the question of whether the body literally craves nicotine no I don't think so if you look at much of the smoking cessation work for example where they give supplements nicotine gum nicotine chewing gum or nicotine patches to people in an effort to get them to quit smoking what you find is the one thing that, the nicotine in the patches of the gun does not seem to affect as someone's desire to smoke a cigarette it does not impact on their own they're craving of your words for cigarette so I don't think that's true what do you conclude from that what do I can smoking is is a very complex behavioral process involving for some people different or I should say may involve different things for different people nicotine plays a role for, or some people I think so does the which which is associated with the Mi pharmacology that we've talked about the taste the feel if you look at Jed roses work over over the Duke University you see that's a very important component of whether the people are enjoy their cigarette smoke that they've achieved so it's a very there are sociological here at there are behavioral aspects totally apart from any of the chemistry, all of these combined in a package that we think more accurately should be defined as habit well let me ask you about that is a behavioral scientist the studies we've looked at show that as much as 40% of people want to quit smoking say they want to quit smoking and can't quit now are you saying that those people are lying about whether they want to quit enough I don't know I don't think they're lying and I don't know I have difficulty differentiating can't quit, it from won't quit obviously smokers are made to feel like second-class citizens it's very easy to answer yes I wish I could but I can't so you're think they're sort of fudging the question of whether they really well I think I think it's if you know if you ask me what I like what I like a banana split that didn't have any calories in any fat and it would help me slim down the answer is obviously yes but, underneath that it it should taste like a banana split feel like a banana split make me feel good like after I eat a banana split and I think that's what they're saying maybe maybe they're saying they want to quit but they still want all the attendant benefits that smoking is in this is MI pharmacology this relaxed straight seishin stress reduction the ability to concentrate those kinds of things from a behavioral standpoint, if people want to quit do they have a lot of difficulty doing it as I said the figures I've seen 90% of the people report simple willpower 90-plus percent who have successfully quit it doesn't mean some people will not have a difficult time it's a habit it's an enjoyable habit it's a pleasure you try and stop a something you enjoy yes you're going to miss it yes they'll be a tendency to want to do it then maybe it's difficult, to change a fundamental habit of behavior that's well ingrained in your life just behaviorally speaking not not physically speaking that's my opinion yes we were talking to somebody recently it's a backhoe industry person apparently said relating to the effects of tobacco whether there's an area for a or just functions of with and this person asked the question would you rather have a pilot who, had just stoked up a heroin or cocaine or one who is just smoked a cigarette the question that probably is answered rather quickly by both of you well and we're the people who posed that question in article well we talked to Jack Henning field who you know is a is a is in the field that studies you've looked at his studies he said that if you had a pilot who never smoked a cigarette before and who smoked before he flew that he missed the runway what do you think of that, don't think that studies ever been done but I would say that what we're talking about is is the effects of smoking cigarette smoke nicotine if you will in smokers and if you gave if you give someone a naive person excess amount of nicotine that what person someone who is not a not a smoker not experienced nicotine you give them it's easy to give them too much and interfere with their performance from because, you've given them a toxic amount so the first time a person smokes sometimes it's debilitating right some I don't think it's debilitating sometimes it's they get certainly negative negative feelings not in it probably because they have not learned how much is too much and this really speaks to this common-sense approach you know you posed the question who would you which plane would you rather be in someone shooting up an illicit drug or someone having a cup of coffee and smoking a cigarette, I think Common Sense tells us that I would rather be on a plane with somebody smoking a cigarette and having a cup of coffee rather than someone drinking alcohol or any of the drugs of abuse and this is this clear distinction that the Surgeon General has has not maintained in his in his latest report would you be comfortable on a plane where pie was taking his first cigarette well I don't think that a pilot's going to do that and let's let's try I do looking at your the, you're the people who have the understanding of the physical and psychological effects of this from your standpoint would you want to be on a plane and I think that's one let John is well I think the obvious things were talking about smokers and and smokers smoking a cigarette a pilot smoking a cigarette first one Walker first time who is a smoker who has experience with smoking will have will have not have any problem flying that airplane and I think that what we, we have done is the Surgeon General is blurring this distinction and as a result he runs the risk of trivializing this difference with hardcore drugs and I think that that's a mistake and we have we have always held this common-sense view that that when people smoke cigarettes it's a pleasing sensory experience with mild pharmacology we don't there's no reason to die that that's that's that's fact and and for some people, they find that very enjoyable they derive benefits from that they report that they reduces their stress they it increases their ability to concentrate and especially on monotonous tasks like flying an airplane I don't know if you've ever been in a cockpit of an airplane but I used to be a courier and I would sit in the cockpit and that's a very monotonous task flying an airplane and and Pilots drink coffee while they're flying and until recently they smoke cigarettes, and we think that Pilots know that that's a benefit that they derive from both coffee and smoking cigarettes okay let me get onto back to your article because it's a very interesting one this you say that it that nicotine has stimulatory and calming effects when did RJR first discovered a I don't know that are Jr.'s discovered that that's and literature 0 for 10 12 15 years, that's so-called nicotine Paradox the first person I'm familiar with is dr. Gilbert that we reference in that article who points out that in some instances nicotine seems to be that's the Paradox we've discussed seems to be able to lift concentration ability to remain attentive keep alert and yet other people or even interestingly the same people in different circumstances report that nicotine has, this stress reduction calming effect of which which we've demonstrated as I said not only in our laboratory below other Laboratories how they have all had the old camel add say get a lift from a camel they say and they you know they talk about the energizing effect that Camel cigarette let me just finish is this what you're talking about in your research I'm I don't think so because what I'm talking about is scientifically measured, I think what you've just referred to in the camel at is sort of like what I would say get that lift with a cup of coffee if you consider that the same thing I'm looking at scientifically definable constructs so you've known about this for a long time that it has a lift Factor as I said dr. Gilbert published an article I believe in 79 and I think he references some articles before then so, this Paradox has been discussed that if it's not a new discovery not particularly now you whether or not you believe nicotine is addictive you do state that it has some very specific effects on the body correct in what way in your well you say smoker satisfaction what is that this this is the again the mild pharmacology if you will the the benefits as we see them behaviorally, speaking this ability to reduce stress improve concentration of kind of this short-term memory scientifically measurable things that so it can stimulate it can call yes the question we're trying to get at here is that if RJ Reynolds believes that it can stimulate in akan Kong that it has a pharmacological effect why shouldn't cigarettes be regulated by the FDA, I think that it falls in the same category as drink as coffee coffee is is a natural substance that people like to use and smoking is the is Falls in that same category and historically it's not been regulated in the way that other substances are what do you think about that dr. Rose hi I agree with that I'm having a problem with that the, there's no specific as I said effects there's mild pharmacology different people report different results the same people report sometimes it helps calm you down sometimes it helps me concentrate so I think it is a very mild effects I don't know that there's anything that in some got Robinson studies we were surprised to see that some smokers don't absorb naked, team so we know there are a number of you a few we've seen numbers 10 to 20% who and then there are the people that are called chippers which smoke quite infrequent and and that's been of interest to researchers for some time I think that's a good point because glad you're has a gradual mentioned the belief or the or the, that smoking is just to obtain nicotine I think is a very naive very naive point of view well if it's one of the things that stalkers are doing you would acknowledge it correct we acknowledge it in article there is a role and and it does have them play a role for some people yes you talk a lot in your sales literature about smoker satisfaction right I don't have anything to do with our sales literature I I've seen maybe you could answer that question it's Locus has, action is a big party I write our enjoyment yes you want to bring that to your customers right well I think that we're in the business of providing a product that people choose to use and if you choose to send and we choose to provide the product that they're demanding there's a demand out there for cigarettes and and that demand people derive benefits from using our products and I think dr. Robinson's describe those benefits and part of that demand is, for nicotine and we believe that the man is for the pleasure and enjoyment derived from smoking and and we know that that if you try to sell cigarettes with some other vegetable Manhattan material in there that's been done in the past people are not interested in that so we are so cigarettes is don't have nicotine those are cigarettes that don't have negatives so nicotine is one of the prime factors in providing what you call smokers satisfaction I think dr. Robinson has, clearly pointed out that nicotine the mild pharmacology associated with smoking tobacco is something that's that people find enjoyable and so it's not unlike drinking coffee and the majority of coffee drinkers drink coffee with caffeine in it and you know there's there's they derive pleasure and enjoyment from that they also pick they have some there are benefits that they drive from that in terms of the alertness and what, but isn't it clear that this is a drug that you are providing to I think what we what is clear is that we have we're focusing on the clear distinction between smoking and coffee drinking and illicit drugs and it's a really a common sense but isn't isn't a nicotine a list of drug isn't it clear that it is a drug that is legal, smoking is a legal adult activity and just like coffee drinking and it's it's been used in society for a long time our customers smoke and they smoke for certain benefits and they smoke a drug and and correct but let's let's just follow the logic of what you're feeling is it they smoked for certain benefits coffee provide certain benefits heroin provide certain benefits we have a couple I certainly don't you do you drink coffee, no I don't would you do you think people who drink coffee drink a drug would you think of it that way I think that there are I mean I'm not a chemist I'm not a I'm not even a behavioral scientist but I think there probably are properties that that caffeine has that are somewhat like a drug but my question to you is orange smokers in fact smoking a drug I think that I've repeated that a few times is that people are smoking for a pleasing sensory, experience and the mild pharmacology associate in the but not all smokers we have we have evidence that we've reported that that shows that not all people absorb nicotine so we know that that not everyone is looking for that mild pharmacology we know that coffee drinkers a lot of coffee drinkers choose decaffeinated coffee and so it's a complex Behavior I think dr. Robinson is, quite familiar with that but isn't there a simple answer that nicotine is a drug and the smokers are imbibing nicotine I think the simple answer is that there are clear and distinct differences between using substances like smoking and coffee drinking and illicit drugs and that's a real Common Sense approach we feel very strongly about that well now the FDA defines a drug",0.8435902771666665,0.69569135,0.9128384

tattletales tonight 7:30 this is the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite good evening the justice department said today that the late J Edgar Hoover and other top FBI officials systematically misused funds and employees of, the Bureau for their own benefit Jim McManus has that report, for 11 months last year a special team of investigators headed by Justice Department lawyers dug deep into J Edgar Hoover's FBI they found that Hoover his close friend and Aid Clyde Tolson and other top FBI officials had abused their official positions and neglected their responsibilities it started at the top investigators report that Hoover a lifelong bachelor used FBI Craftsman and government materials to avoid the trials of the average homeowner they were supposed to be building exhibits for court trial, but FBI workers instead painted Jade girl Hoover's home they built a front Portico in a rear deck on the house serviced wiring and Home Appliances replace the entire lawn twice a year said Hoover's clocks polish the brass and rearrange the furniture and they did it all for nothing because the report says they were afraid of losing their jobs the report says associate director Tolson had FBI workers developed several patented devices including a power window opener one of those went to, resident Johnson's White House other misconduct charges are detailed against former assistant director John Moore former assistant director Nicholas Callahan who resigned last year at the Justice Department's request and the report notes that current director Clarence Kelly received goods and services but later reimbursed the FBI attorney general Griffin Bell said the misconduct of Hoover and some of his top aides has cast a shadow over the FBI in a national Press Club appearance Bell declined comment on the report, yeah but he said he sees a new day when government officials are presumed to be honest, I believe that we are reaching the end of the world get sin drawn I believe that the confidence of the American people has been restored in that government and that they are now willing to give those in government and opportunity to perform as public servants in the traditional sense the justice department plans no criminal or civil actions against the surviving former FBI officials the report says the statute of limitations may have expired, and the amounts of money involved are small compared to Legal costs attorney General Bells said director Kelly has taken steps to see that the misconduct does not happen again Jim McMahon has CBS News Washington attorney

jzgb0039,"you were asked whether cigarette smoking causes cancer your answer was quote I don't believe so you stand by that answer today and it's worse I hope the government will help kids like me because growing up around cigarette smoke is hard what would you say to Robert he wants to stop it, I never ever talk to his parents and see if accommodations could be made tonight tobacco Omicron this is ABC News Nightline reporting from Washington Ted Koppel on one score at least Henry Waxman Harbors no Illusions physically he is not the leading man, anger type of fella this is a showdown Waxman and his Congressional subcommittee were preparing to take on some pretty Heavy Hitters this morning no less than the chief Executives of the nation's top seven tobacco companies this man James Johnston heads-up r.j. Reynolds and yes he smokes but for six hours today there would be no smoking not in the hearing, my bleep to put it bluntly there was a fair amount of silliness to go around on both sides today I'll show you what we mean a little later but for all the showboating on the Congressional side and the disingenuousness on the industry side this is serious business if the Food and Drug Administration determines the tobacco companies manipulate nicotine in cigarettes they could label it a drug and the government could regulate cigarettes that's clearly the direction in which Henry Waxman, and the majority of his subcommittee are hit, this is an historic hearing for the first time ever the chief executive officers of our nation's tobacco companies are testifying together before the United States Congress this hearing marks the beginning of a new relationship between Congress and the tobacco companies the old rules are out the standards that apply to every other company is in Thomas blindly Republican of Virginia as in Bridge, in your tobacco over the past several weeks we have witnessed an unprecedented assault on Tobacco that has unfortunately been driven not by science but by press release I am proud to represent thousands of honest hard-working men and women who earn their livelihood producing This legal product I am proud of all that positive contributions to my community and I'll be damned if they ought to be sacrificed on the altar of political correctness there were in other words, a couple of allies on the panel but not many but tobacco Executives were not on friendly ground and so the dog at least rest and restricts their position on nicotine the claim that Philip Morris secretly adds nicotine during the manufacturing process to keep smokers addicted is false let me repeat we do not manipulate nicotine to addicts smokers lorillard makes no effort to keep secret any information about the nicotine, the content of our products at which point the gloves came off Henry Waxman were ridiculed the comparison made by tobacco Executives between their product and coffee tea sugar chocolate warm milk and Twinkies you and I both know that Twinkies don't kill a single American a year they may not add to a healthy diet but they don't kill difference between cigarettes and twinkies and the other product you mentioned is death, I'm sure you're aware that the Surgeon General and the American Medical Association estimates that cigarettes killed over 400,000 smokers every year putting aside your assertion that people accept this risk willingly do you agree with this estimate, do I agree with the estimate of 435,000 people I've heard from this committee this morning three or four different three or four different numbers my understanding of how that number if you don't agree with the number then give us your number how many smokers die each year smoke I will do I will explain now I want you to answer we have a limited time I do not know how many if you disagree with the surgeon general's opinion it is a computer-generated number that makes you John, I'm going to have to ask you to respond to my questions do you or do you not agree with the surgeon general's estimate of over 400,000 smokers die do not agree okay, do you know how many die each year I do not know how can you as a chief executive officer of a company manufacturing a product that's been accused of killing so many people not know this information how is it, I'm telling you that number is generated by a computer and it makes two important assumptions the first that virtually everyone who smokes and dies dies because they smoke unless they got run over by a bus and second that model allows people to die one two three four times I don't know how that can happen but that's what that model does mr. Tisch, I want to move to you for a moment in a deposition last year you are asked whether cigarette smoking causes cancer your answer was quote I don't believe so you stand by that answer today, do you understand how isolated you are in that belief from the entire scientific Community I do sir, you're the head of the manufacturer of a product that's been accused by the overwhelming scientific Community to cause cancer you don't know you have an interest in finding out I did Sir yes and, what have you done to pursue that interview we have looked at the data and the data that we have been able to see is all been statistical data that has not convinced me that smoking causes death it had degenerated into a dialogue of the deaf each side saying what it had come to say each side hearing only what it wanted to hear Congressman Ron Wyden of Oregon after citing evidence from World Health the AMA and the surgeon, Cyril on the addictiveness of cigarettes let me begin my questioning on matter of whether or not nicotine is addictive let me ask you first I'd like to just go down the row whether each of you believe that nicotine is not addictive I heard virtually all of you touch on it and just yes or no do you believe nicotine is not addictive I believe nicotine is not addictive yes mr. Johnson Congressman cigarettes and nicotine clear, Lee do not meet the classic definitions of addiction there is no toxic will take that as a no and again time is short if you could just I think each of you believe nicotine is not addictive we just would like to have this for the record I don't believe that nicotine or our products are addictive, I believe nicotine is not addictive, I believe that nicotine is not addictive, I believe nicotine is not addictive and I do believe that nicotine you sir if I may at this juncture I am somewhat appalled by the conduct of this hearing you invited responsible Executives here to devote their time and their honesty to the answers you overwhelm people with questions you ask yes or no and I would like to think about going to have an exchange here a true exchange for you to be informed rather than have your mind's made up we should be given chances in future questioning to, expand if necessary when everybody on the panel says the same thing and astonishingly says that in the same way as all of you did a moment ago when you affirm that you did not believe nicotine is addictive it raises the question about whether or not the response was rehearsed mr. Horgan did your lawyer tell you that you needed a firm today without equivocation that nicotine is addictive this is not addictive no one had to tell me anything about my opinions about addiction sir, did this group discussed the need to State clearly in the same words as you all did in the same words that nicotine is not addictive you absolutely I think that we get together and meet that's absolutely outrageous but the political theater was just getting warmed up on both sides will be back with that part of the story in a moment this is ABC News Nightline brought to you by John Deere, maybe it's because their friend playing America it's Millions but will his children and he's got the solution, they Robert funch he is a young man who testified at our hearing on secondhand smoke I'd sure like to have these Executives here and this young man is secondhand smoke a problem for little boys with asthma no doubt was there any reason Beyond dramatic Hokum for staging this confrontation no way hello my name is Robert James punches and I am set, years old I go to Auntie Mame Elementary School in Lake Ridge Virginia and I am in the first grade I like to ice skate play soccer and swim but sometimes is hard for me and do these things when I get sick with asthma and can't breathe very well this happens sometimes when I come in contact with tobacco smoke when I smell it I cough a lot and my eyes get red and real puffy my dream, thing becomes more difficult and often my chest gets real sore I also get headaches if I could I would tell the president to make it the law that no one smoke in public places we should do the same thing with cigarettes that they are doing with guns turn them in for money or things to get people off smoking I would also tell people who smoke it hurts them and it's specially other people to this is also important, Orton for parents who smoke at home to know to they need to realize what they're smoking does to others around them I hope the government will help kids like me because growing up around cigarette smoke is hard who are would help me to live like my friends and get to do all those things that I want like to do, Robert you you said it better than any member of Congress could possibly have said it I'd like to know what each of you say to Robert starting with you mr. Campbell I'd say, people that smoke around you Robert are inconsiderate and you should always ask them not to smoke in your company and have Robert talked to his parents and see if accommodations could be made all this business about accommodation is just great but the fact of the matter is when the rubber hits the road he's powerless it was a Shameless piece of political theater on the committee's part but then In fairness it must be said that they are dealing with an equally Shameless industry that pretends to see no correlation, ation whatsoever between a cartoon camel flogging cigarettes and kids as potential buyers now I want to ask question of I guess mr. Johnson, you said that you want to advertise for adults to change brands well I'll take you at your word but tell me what this ad is all about what adult is going to be influenced by this ad there's something for everyone at Joe's Place there's Joe's camel they're all these people having a wonderful time I don't hence the messaging a bunch of camels to an adult, these are cartoon figures fun just like Snoopy the dog cells Met Life Insurance just like Garfield the cat sells Embassy Suites Hotels we're not accusing them of targeting kids are we, well I think somebody ought to buy some life insurance are going to use this product I come to this hearing is a parent of a four-year-old and a ten-year-old and in a few years all of you the executives who are setting at the witness table are going to be using advertising like Joe Camel to try to hook my kids and a dictum to tobacco products, what I'd like to ask each of you with children is I like to have each of you if you had your preference would you want your kids or your grandkids to smoke or not smoke if you had your preference let's start with you mr. Kim well I have to accept that my children are going to take risks whether I like them to or not I would I would prefer my kids have no risks, mr. Congressman I do not want my children to smoke I do not want your children to smoke or anyone else's children to smoke thank you I want adults to thank you when the hearing was over committee chairman Waxman and one of the CEOs took time to size up what they had accomplished will have that when we come back, what are Jr.'s Jimmie Johnson was finally able to get out of the hearing room into the sunlight and light up, we were just talking a moment ago about political theater the your impression that that's what you were participating well I think that's really for the American public who watch this to decide but my interpretation is that there was not a genuine search for for the truth today what do you think they were looking for they were looking to score some political points it's unfortunate I came to this hearing with a mindset of I of the facts with me I, provide them I want to try to be helpful I want to try to discuss how and why our cigarettes are as they are there was a lot of political theater there to your knowledge them of course you should of course you intended we intended they intended it yes that was theater in the sense that we were talking about an important issue and and they wouldn't wouldn't acknowledge that, cigarettes is the public health problem that is it struck me I mean I'm just sitting there watching television for most of the day and then I came here for the last couple of hours it struck me as a dialogue of the death I don't think you were paying attention I don't think they were paying attention I hope that's not the case I tried mr. Koppel very hard to listen to me and I offered data I offered information I offered to have the committee come down and see what we what we do and our factories I'd love to have them come for a day, but our scientists talk to him let him meet our people and find out that they don't have two heads we're good honest hard-working people trying to sell illegal product to 2.3 million people engaged in this industry were today characterized as as murder but wasn't the word that any member of the committee used but I thought his testimony was really extraordinary in the early part where he said everybody who's against, just a kind of advertising they do or the anybody would like to see restrictions on smoking in public places or other things he said are people who are proposed Vision the cover of this week's Us news and World Report the cover of this week's Time Magazine put that very squarely should smoking be outlawed that is the question Ted for the American people to decide and for this car, Chris to acknowledge and and openly debate on love anybody on my committee this prohibition of it of cigarettes I'm not for Banning cigarettes if you had your choice if you could just sort of snap your fingers and say I'm not going to be a smoking would you do it I have stopped snap my fingers and I stopped smoking for seven years and I didn't go to smoke into the or anyplace else I made a decision to stop I didn't have to get locked up anywhere to do it, it was it the easiest thing I ever did no Ted it wasn't easy it was easier than what I've been trying to do for the last six months which is to lose 15 pounds I want to I need to and I am been able to do it why because I didn't make up my mind to do it I have never and I asked you earlier someone showed you a cigarette and I said I will not give you a cigarette if you are not a smoker that is always my policy I would never encourage, but chilling inside I would never encourage an adult to smoke never so basically all the advertising is simply to get people to switch from one brand to another brand no engines no advertising is designed to draw people into smoking in the first place not only isn't it designed to take it can't if I'm not interested in cigarettes as a category and add want learning there been studies all over the world that demonstrate their if you really are serious and saying we're not trying, to get more people to smoke let me first of all I find that if you'll forgive me for saying so disingenuous suggestion you're in the industry of trying to get more people to smoke if fewer and fewer people smoke every year then rgr is at least not going to be in the tobacco business much longer that I strongly disagree with that there are 30 million adult smokers who do not smoke RJ our brand that's my market I want to get a Marlboro smoker to try it, a Winston and hopefully I can make a better product than Marlboro and once they've tried my product they're going to stay with it the that's the most efficient use of my marketing dollars is to go after people who already smoked and I believe that for a minute and I believe that for a minute because you look at the number of people that are dying out each year close to 500 thousand four hundred thousand thirty thousand smokers and maybe another 50,000 people according to the American Medical Association breathing secondhand smoke and, dying each year they got to be replaced with new customers for this tobacco industry and if they want to get customers even make sense and it seems to Bear out by the statistics you go after kids you have two women got to minorities there that Joe Camel ad for some executive tell me the Joe Camel I had is simply to get an adult smoker to switch from one brand to another, it's it's nonsensical yet they were willing to sit there under oath and say those very things this is not a surprise to us that this is a declining industry kid this is not news we understand it we expect it will continue to climb and someday because smokers shoes themselves the globe or people choose not to smoke our industry may not exist, I'll be back in a moment with the program, millions of babies born out of wedlock a national catastrophe and one man's controversial solution stop welfare now that sound 2020 tomorrow on this ABC station and that's our report for tonight I'm Ted Koppel in Washington for all of us here at ABC News good night if you wish a printed transcript of this or any Nightline broadcast please send five dollars, to journal Graphics 1535 Grant Street Denver Colorado 80 203 or call area code 303 8313 9000",0.857782262962963,0.70202714,0.91283876
jzhh0257,"against media number three and the deposition of tithing time on the monitor is 1229 p.m. we are back on record, I'm going to hand you a document or marked as exhibit 16, and I'm sorry cancel I don't have a copy for you, all right well then you can just hand it over to take out without some cat a week, okay,okay, our last exhibit of the day oh wow music to your ears I'm sure you, we pull back out exhibit 11, what is this exhibit being referenced as for called well we'll talk about that 16 but I'm in London know what he's referring to it as, okay, okay and then flip over 2, that image, on exhibit 11, on page 5 of the attachment, and then flip over to page 4 of the document that I just handed you exhibit 16 for the record,the page numbers on S you said there's not I don't think that there is and I'm sorry about that actually there is on page looks like one but corresponding to no page number three no page number you said it's three or four for got it you with me yes sir you would agree with me that page 4 of exhibit 16 looks exactly like the image on page 5 of the attachment to exhibit 11 right, they look similar but I don't know what exhibit 16 is, and I understand that but all I'm trying to get for the record right now the image on page 5 looks exactly like, page 4 of exhibit 16 right direction for, yes so the image looks similar but it doesn't have corresponding reference material that's the Do Not disseminate sales training purposes only so I really don't know what exhibit 16 is sure no problem and that's what I'm getting to does this look like the master sales Aid, from nine years ago I have no idea no problem if I reference to you if I represent to you that exhibit 16 is the master sales ahead, would you have any reason to believe that that's not correct object to the form of the question okay so lack of foundation I don't understand your question because you use a double negative not to believe that it's not so if I arrived late well you were at some point familiar with the master sales eight right, potentially potentially have that time nine years ago yes but I can't tell you if this is it well it does it have the characteristics of what would be considered a master sales ain't actually know why not because typically it was in a hard copy where they were corresponding page to page and you would know by the brand Team whether it was FDA approved to be used in the field with a provider so that we can't tell you from this copied what this is I get that so it I'm sure the, the versions that you used were probably a lot more glossy than the copies that were provided that's not the issue I have no idea what this document is if it was approved by the FDA or not and so no problem and so, regardless let's go back to page 4 of exhibit 16 and page 5 of the attachment on exhibit 11, got both documents in front of you page 4 of exhibit 16 you've got okay so the same ones we're on I thought you were changing nope okay okay images look similar right, the images do okay and you would agree with me that exhibit 11 is for sales training purposes only not to be disseminated right States it all over the document states that all over the document so it's for sales training purposes and you would agree with me that on exhibit 11 under the image that looks a whole heck of a lot like page for on exhibit 16, that it direct sales people to use the chart from more, right I would just urge a disagree and not to be technical but on the page that you provided to me on every single page it says highly confidential attorneys Eyes Only oh that's just stuff that I attorneys put on it you can ignore that, can I ignore it it's on the same page I don't know what this I don't know what this document is well that was just put there by the lawyers that was just put there by the lawyers but it's on the same piece of paper I have no idea if this is approved to be used in the general public in front of a provider I get it and then well and then page 4, says under the under the two charts that are shown there on the right side you with me page for in is exhibit 16 okay you with me this is 16 yeah okay it says in a lab study conducted in healthy subjects in equals 11 hydrocodone Administration yielded a high plasma level of hydromorphone did I read that correctly, in the second column yes had stated on this document and it says less than 10 percent of individuals are poor cyp2d6 metabolizers did I read that correctly that's what it says on this document says the contribution of hydromorphone to the clinical effects of hydrocodone is unknown did I read that correctly yes it's unknown,okay very quickly let's do the same thing for page six of exhibit 11 of the attachment on 11, you with me come on and then on page 5 of exotic 16 go with you would agree that the image on Page 6 of the leg to exhibit 11 at the top looks an awful lot like page 5 of exhibit 16, it looks similar other than there's call-outs, with references on the first exhibit, and the call-outs you're talking about the numbers 1 2 3 4 that's correct which is references as to General reference information for training purposes only sure and then the image of the two on exhibit 11, is right next to that chart right, yes and that chart looks an awful lot like the chart that's in page 5 is of exhibit 16 yeah they look for me and then if you go to to a simpler time six or Page 6 of exhibit 11 to is the more on more paragraph right, the call it at the bottom not the less early the image yeah that's what I'm getting yeah the call out here and then and it says and that sales training purposes only document it says here you can use the more chart to illustrate the study delivery of medication provided by Excel Co did I read that correctly you did, okay so today we've seen some email correspondence where you were encouraging your sales folks to sell Exile go throughout your territory which included 10 and parts of Tennessee right, yes and we saw a couple of emails that were a reference pill Mills and one email that specifically referenced Tennessee being flooded with pill Mills right objection I recall seeing one by Heather as to interpretation sure so throughout your 21 months working for Covidien in the opioid space Did you ever once contact Mound productivity ins compliance, team and informed them that your sales team was reporting to you a flood of pill Mill activity in Tennessee which action absolutely not it's not my word to use the word flood did you ever once go to Mallinckrodt and covariance compliance team and ask them to examine opioid prescription rates in Tennessee, I think with leadership we were constantly examining that our representatives were representing axalta and the space of opioids to the pie and to the appropriate providers that were not abusing Therapies, did you ever once go to Mound crime convenient compliance team to report any activity as suspicious and ask them to flag or scrutinize any or opioid order as suspicious objection not that I working recall to exalt go, were you aware that Mallinckrodt has a generic, business that also manufactured and sold generic opioids, generally aware but I wasn't part of that side of the business that also I have no idea of their day-to-day business if I told you that, that side of the business and 85 million opioid pills and to Tennessee would that surprise you extraction form objection Foundation again I speculation I'm not part of that business I have no idea what they do day to day just asking you with that number shock you objection ask the nice not for me to speculate that wasn't part of that business would it cause you concern to learn that they sent 85 million pills into Tennessee same objections again I wouldn't speculate on what I'd had no first-hand knowledge, of it all, I promised 10 more minutes might've gone 11 I appreciate the time today sir look at you're off the hot seat mr. Dean not so quickly I have a couple questions, do you recall being asked earlier today about sales representatives being directed to call and Target list you recall that testimony yes did you yourself sir ever direct a sales representative to call on a doctor or other prescriber that made that sales representative uncomfortable absolutely not what was your direction in that regard if representative would come back to me whether it be the environment or they felt, like a anybody was doing anything inappropriate from a therapeutic standpoint or patience or the situation that they felt harassing they were instructed not to call in that office okay and did you ever when you gave that instruction to your Salesforce did you ever get any pushback from Mallinckrodt corporate for you selling sales representatives not to call on particular doctors absolutely not if we felt like it was inappropriate it was my job to Advocate on behalf of that Representatives the reasons why to my superiors, they were very open to that as long as we could give them context as to why we're asking them not to go to a particular spot for any reason okay with that I have no further questions at this time I've got a couple of follow-ups I'm sorry, how many times do you recall informing Mallinckrodt corporate that your representatives reported back to you something uncomfortable they saw in a singles me very rarely but it was a cute if they ever did and this is for South Carolina Georgia what western North Carolina and Tennessee it would apply to all within the district if they ever felt uncomfortable going anywhere and this would be with any Pharma company if you're not comfortable going into an environment where you feel like a provider was doing something inappropriately you are not expected to go there, r, did you, ever contact the compliance team about those doctors that were reported to you to flag any prescriptions for them is suspicious objection no I did not examine data to that granularity that would often be provided if there was any data that they wanted us to verify with a representative but that I didn't know the territories that end up meant to say yes or no was there an established protocol to go to the compliance team, and informs and of those problematics prescribers objection I don't have a definition for a problematic provider if there was a specific a cute story I would bubble that up to my senior leadership to handle has a CDC appropriate, who would have that been billed directly for me would have been Bill Nichols and would you have expected builder then inform the compliance team I would assume so but I can't speak for bills activities, how would you have done that would you have done that by email correspondence or a phone call email and/or phone depending on you know but again it was it was fairly rare so I wouldn't say it was a daily activity by any means what a surprise you to learn that we didn't find any emails between you and Bill Nichols where you were reporting a report from one of your sales representatives of a problematic prescriber we didn't find a single email like that direction form Foundation, it's not enough for me to speculate whether you were surprised or not well I'm asking you if if you would be surprised that we didn't find any such email same objections it's not for me to speculate with ro surprised or not you said that this happened very rarely can you quantify one time two time three times I can't recall from nine years ago it was rare, that's it for me thanks hold on one second Elizabeth do you have any questions, okay that concludes the deposition thank you mr. blue thank you Dean uses three the time",0.8429275709374999,0.6047194,0.9128386

kfjw0178,"good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you Bob for your kind introduction but it is really a delight to be with you this morning and I consider it also a privilege before I introduce our distinguished speakers I would like to set out the format each speaker will have 10 minutes to present his argument then for the next 15 minutes each can question, challenge the remarks of the other we have circulated cards in your packets that I think is the left side of the packet and if you have questions please note it on the card and as time permits them I will ask as many questions as possible, it is now my pleasure to introduce our first speaker, Alan Morrison has been a leader in public interest law for many many years he is now director of public citizen litigation group Mr Morrison has been a visiting law professor at Harvard and an Adjunct professor at New York University he served as Assistant Attorney Assistant Attorney General for the southern district of New York Mr Morrison is a graduate of the Harvard Law School and received his ba degree from Yale University, t, his interest in commercial speech dates back a number of years Mr Morrison was a member of the legal team that won the landmark Virginia pharmacy case which extended limited first amendment protection to commercial speech it is with great pleasure that I present to you Alan Morrison thank you very much my first words are to tell you that I'm probably going to disobey your, hands and speak for longer than 10 minutes I can talk fast but I probably can't get my talk down to 10 minutes I'm honored to be here but somewhat troubled I agreed to fill the slot opposite Barry Lynn but I find myself aligned with the forces of darkness my usual adversaries are making the arguments I'm making today I am find myself on the side of the oppressors of free speech the deniers of information the protectionist and the, paternalist so all of whom I've accused of various things from time to time as I've argued and litigated these issues for at least 15 years if not more my only Solace I guess is at the end of my little talk you'll see the perhaps I have a reversal positions from what I'm usually taking in at least one area my topic and proposition today is that a ban on the advertising of cigarettes is not only a good idea but it's, the to tional and it's not the end of the first amendment let me take you briefly on a journey along Tobacco Road as it's been dubbed here from my experiences of the Virginia pharmacy case I was privileged enough to be able to argue that case in the Supreme Court when we made the first real inroads on Commercial speech actually if you look at the opinion and Bigelow the year before where we had filed an amicus brief you'll see that's the real start of it but anyway people like to think the Virginia pharmacy is the, case and so since I argued that I'm willing to take the credit for it as I Was preparing for oral argument in the case one question occurred to me which was what's going to happen when the some justice says to me now I suppose Damaris and if we accept your analysis here then we would have to apply that to the advertising of cigarettes and would that be constitutional if someone ban the advertising of cigarettes and I carefully thought of my answer to the question and, and thought about it and thought about it and decided that I didn't have, the kind of answer that I wanted didn't have very much in the way to go on and I would simply say that the court had decided of course a couple years earlier in refusing to hear the case on the ban of advertising of cigarettes on television that that was the law for the time being fortunately I was not asked the question and so I didn't have to give an answer that I didn't know what it was and in fact over the years I continued not to have the answer to that question until fortunately, in case which I was not involved the Supreme Court answered the question for me in the case which many of you know the pasado's case a case involved a ban on the advertising in Puerto Rico of the gambling casinos there and Justice rehnquist writing for the majority of the Court said that of course the state is not put to a Hobson's choice of either Banning the advertising of gambling or Banning gambling entirely it is he said it would be quote odd indeed, close quote if that were the law well with all due respect Justice rehnquist then Mr Justice now mr. chief justice rehnquist I think that ask the question it doesn't answer it it's hard for me to see how just because something is odd indeed it makes it either constitutional or unconstitutional the fact is that even today I would suspect that we would have a lot of, difficulty under First Amendment analysis and the changes in the Airways and sustaining the ban on the advertisements of cigarettes on radio and television if it was simply on the grounds that it was simple it was merely a condition of a license of the licensee having to accept the license limited Airways are no longer really much of a factor anymore given cables and everything else and I would think it would be very difficult to sustain look at the opinion and Bigelow the year before where, and filed an amicus brief you'll see that's the real start of it but anyway people like to think the Virginia pharmacy is the case and so since I argued that I'm willing to take the credit for it as I Was preparing for oral argument in the case one question occurred to me which was what's going to happen when the some justice says to me now I suppose

radio and television if it was simply on the grounds that it was simple it was merely a condition of the license of the licensee having to accept the license limited Airways are no longer really much of a factor anymore given cables and everything else and I would think it would be very difficult to sustain on the grounds given in 1970, a or 71 a ban on Advertising simply because it happens to be going over the airwaves after all we could no more compel a broadcaster to put on religious programs of which he or she disapproved or in the in the fairy tale of Rumpelstiltskin give up the firstborn child as a condition of accepting a TV license and I don't think that the giving up a condition of a TV license would be good law anymore well if, not simply the law because it's odd indeed is there a constitutional analysis that can get us to the place where a ban on cigarette advertising would be constitutional it seems to me that you the answer is yes and if you go through the four-part test of Central Hudson you can get there rather directly first question the courts ask is is the product lawful answer is yes and is the advertising advertisement not false and misleading, adding the answer is of course the product is lawful and while many of us think that the advertisements are somewhat misleading it's hard to say that an advertisement that has nothing but a picture of two or three Attractive people on it can pass the ftc's test to false and misleading nor would I want them to have to do that so on that prong the advertisement is protected the question then becomes first what is the asserted, add interest in the ban on Advertising the interest in the ban on Advertising is that cigarettes kill people and the ban on Advertising will save people's lives surely that interest the interest in Saving Lives is a substantial one but the court has required more it requires that the interest be directly Advanced by the band proponents would undoubtedly say first that if you ban advertising that will get people to stop smoking cigarettes, I don't think anybody really believes that people do not smoke cigarettes once they've started because they see advertisements on television or radio or wherever else they see it in Billboards they stay don't stop because they can't stop for they don't choose to stop the real purpose and the only one that's defensible in my view is to prevent people from starting to smoke and particularly stopping people such as children from starting to smoke, that it seems to me provides a First Amendment basis for directly advancing the interest in Saving Lives then of course the last part of the test is that the band must be no more restrictive than necessary and for that one would start with the proposition that over the years Congress has increasingly been ratcheting up the level of warning first on the packages and, now since 1984 Congress has mandated warning labels in all advertisement of course the FTC had them in before but they were quite mild and so the question is what's the matter with that that it seems to me entirely proper for Congress to make a judgment that that has not worked that the warnings are not completely getting through and they've not getting through because of a variety of different things that Congress, Congress it seems to me has within its power to decide now of course the question would be asked how can an absolute ban be no more restrictive than necessary and of course the answer to that must be the Congress has to conclude that not that it's the least restrictive means but it's the least restrictive means that works and if Congress reasonably concludes as I think they could that other measures will not work but, ought to sustain that that band well what about the efforts that have been made in areas such as pornography to restrict the availability of the Forbidden advertisement or material to children by blocking our two hours in the day on television by not selling them in certain places by not displaying pornography publicly things like, that what about that the difficulty of course is that you can't isolate a cigarette advertising in the same way children read the same books magazines newspapers they go to the same ballparks and watched baseball games with big cigarettes advertisements up there and the only way to block out Children is to block out everyone if you're going to have it effective there are very few, media which are exclusively for adults and most of those probably don't advertise cigarettes anyway the last thing I suppose you could Envision is to really ratchet up the warning labels, and not have them labels for instance suppose it said the packet on the advertisement smoking kills or instead the manufacturer was required to place a skull and crossbone on that would that be less restrictive and more protective of the first amendment I am sure that if we got something like that the manufacturers would come in and say that's even worse because you are now making me say something that I don't believe and you requiring me to, spend my money to do it that's worse than a total ban and I think the court would be right in saying that but why in the end, having gone through this analysis why don't we just say as some of the opponents of this band are saying let's just go abolish cigarettes if you really want to save people's lives that's what you have to do, well why do you suppose many of the proponents are saying that because they know perfectly well that there is no chance in the world that Congress would do that we've lived through prohibition we are living through the War on Drugs for us to start a war on cigarettes would be Insanity of the first order and everybody knows it and that defense, is really not a defense at all of anything realistic that is not an option that we don't need a police state and if we're concerned about violations the First Amendment I'd be much more concerned about other violations of our constitutional rights if we had to have a ban on cigarette smoking, is there anything else about these advertisements that we ought to at least think about the Constitutional analysis well the first thing is if you look at cigarette advertisement you will see that there is virtually no informational quality about them at all they don't tell anybody anything at all unlike the ads in the Virginia pharmacy case where we had prescription prices of prescription drug information or in the lawyer advertising cases where mr. souder advertised at the, he could represent people and all kinds Shield cases, in in many of the other cases there was clear useful information that is available of course of course the court does not purport to pass on the utility of the information but if you read all of the First Amendment cases you will see quite clearly that the court not imparting it into its test but otherwise describing it in its analysis makes it clear that psychologically if not legally, at the importance of the information is a factor that the court that takes into account both for the benefit of the impart of the information and more importantly for the benefit of The Listener the second thing it's worth talking about is asking why cigarette advertising goes on today the companies say we are spending billions of dollars every year to prevent people from switching brands, now I respectfully suggest to you that that's awfully difficult to believe it simply doesn't make sense that smart business people and these are surely smart business people would spend that kind of money just to prevent people from switching Brands after all if they can send it to a ban on Advertising there would be no brand switching of any significant amount and they'd save billions of dollars doesn't that seem like a better way to do it no it seems pretty obvious to me that they're not preventing people, from switching Brands nor do they care about new cigarette manufacturers coming into the market and preventing the marketplace from being closed what they really are concerned about is replacing the 390,000 people who died from cigarette smoking every year and there's only one source of new victims and that's the young people of this country as you I'm sure have heard before ninety percent of the people who start smoking do so before they're 19 and most of them start much earlier when they're 10 12 14, in where and it's illegal to smoke in Most states and when Shirley children of that age are induced and seduced by the images of Glamour that the advertisements portray they are get in there early and I'm sure that if someday we had access to the strategy memos of the advertising agencies in the cigarette companies we would prove that which everybody recognizes which is that the the market for children, is the market that the advertising is being targeted for and the reason is that that's where the new people are coming in when children are not able to make up their mind to intelligently way of the risks and benefits from smoking as adults presumably can do and finally of course there's the special risk of addiction and people who are unable to stop smoking well say the the opponents of a ban on Advertising look, pasado's case the pasado's case went off on the grounds that there was an exception in the statute the exception was that you could advertise to the mainland people but you couldn't advertise to the natives of Puerto Rico yes that is true but in my judgment that made the statute more unconstitutional rather than less unconstitutional the sent their makes clear that part of the reason for The Descent has its concern about the overly paternalistic views of the Puerto Rican guy, legislature protecting only the natives from this information and not us folks from the mainland if anything I suggest to you that statute is much harder to defend than would a ban on Advertising be well I may not have convinced you at least some of you but I think that rightly or wrongly assuming that none of the recent additions to the Supreme Court would make any difference, and change the result that the decision in posadas clearly ordains and affirmance of a statute that would ban the advertising of all cigarettes I'll wrap it up by saying that many of the same reasons that support the constitutionality support the policy judgments and that, there is also I believe no real slippery slope that would cause the end of the first amendment everybody I submit would agree that tobacco is different from every other product what else after all kills nearly 400,000 people a year when used as intended I think that Congress can and will distinguish between tobacco and everything else and perhaps I who have, of challenging Congressional judgments from time to time have a great deal more confidence in the ability of Congress to make those distinctions than those who have come to support congress's judgment when it's favored their economic interest thank you very much, thank you mr. Morrison let me remind you please that there are cards in the left side of your packet that you can place any questions on and pass them up at the appropriate time and that I will ask as many questions as time allows it is now my pleasure to introduce Barry Lynn who was known in this town for many many years as mr. Free Speech as a long time legislative Council for the American civil liberties Union, mr. Lin became known as one magazine called him the most recognized advocate of free speech in America an ordained minister in the United Church of Christ mr. Lin is a frequent lecturer and debater on such topics as pornography separation of church and state compulsory national service campaign Finance reform and constitutional history, his National effort to discredit the attorney general's Commission on pornography earned him the 1987 First Amendment award from the Playboy Foundation we are pleased to have him here today to discuss the First Amendment implications proposed bans on Tobacco and other product advertising mr. Barrel in, thank you for that introduction mr. Free Speech was indeed the nicest thing anybody called me in this town I don't expect to see a dramatic interest in precedent on the part of many of the people sitting today on the United States Supreme Court people like David souter and soon Clarence Thomas I expect to see the Supreme Court of the United States doing a lot more of what Justice Marshall aptly characterize them as doing at the end of this term using raw power and that case he used the phrase about the overturning, of a decision a precedent that was merely one-year-old based on one change of position on the court and likewise if you look at the two First Amendment cases that have occurred in the last year of the United States Supreme Court term you find that both in the new dancing context and also in the context of the gag rule against doctors speaking about abortions in federally funded clinics that this Supreme Court seems to be looking for excuses to allow the government to censor speech, so I'm not going to sit here a stand here and try to predict what the United States Supreme Court would do with a ban on the advertising of tobacco products what I will say is that a serious reading both of commercial speech cases and a First Amendment cases generally would lead many reasonable people to construe that the only sensible context of free speech would be not to allow a ban on the advertising of tobacco products and since Alan Morrison has been willing to argue, the policy I think that the policy ought to be argued as well on grounds that transcend the issue of the Constitution itself and what the court will look at it and then on those more Transcendent policy concerns the kind of paternalism that Alan Morrison and his colleagues who would like to get rid of tobacco ads are articulating really will do a great deal more damage to the values of American life than allowing the Marlboro Man to ride and rope and even smoke his way right across the, second landscape what we're talking about is speech we're talking about yes commercial speech it does propose transactions but it is an articulation of yes information and ideas about lawful products when I heard Alan talk about the Central Hudson test I'd like to go back through that test because I draw some of the same conclusions and some different ones when I look at what that test is all about, according to the Central Hudson Supreme Court case if the expression that legislators are seeking to restrict concerns lawful activity and is not misleading commercial speech can be banned only in light of a substantial government interest which is directly I emphasize directly Advanced by the proposed regulation and only when this regulation is no more extensive than necessary to serve the governmental interest under this four prong test the Supreme Court should not should not tolerate, write a ban on or other regulation on do regulation of tobacco advertising and under the independent constitutional responsibility which the United States Congress ought to be exhibiting with greater frequency it to should recognize that the imposition of this kind of a ban clearly violates constitutional principles we know that smoking tobacco is a lawful product in 40 states it is however unlawful for miners to obtain tobacco products, it's but it's likewise unlawful in those States and most others for minors to obtain a large number of other products that are uniformly advertised in the American Media including Automobiles and as the Supreme Court said in the context of pornography once the government may not reduce the adult population to reading only what is fit for children think about that principle when we talk about or hear about the idea that if children go to the baseball game and see the ads that's a justification for getting rid of them for everyone, likewise the people that are entitled to use tobacco products do in my judgment have the right not to be denied information about the availability of that product simply because Alan and others are concerned that people will see it children will see it at the football game second threshold question in Central Hudson is it misleading if you had a truly misleading advertisement from a tobacco company it could be adjudicated before the Federal Trade Commission there are only occasional cases because tobacco companies are, are not doing misleading advertising to minors or to anyone else, a lot of critics of tobacco advertisement do something that Alan said he wasn't going to do and then did at the end they talked about generic deception that somehow there is an inherently misleading message in these in these commercials he said he wasn't he thought that that was not the case in regard to Tobacco ads and then he said at the end of his speech that these advertisements induce and seduce children that sounds to me like the same argument it's misleading it's somehow a hidden message here I was, King as I was driving in and to this event what is the hidden message in this new Camel cigarette campaign it is the message that if you smoke Camel cigarettes all of your friends will look like cartoon characters with large snouts or is it that if you smoke Camel cigarettes you two can spend your life in pool halls with the hard packs I don't know what the message is but I don't think it's one that is likely to seduce anybody and even in the, text where there happens to be a more attractive set of characters in those cartoon camels the idea that we regulated because it is interesting for people to watch is something that is likely to cause Peril to virtually every kind of advertisement all product advertising including tobacco in the main suggest that it is good and acceptable to use the product and that people should do it there is no advertising that I have ever seen that is designed to convince viewers that the use of their, product is going to make them miserable and unattractive I have never seen a single ad that would suggest that the only people that only people who use the product will find the only people able to or willing to date the users of those products would be people wearing bags over their heads that's not what advertising is designed to do makes everything look good and a part of good life, state of New York tried this argument that somehow there was an inherent secret message in the advertising of contraceptives and as Alan Morrison knows the Supreme Court rejected the idea of some kind of hidden implicit message that sex is good if you advertise contraceptives and reduced the ban eliminated the ban on the advertising of contraceptives in New York the second the third prongs of the Central Hudson test look at whether there is a substantial government interest asserted for regulation whether the interested, directly Advanced by that regulation obviously there is a legitimate government interest in the regulation of tobacco advertisements only if there is credible evidence that removal of such ads would directly Advance an interest in health by combating the use of tobacco in other words it's not enough to assert that Health would improve if people stopped using tobacco I agree with that the Congress would need to prove that banning the advertisements would somehow improve public health and that's, something in great doubt the evidence to date that advertising of tobacco is in fact a substantial reason why people begin the smoke is largely unpersuasive these advertisements as I think most of us know do not have a mesmerizing effect they do not lead people zombie-like from the advertisement in the subway to the nearest cigarette machine millions and millions of Americans every day here the Clarion call from Ritz and from Carlton and from cool and from camel and they still do, don't smoke cigarettes according to the 1989 surgeon general's report on smoking and the consequences of smoking it says testing the hypothesis that advertising encourages children to try tobacco products and initiate related behaviors typically find that advertising is ranked quite low on the list of relevant factors meanwhile it continues experimental studies considering the same relationship find that strength of interest in the tobacco ads correlates with smoking Behavior but do not examine links between, in this recall and smoking behavior in other words it is possible that smoking or an interest in smoking might affect the weariness of ads rather than ads encouraging smoking that was not written by Philip Morris that's right in the surgeon general's report, most advertising of cigarettes is in fact designed to retain market share because market share a single point is worth tens of millions of dollars that's why it's worth we don't have a ban Alan we don't have a band people are out there advertising competitive products in a competitive market and that's why that 1% share makes such a big difference, I'm always skeptical of using data from other countries and other cultures and making this debate but if you look at the data from other countries I think it is clear that where ADS have Advance have been imposed in those Nations there is not a reduction in the smoking by young people we have to recall a couple things for example the per capita consumption of adults of cigarette products in this country has been declining without a band at a higher rate than it is declining in, any nation that I'm aware of that has a smoking advertising or tobacco advertising ban in place likewise you can find a lot more young people smoking in places like Norway where they do have a ban on cigarette ads then in places like Hong Kong where there's even greater advertising of cigarettes and we find here in the United States because they don't have the electronic bands that we have here, ultimately we also need to recognize that people in our society do have the right to reject the significance or the persuasiveness of Health warnings or even to accept the risk of dangerous activities if they smoke because they like the taste of it or the stimulation of it or even Lord preserve us the image of smoking in this country people have a right to do so and they have a collateral right to learn through advertisements that others in fact, support that decision final prong of the Central Hudson test I do think is also relevant is this is a ban the least restrictive way isn't in fact narrowly tailored to meet some kind of need as the most recent case on Commercial speech asks I don't think it is I don't think it's even close because I don't think the United States government has done much as much as it could be doing to convince people using persuasion and scientific evidence that smoking, is bad for you the band that Alan Morrison is talking about is the most extreme remedy articulated for the problem there's an article by Gideon door and in the publication called regulation published back in 1979 that talks about how smoking increased when television advertising of cigarettes was banned he makes an interesting point here not one that is was obvious as he writes when advertising in the electronic media was banned, it was expected to decrease smoking the Assumption being that the commercials induced people particularly young people to take up the habit but he says the expectation was not met indeed cigarette consumption which had been declining before 1971 began to increase why is this well the number of public service announcements against smoking were reduced and subsequently the major factor that was contributing to decreased cigarette consumption was removed and I think the, occurrence of this laws was also suggested by the Surgeon General in that 1989 report where he said the anti-smoking PSAs public service announcements retarded per capita cigarette consumption far more than the cigarette ads boosted them so therefore there are some sound reasons to think about a ban or not to think about a band not only does it interject the government into the censorship business but in fact bands don't even work, I'd like to say one thing so that you realize just what this ban is that Alan Morrison says was upheld and the posadas case which involves casino gambling and Puerto Rico this is a most peculiar form of ban we think of bands we think of the elimination from the public view of something completely that's what a ban is well this is a band than Mickey Mouse is an elephant this is not a band if you go to Puerto Rico today, you are going to see plenty of Casino advertising why because the only restriction upheld by the court was a restriction of advertisements directed at the residents of Puerto Rico as a practical matter the residents of Puerto Rico in the main are reading the same media seeing the same Flyers the same newspapers in the same handouts that tourists see there was no practical Banning effect on the basis of this regulation of speech this was more of a, time place and manner restriction than it was a band and I think it's unfortunate that people who talk about posadas with less care than Alan does assume that bans mean the same thing that they mean in common parlance we can characterize all this as constitutional arguments are policy arguments are a little bit of each I think ultimately we have a question here fundamental fairness should we take out of the society all of the information, animation all of the advertising all of the speech of tobacco interests and their advertisers I know that the debate on smoking and health has continued and will continue with or without a band I just suggested continue without one I remember some of the Vigor of this debate over the past Brooke Shields remember and of those posters stuck cigarettes in her ears to demonstrate that cigarettes made people on attractive groups have been Distributing stickers that say things like kissing a smoker is like licking an ashtray, 3D artists add to the tobacconist slogan alive with pleasure the words and Dead with cancer all of that is free speech it is all more speech it is all contributing to the debate it is contributing to the debate without involving the United States government and the censoring of any information and in that regard it will in the long run be the only successful way to communicate opposition to the smoking of tobacco thank you, thank you mr. Lin we now have about 12 minutes and I'd like to divide the time up and give you gentlemen five minutes to exchange between yourself whatever questions or challenges you have I know it's very inadequate time but I also want to make sure that the audience has a chance to ask their questions and that doesn't give us too much time mrs. I took too much time, time in my opening speech I'll make my reply remarks very short one can search the pasado's opinion in vain for any hint that it's a time place and manner restriction and it surely is inconsistent with all the logic of the chief Justice's opinion if that's a time place and manner restriction then to quote my friend burial in Mickey Mouse is an elephant second I listened very carefully I think to what Barry said about all of the information that has been, being conveyed to the audience's of these ads yet I fail to understand at any point what information he was talking about price availability tar and nicotine content perhaps I don't know but I haven't seen any informational ads I've seen lots of image ads I've seen lots of other kinds of ads but no information and at least as a matter of policy we ought to say that if we are, conveying no information at all it's hard to understand why the ads are so necessary finally I'd like to say a word about studies surveys and statistics a wiser man that I once said that a statistician is a person who draws a mechanically precise line from an unwarranted assumption to a foregone conclusion and it seems to me that some of the statistics that are cited here are precisely in that category as I, then the messages is that as a result of a ban on Advertising of cigarette products in Norway we have more children smoking and as a result of the ban on the advertising of cigarettes on radio and television we have more people smoking in the United States from which I should conclude that the tobacco industry ought to be in favor of a ban on Advertising because that will boost their sales no other conclusion seems possible I suggest to you that that, it is not the correct premise to be drawn and if the tobacco industry thought that a ban on Advertising would boost their sales we would see them and not me supporting that legislation thank you, thank you mr. Morrison mr. Lin the absence of public service announcements is the argument here nobody is suggesting that when you ban the product advertising more people use it I'm simply explaining with these sister districts and I think Alan knows this that there is no credible evidence from these other countries that when you ban the advertisements it has a negative effect on the consumption of the product that is different from the normal reduction in consumption that is going, in most not in all but in most parts of the world today because people understand that smoking isn't good for you the logic of the posadas decision I'll stand by what I said I think it is a time place and manner it is not a band if the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court in that regard it sees it differently I can only say that any answer by a Justice rehnquist on almost any subject is not one which I personally would hold in high regard and I would be surprised if Alan Morrison does either the warnings he said don't get through, ooh well I guess warnings don't you know we all tell people not to do things they do them anyway because people don't always choose to believe the things the government tells them are right thank goodness for that in some regards and even if they do believe the warnings they may believe that there's a higher value a higher personal individual interest on their part in smoking that in listening to the health claims of the Surgeon General I would last one final Point there's no informational quality Allen says well there is theirs, case there's price there's tar and nicotine content there's a question of whether it's filtered or not and yes there's even the surgeon general's warning about what is dangerous about the product Allen says that's not information I hear this all the time I've even heard people say that there's no informational content in Debbie Does Dallas and they want to ban it for that reason it's the same old argument in fact the more I hear Alan Morrison talk about this the more I realize that this is just the same thing as everybody else's argument about why something, they ought to be banned I don't know if Alan Morrison wants to ban the ads for toys involving the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles I don't know if he wants to ban ads for for alcohol for sugared cereal but I can guarantee you of this there is someone like Alan Morrison and I know them that want to ban all of those advertisements they've all got adherence a Coterie of supporters who will make the same argument that there's something peculiarly dangerous about those products and the government ought to step in, and I tell them the same thing I'd say to Alan Morrison no thanks, thank you, Mr Morrison the first question is for you please, would you ban on cigarette advertising include such things as sponsorship of sporting events by cigarette companies example Virginia Slims tennis tournament and how would the band impact on television programming for example smoking and movies and so forth and TV shows, would I as a matter of policy say that the tournament could no longer be named as Virginia Slims I don't care it seems to me that they are entitled to put their name on something that they own just like they can put their name on the outside of their plant where they make Virginia Slims that doesn't bother me very much on the as far as the television is concerned I certainly think that we ought to carry through the existing band, on television by not allowing Marlboro to strategically place their ads in Centerfield and with knowing that the cameras are going to shoot from behind the catcher and spend most of the time focusing on Marlboro at the same time that they're focusing on the pitcher that the answer the whole thing yes, I think you did mr. Lin question for you how can you say there is no evidence that a ban is effective when the Canadian band has contributed to an impressive decline in smoking amongst their population especially the population under age 20 well because I think that the the short-lived nature of the Canadian band has yet to demonstrate the kind of Statistics that are going to demonstrate whether this really does work and remember in the countries where we have, longer-term evidence about the decline even if you see some what appears to be statistically significant alteration in the first few months it is one that disappears over the life of the ban I don't think there's any credible long-term evidence that banning tobacco advertisements in any other nation is going to be or has been effective at reducing consumption even among children, do you want to comment on that mr. Morris no well here's another question for you which deals partially with the same question what about Canada the court spent months reviewing the question of whether cigarette ads cause consumption and concluding that there is no evidence of such a connection, well I read the opinion or I should say I skimmed it was largely irrelevant to most of what I think it would be before us here today but I would also point out to you that while I'm not familiar with the system of judicial review in Canada in our country it's not the courts that would make that determination it would be the legislature and the courts would review it under a standard on which, every the legislature must have a reasonable basis and if you actually look at the evidence that is before the Congress on this issue as compared to the evidence that's before the legislators on other issues in which Banning took place or before the state courts which have been enormously restrictive lawyer advertising and when there's been essentially no evidence of any causal connection my clear impression is that the Congress would be given great deference by the court far more difference than the, trial judge in Canada who claims to have spent a year trying that case hearing Witnesses and essentially deciding what the legislature decided something that would never happen in this country I found his reasoning unpersuasive but in any event it would not happen in this country in which form but you're not suggesting you suggesting it's a good thing that the courts don't even look at the facts here I mean I think we're going to find people like well the Clarence Thomas for example when he was sitting on the federal appeals court with one exception never overturned, an agency decision no matter what the basis of it was because he doesn't see that as a rule of or the function of higher appellate courts I do think it's very dangerous therefore to assume that the ultimately this is an issue that ought to be decided by courts it should not be it should be decided by Congress who looks at this evidence and sees that this is the first time someone's talked about banning words advertisements images and that they should reject it and they should hold to a higher standard than the, Banning of something like a lawn dart this involves speech lawn darts denied I was hoping not to have to talk about the Clarence Thomas nomination here today so I think I'll not respond to the last remark, I have one last question for mr. Barry Lynn do you believe that cigarette companies truly are not interested as they claim in recruiting new smokers with attractive advertising even though the company's moves 5000 customers each day due to death and quitting I think the tobacco companies not only choose to and have the right to try to enlist people in the use of their product I don't think there's any difference therefore between that and every single other, act and service that is a part of American commercial advertising I think they have the right to do that I don't think that their goal is to intentionally lure children into the smoking of cigarettes and one of the most fascinating things I found is that every time that it's a backhoe company tries to enlist the public in some kind of a campaign to stop young people from using cigarettes then it is the anti-smoking groups who are the first ones out of the door saying it's phony it won't work we won't, cooperate with them and as a consequence I think some very good educational programs simply don't get taken seriously because the critics of smoking are so clear that they believe that there's some kind of a hidden agenda here that they don't even pay attention to the Quality ideas and suggestions that do come from the tobacco companies themselves mr. marzen do you have one last word, I've yet to see any quality ideas about quitting smoking Comfort the back of companies my case is made would you all join me and thank our distinguished speakers",0.8373536178070179,0.4986517,0.91283906
